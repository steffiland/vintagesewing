  <h2>Preface</h2>
<p>After many years of experience as an international lecturer and teacher of the various branches of the science and art of garment making, and by request of thousands of American women, the author was induced to write the first edition of this book, &quot;American Dressmaking Step by Step.&quot; Its purpose of answering the questions and working out the problems which have been and are now asked of her daily by the home and professional dressmaker and the novice is being fulfilled and its broad use and sincere appreciation by the American woman makes this second edition a necessity. The author has endeavored to present this instruction and information as briefly as possible in a clear, concise, comprehensible series of lessons, and in the manner easiest understood, quickest acquired, and most successfully applied.</p>
  <p>The woman who knows practically nothing about sewing or dressmaking must be taught from the beginning. In this book she will find a complete, consecutive, and systematic arrangement of lessons keyed with references, so that she may learn what to do first, how to proceed with the development of the garment, and how to correctly apply the finishing touches.</p>
  <p>When making a garment, even an experienced sewer is sometimes at a loss to know how to handle some particular point or problem. Therefore, each step of each lesson is keyed so that without waste of time or attention she may refer directly to the specific instruction desired, just as she would refer to a dictionary or encyclopedia for other information.</p>
  <p>To avoid repetition, the text has been consecutively arranged and each subject handled as a separate lesson. When the same problem appears later in the book, the detailed instruction is not repeated, but attention is called to the lesson in which that particular subject has been fully considered. Therefore, it is necessary at all times to follow carefully the references given and the &quot;step by step&quot; outline according to the arrangement found in this volume.</p>
  <p>The author found that this book, &quot;American Dressmaking Step by Step,&quot; presents the course in contents, form, and method most needed by the majority of women, and she earnestly hopes that this revised second edition will prove even more helpful to them in making their own garments, bringing out the maximum of beauty, of style, line, and effect, with the minimum of time, labor, and money.</p>

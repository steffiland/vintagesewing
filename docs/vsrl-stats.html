<h1><a name="maincont" id="maincont"></a>Statistics</h1>
<p>Our web host provides us with raw statistics of how our site was accessed.
  We run them through a program which lets us observe trends. How many visits
  did we have? How many unique visitors? How did they find us? How long did they
  stay? (Don't worry. As explained in our <a href="policies.html"> Policies</a>,
  we do not keep individual information. We do not know that Jane&nbsp;Tailor
  visited three times from a .edu host and spent 45 minutes
  viewing <em>How
  to Make
Gloves.</em>)</p>
<p>Some interesting, amusing, and bemusing items from our stats that we would
  like to share:</p>

<h3><a name="unexpected" id="unexpected"></a>Unexpected
  search phrases:</h3>
<p>Many of our visitors spend under 30 seconds on our site. Some find what they
  are looking for and leave; others realize they don't have time to look around,
  so they bookmark us and return later. Others were clearly looking for something
  else entirely. Here are some of the more out-of-place search phrases (except
  one or two truly scary ones). Do you suppose
  they
  ever found
  what they
  were
  looking
  for?</p>
<dl class="small">
  <dd><strong>&quot;how to make a nose taller&quot;</strong><em>&#8212;An interesting
      concept. They didn't find the answer, though they looked for it in the
      1928 <a href="1920s/28-mhd/mhd-16.html">Nu-Way Course
      in Millinery and Hat Design</a>.</em></dd>
  <dd><strong>&quot;pictures women shrunk by a shrink machine&quot; </strong><em>&#8212;As
      opposed to women shrunk by a washing machine? They landed in the <a href="1930s/36-hsc/hsc-1.html">1936 Home Sewing Course.</a></em></dd>
   <dd><strong>&quot;home made outer space costumes&quot;</strong>&#8212;<em>Were
    they startled to end up in the 1930<a href="1930s/30-paris/paris-10.html">
     Paris Frocks at Home</a>?</em></dd>
 <dd><strong>&quot;where to buy single edge gem razor blades&quot; </strong>&#8212;<em>They
     had to dig through many, many, many pages of results and landed 
      in the 1936 <a href="1930s/36-hsc/hsc-1.html">Home Sewing Course</a>. Were they in an unshaven stupor, blindly
     clicking every link?</em></dd>
 <dd><strong>&quot;how does wearing certain type of clothes effect your mile
     time&quot;    </strong>&#8212;<em>Surprisingly,
    we were the second
    result in Google: 1926 <a href="1920s/26-fcm/fcm-16.html">Nu-Way
    Course in Fashionable Clothes-Making</a>. I
    hope they figured out the difference between &quot;effect&quot; and &quot;affect&quot; and
    were able to find a useful answer to their question.</em>
 </dd>
 <dd><strong>&quot;disadvantage of soot and dust being added to the air to reflect
    sun light&quot;</strong>&#8212;<em>Again,
  we were on the first page of results in Google, landing them 
  in the 1931 <a href="1930s/31-ldc/ldc-03.html">Laundering and Dry Cleaning</a>.</em></dd>
</dl>
<h3><a name="referrers" id="referrers"></a>Top five referrers (other than search
  engines):</h3>
<p>Most of our visitors arrive directly (by bookmark or by typing &quot;VintageSewing.info&quot; in
    their browser's address bar) or through a search engine. A slowly growing
    number, however, are being referred by other sites. We wish to acknowledge
    these sites for helping our users find our site. </p>
<h4><span class="small">August  2004&#8212;</span></h4>
  <ol class="small">
    <ol>
      <li><a href="http://www.costumes.org/">The Costumer's 
        Manifesto</a></li>
      <li><em><a href="http://www.season.ru/links/sewing/">(It's 
        in Russian)</a></em></li>
      <li><a href="http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/">The 
        Online Books Page</a></li>

        Hip it Hurts</a></li>
    </ol>
  </ol>
<h3><a name="world" id="world"></a>Visitors from around the world:</h3>
<p>Our stats report visitors from a surprising number of countries (we'll spare
  you the list, unless enough of you request it), but even more gratifying, we
  have
  noticed links to our site (excluding search engines)
from sites based in:</p>
<ul>
  <li>.ca &#8212;Canada</li>
  <li>.de &#8212;Germany</li>
  <li>.lt &#8212;Lithuania</li>
  <li>.ru &#8212;Russia Federation</li>
  <li>.se &#8212;Sweden</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="bandwidth" id="bandwidth"></a>Bandwidth milestones</h3>
<p>In March 2004, we had over a million hits and exceeded our 15GB monthly allotment.
  (Yes, we realize &quot;hits&quot; are comparatively meaningless as a measure of traffic,
  but it was a cool milestone to reach.)</p>
<p>In May 2004, we again exceeded our bandwidth and discovered our <strong>former</strong> host
  simply shuts sites down instead of contacting the owner to authorize payment.
  We were shut down for four days. We now have a new host.</p>

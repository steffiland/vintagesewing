<p><a name="sizing" id="sizing"></a>At the time of this writing, there has been no established rule for sizing
  children's and infants' garments. One manufacturer may produce a size number
  6 garment which will prove to be somewhat larger than a similarly marked garment
  made by some other manufacturer. The mother must go into the store and purchase
  the garments according to the actual size of her child because some age 8 children
will wear size number 6 apparel and again the opposite may be quite true.</p>
<p>As is the case with adults, a government sponsored survey was started and
  through the aid of the schools, measurements were to be taken of thousands
  of children of varying ages and sizes in an attempt to determine the measurements
  of an <em>average</em> child of certain age. This may aid in standardizing measurements
  as far as the manufacturing is concerned, but still the mother will have to
  purchase her daughter's clothing according to her actual size rather than her
  age.</p>
<p>For one who contemplates entering this specialized field, it is a wise plan
  to make a careful study of the garments which are now being designed and shown
  in the stores. This can easily be accomplished by actually selling the merchandise
  in a children's and infants' department in any city. Customers soon voice objections
  to certain types of the apparel and in some cases, the small customer expresses
  her objection to certain points about the clothing while trying it on. Hundreds
  of clippings of good examples of functionally designed clothing for youngsters
  will do much to aid in visualizing shortcomings and may aid in stimulating
  ideas.</p>
<p>A few days spent at the lake shore during a week in summer gives excellent
  opportunity for the study of varying shapes and sizes of growing children from
  toddlers up. The designer should know her little customers before attempting
  to create apparel for them.</p>
<p><a name="trends" id="trends"></a>Children's and adolescents' clothing closely follows the trends shown in adult
  apparel. For the past several years &quot;mother and daughter&quot; dresses
  have been successfully sold in stores. Costume history books show us illustrations
  of small children dressed much like their parents. Fortunately, modern mothers
  are more sensible and they favor simple, well-cut clothing for their children
  and much of the fussiness of former years has been replaced with functional
  design of a high order. Yet these small folks want some interest in their clothing
  and clever designers cater to the interests of that age when they plan their
  designs and patterns.</p>
<p><a name="classification" id="classification"></a>Apparel for growing children may be classified roughly into three groups:
  infants', children's and girls'. The infants' clothing extends to about two
  years. The children's from two to eight years and the girls' from eight to
  sixteen. Boys' clothing would run about the same as girls'.</p>
<p>It is to be remembered that these do not represent sizes, but ages. Hence,
  the girl's sixteen dress would not be confused with the misses' size sixteen
    found in another department of a store. The girl's size sixteen is designed
    to meet the needs of a young growing girl, to appeal to her taste and to
  fit her undeveloped figure. It is merely an enlarged size eight or ten.</p>
<p><em><strong><a href="illust/12-238-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',442,334);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/12-238-a-t.jpg" alt="Girls' varying silhouettes" width="130" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em>As girls vary greatly from age eight to sixteen, when the growing girl reaches
  the size and contour which makes it impossible to purchase her clothing in
  the children's department, she will then go to the &quot;junior&quot; department
  and probably find that a size thirteen or fifteen will fit her.</p>
<p>In some cities, custom designers for growing girls and small children build
  successful following in business. Between the ages of ten and sixteen, many
  adolescent girls develop figures of disappointing proportions and the wise
  mother realizes the importance of properly designed clothing for her daughter
  at that age.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><a name="analysis" id="analysis"></a>Analysis of Children's Figures</em></h3>
<p>Because the small child from two to eight years of age has a tendency to have
  a bulge at the waistline instead of at the bust level, the control for this
  curve must be placed at the waistline. The back of the figure is flat through
  the shoulders and otherwise quite normal. Therefore the draft for the back
  sloper would appear quite similar to that which would be made for an adult.</p>
<p>When you have completed your draft for size four, you may notice that the
  shoulders have an excessive slope as compared to the adult draft. This is caused
  by the posture of the small child. The number 9 measurement increases in the
  girls' measurements which will bring the pitch of the shoulder upward slightly.</p>
<h3><em><a name="measure" id="measure"></a>How to Take Measurements Correctly</em></h3>
<p>Turn back to your previous instructions on basic measurements and read over
  the information once more. Check the <a href="mpd-02.html#measurements">adult
  measurement chart</a>  and
  the <a href="#kidmeasure">children's</a>. Note the similarity in points
  of measurement. Note that there is no need for a <em>Bust Point Height</em> or <em>Bust
  Point Width</em> in children's
  sloper drafts but it is necessary to use these measurements in the &quot;junior&quot; sizes.</p>
<p class="clear"><em><strong><a href="illust/12-238-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',960,344);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/12-238-b-t.jpg" alt="Figure 1" width="69" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em>Fig. 1 illustrates the method for determining the <em>Full Length</em> for a child's
  draft. The same measurement is used when making the front bodice draft. You
  will also note method shown for taking trouser side length. This could also
  be considered as a skirt length, when needed. Your <em>Center Bodice Length</em> added
  to your <em>Trouser Side Length</em> given in the measurement chart would give you <em>Full
  Length</em> in the standard sizes given in your chart. Skirt lengths vary for any
  given size and many manufacturers finish the skirt lengths in single sizes
  at a variety of lengths in just the same way hosiery is finished in a variety
  of leg lengths for a single foot size. In all cases, hems are generous to provide
  ample material for alterations.</p>
<p class="clear">Fig. 2 <a href="illust/12-239-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',320,326);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/12-239-b-t.jpg" alt="Snow suit" width="179" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a><a href="illust/12-239-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',280,138);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/12-239-a-t.jpg" alt="Figure 2" width="79" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a> a &quot;trunk measurement&quot; which is taken when garments
  such as snow-suits, full length one-piece sleeping garments, or &quot;creepers&quot; are
  being made. This is merely used as a checking measurement to make certain that
  the crotch depth is ample to give room for sitting. Separate trousers or panties
  will pull down at the waist, but the full length garments must be cut with
  an extra low crotch to provide ample &quot;trunk&quot; room.</p>
<p class="clear">The<em><strong><a href="illust/12-239-c.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',299,226);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/12-239-c-t.jpg" alt="Child climbing stairs" width="129" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em> <em>Hip Level</em> is more or less standard at 7 inches
  for adults, except in extra large sizes when it may be dropped to 8 or 9 inches.
  Due to the changing heights of children, it is established at 4 inches below
  the waistline for size 2 and increases one-half inch with each size until it
  reaches 7 inches.</p>
<p>As the armscyes in children's garments should be roomy, when taking measurements
  directly from an individual, take the <em>Side Bodice Length</em> about 2 inches below
  the armpit to produce a generous armscye. You will remember that in the adult's
  clothing we try to fit the sloper closely at that point.</p>
<p>Necklines are usually made somewhat looser than for the adult so this measurement
  should be taken generously when measuring an individual child.</p>
<p>Although the designer strives for a certain amount of style and fit in the
  child's garment, her first thought must be for the comfort of the wearer. Common
  sense must be employed when fitting the little sloper and when using it to
  produce new designs. The sloper becomes a measurement guide, particularly through
  the shoulder, neck and sleeve areas.</p>

<h3><em>Children's, Girls', Juniors' Measurement Chart</em></h3>
<p>Measurements for larger sizes in each of the following groups may be secured
  by adding the same gradation which is shown between the two sizes given in
  any one of the following groups. That is, there is 3/4 inch added to <em>Center
  Bodice Length</em> for size 2 to make size 4.</p>
<p>Add 3/4 inch to that measurement given for size 4 and you have the measurement
  for size 6 etc.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><strong><a href="illust/12-241.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',664,270);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/12-241-t.jpg" alt="Drafting the child's front sloper" width="78" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong><a name="front" id="front"></a>Drafting the Child's Front Sloper</em></h3>
<p>To draft the child's front sloper, follow the instructions given for drafting
  the adult front bodice as shown on <a href="mpd-02.html#frontbodice">page 60</a>. Proceed as far as and including
  10-D. From that point, follow the instructions given below:</p>
<p>B-E-9&#8212;Square a guide line left from point B on line A-B. Locate point E
  half way between lines A-B and the guide line #5. Connect E with point #9.</p>
<p>F-9&#8212;Measure the line B-E-9. Subtract one half <em>Front Waist Measurement</em> from
  this sum. Locate point F from point #9 a distance equal to that difference.</p>
<p>F-10&#8212;Connect point F with point #10.</p>
<p>G&#8212;10-G equals 10-9 in length. Label point G. Connect point G with point
  E.</p>
<p>H is squared from B to equal one half <em>Waist Measurement</em>.</p>
<p>I&#8212;Extend line 2-B downward a distance equal to <em>Hip Level</em> for draft
  size being made. Label point I.</p>
<p>J&#8212;Extend center front line B-I to desired skirt length. Label point J. (Equal
  to A-B plus 2 inches.)</p>
<p>K&#8212;Square a line from point I equal to one half the <em>Front Hip Measurement</em>.
  Label point K.</p>
<p>L&#8212;Square a line from point J equal to I-K plus one inch. Mark L. Connect
  points H-K-L.</p>
<p>M&#8212;Locate point M half way between L and J. Label M.</p>
<p>N&#8212;Make K-N equal to I-J in length. Label point N. Connect point N with point
  M.</p>
<p>Establish vertical grain indicator parallel to the center front line A-J.</p>
<p>Establish neckline and armscye curves as for the adult draft. With blue pencil
  trace out final pattern as is shown by white area in Fig. 1.</p>
<p>NOTE: The dart G-E-H produces the bulge <em>through the waistline area</em> E-B. Later
  in this text examples are given showing how this dart may be shifted to produce
  various cuts. As most small children's garments are cut from a few basic patterns,
  there is little occasion for any complicated shifting of this basic control.
  The point to keep in mind is the contour of the child's body, endeavoring to
  hide any defects. This may be accomplished by developing a limited number of
  well-shaped patterns. Any further design interest is then introduced through
  variation of fabrics, colors and trimming. When designing patterns which involve
  divisional lines, it is highly important that care be taken in establishing
  good proportions. Yokes, collar and cuff widths, braid trimmings and the size
  of design motifs in fabrics should be proportioned to the small garment.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><strong><a href="illust/12-242.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',644,261);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/12-242-t.jpg" alt="Drafting the child's back sloper" width="77" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong><a name="back" id="back"></a>Drafting the Child's Back Sloper</em></h3>
<p>To draft the child's back sloper, follow instructions given previously for
  drafting the adult back bodice (<a href="mpd-02.html#backbodice">see page 63</a>). Proceed as far as and including
  step 9-10. From that point, follow instructions given below. (<a href="#note">See
  NOTE on page 243</a>.)</p>
<p>D&#8212;Square a line left from point # 10 to intersect with line B-6. Mark this
  point D. It locates point of dart.</p>
<p>E&#8212;Square a line right from point B equal to distance that point D is from
  line A-B minus one-half inch. Label E.</p>
<p>Connect points B-E-9 and measure that line B-E-9. Subtract one-half <em>Back
  Waist Measurement</em> from this sum.</p>
<p>F&#8212;Locate point F from point #9 a distance equal to one third of that difference.
  Connect F and point # 10.</p>
<p>G&#8212;Locate point G from point E a distance equal to the remaining two thirds.
  Connect E and G with point D.</p>
<p>H&#8212;From point B on the line A-B, square a line left for 3/8 inch (use this
  in all children's sizes) and mark point H. Connect points A and H.</p>
<p>I&#8212;Extend the line A-H downward to desired skirt length. (Same amount used
  for the front.) Label point I. Connect points B and I.</p>
<p>J&#8212;On line B-I, from point B, measure downward a distance equal to <em>Hip
  Level</em>  and label point J.</p>
<p>K&#8212;From line H-I, square guide line to pass through J. From point J, on the
  guide line, measure off a distance equal to one-half <em>Back Hip Measurement</em>.
  Label point K.</p>
<p>L&#8212;From point I, on line H-I, square a line to the right which is equal to
  line J-K <em>plus</em> one inch. Label point L. Connect points F-K-L.</p>
<p>M&#8212;Locate this point half-way between points I and L.</p>
<p>N&#8212;Make K-N equal to the line J-I. Connect N and M.</p>
<p>O&#8212;Locate point O a distance from point J equal to line B-E <em>plus</em> one-half
  inch. Connect point O with points E and G.</p>
<p>Establish the grain indicators parallel to the line A-I. Establish neckline
  and armscye curves in same manner as for adult block. With blue pencil trace
  out the pattern as is shown by white area in Fig. 1.</p>
<p><a name="note" id="note"></a>NOTE: Frequently, individual children's measurements will produce no space
  between points 7 and 8. Usually children have rather straight, flat backs and
  the shoulder blades do not become very prominent until the child reaches the
  age of eight or ten.</p>
<h3><em><a name="sleeve" id="sleeve"></a>Drafting the Child's Sleeve Sloper</em></h3>
<p>To produce a draft for a child's sleeve sloper, the same method would be used
  as that used to produce a similar pattern for an adult. Use the measurements
  given for children appearing in the <a href="#chart">chart on page 240</a>. (<a href="mpd-04.html#where">See
  page 91</a>.)</p>
<h3><em><a name="block" id="block"></a>Adaptations of Children's Pattern Designs</em></h3>
<p>In order that you may study the functional characteristics commonly found
  in children's apparel, it would be advisable for the student to study fashion
  magazines and to clip and classify many examples of garments. These may be
  separated into types of garments, such as sleeping apparel, dresses and coats.
  These groups may then be sorted according to cut, such as yokes, styles, bodice
  and skirt dresses and those which provide the shaping through vertical seams.
  The latter would be largely princess types. The following diagrams illustrate
  representative types of these three classifications.</p>
<p>Aside from the careful selection of suitable fabrics, colors and trim, the
  designer of children's apparel works very much as the designer for adult apparel.
  A close understanding of the habits and preferences of the small child is essential
  to creation of original designs which will have an immediate appeal to the
  child and to the mother.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><strong><a href="illust/12-243.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',382,642);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/12-243-t.jpg" alt="Fullness under yoke" width="301" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong><a name="fullness" id="fullness"></a>Fullness Under Yoke</em></h3>
<p>The straight full dress, attached to a yoke is a popular cut for the small
  girl. It looks well on the chubby tot and also on the thin body. Note the tiny
  puffed sleeves, the little flat scalloped collar and the use of bows as a trimming.</p>
<p>The dart, which produces extra length in the front of the garment is moved
  up under the yoke. The straight side seam removes the fit provided in the sloper.
  Extra fullness is provided in the front by slashing. Pleats, gathers or smocking
  could be used. A similar amount of fullness could also appear in the back section.
  Puffed sleeve is produced in the same manner as for an adult. Note short length
  of sleeve.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><strong><a href="illust/12-244-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',304,614);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/12-244-a-t.jpg" alt="Combination fitting" width="366" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong><a name="combo" id="combo"></a>Combination Fitting</em></h3>
<p>This little dress has a seamed waistline in the front with a straight back
  which is adjusted to the figure by means of a sash. As long as the garment
  opens at the front, one might add a simple inverted pleat at the center back
  which would give additional sweep to the back of the skirt. The extra fullness
  held by the band across the front hides the curve of the body and at the same
  time produces a pinafore effect which is youthful and charming on her little
  plump figure.</p>
<p>Note method for cutting this sleeve which is merely a &quot;cap.&quot; The
  lower edge of the sleeve and the armscye are finished with a binding put on
  in one operation.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><strong><a href="illust/12-244-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',312,684);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/12-244-b-t.jpg" alt="Vertical fitting" width="398" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong><a name="vertical" id="vertical"></a>Vertical Fitting</em></h3>
<p>Fig. 3 shows method for producing the pattern, which is simple. Note how the
  waistline dart is folded out, and divisional seam line placed to fall on point
  of basic dart. Flat collar would be cut from basic sloper in usual manner.
  Note position of grain indicator in front side section (Fig. 4). The two back
  sections (Fig. 5) closely resemble adult's pattern. Degree of waistline fitting
  may be reduced if wished. Normal seam allowances, generous hem should be added.
  Note darted sleeve in sketch, as for an adult.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><strong><a href="illust/12-245-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',243,598);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/12-245-a-t.jpg" alt="Styles of hoods" width="454" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em><a name="hoods" id="hoods"></a>HOOD</h3>
<p>The detachable or attached hoods have proved so practical for outdoor sports,
  they are added to many such garments designed for adults as well as children.
  The following diagrams show the method used for producing such a pattern. When
  the muslin has been made, a close fit may be added wherever desired. It is
  well to remember, however that it must be loose enough to be worn over another
  head covering and it must also provide enough freedom to move the head.</p>
<p class="clear"><em><strong><a href="illust/12-245-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',574,383);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/12-245-b-t.jpg" alt="Drafting the hood" width="115" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em>Arrange
  back and front bodice slopers against' guide line as is shown in Fig. 5. </p>
<p>The line A-B is an extension of center front bodice.</p>
<p>See Fig. 6 for method for taking measurements.</p>
<p>AB- measurement taken from base of throat to center top of head plus one inch.</p>
<p>D- is eye level.</p>
<p>DF- Depth of back of head and is squared from AB.</p>
<p>DE- desired amount to extend beyond edge of face and is also squared from
  point D.</p>
<p>B-G equals DE and is squared from point B. B-H equals DF and is squared from
  point B.</p>
<p>Draw shape of the back of the hood as desired&#8212; square, curved or pointed.
  As point F is a measurement point denoting required depth for size of head,
  line D-F should not be shortened in this shaping process.</p>
<p>If hood is to start from V-shaped neckline as shown in Fig. 3, the measurement
  A-B should be taken from the point of the neckline. Normal neckline A-K shown
  in diagram is used for most hood designs. Front edge G-E-A may be shaped as
  desired. A draw-string or elastic can be used about the face or a contrasting
  shaped cuff facing shown in Figs. 1 and 3.</p>

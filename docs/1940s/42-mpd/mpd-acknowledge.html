  <h2>    Acknowledgement</h2>
  <p>    MY ILLUSTRATOR, Elizabeth Rocheford, made all explanatory 
      sketches simple and clear. Without her interest, talent and cooperation,
    this book would not have been possible.  </p>
  <p>Further acknowledgment is extended to Susan Stewart Foley for her splendid
    cooperation in the testing and comparing of suggested methods of procedure.
    The help which she and her students extended was most valuable. I also pay
    high tribute to Beatrice Borman for suggestions and criticisms that are the
    direct result of her experience in the application of the block system in
    manufacturing firms. And to Jeanne Kimball Winters for her cheerful cooperation
    as a novice in testing the lucidness of the instructions and text.</p>
  <p>And finally, I wish to express my thanks and appreciation to Elaine Platou
    whose copywriting and editorial criticisms have been of inestimable value.
    Without the encouragement and the stimulus given me by past graduates my
    book might never have been completed. It is, in no sense, the work of an
    individual.</p>
  <p>An expression of appreciation is owed the late Charles Kaplan, former chairman
    of the Pattern Making Department of the Central High School for Needle Trades
    in New York City, for his personal instruction, and to his daughter Esther
    for her assistance while I was a student in her classes.</p>
  <p>Fully three decades ago, Mr. Kaplan was doing research towards the development
    of a fitted foundation pattern to serve as a practical basis to creating
    original designs. His earlier books, Sixteen Lessons on the Principles of
    Pattern Making as Applied to Women's and Children's Apparel, Principles and
    Problems of Pattern Making as Applied to Women's Apparel original and revised
    editions, printed and copyrighted in 1932, 1935 and 1937, respectively, presented
    simplified methods for drafting foundation patterns that far excelled others
    then outmoded. Mr. Kaplan's late works, &quot;Principles and Problems of
    Pattern-making,&quot; Books I and II, published and copyrighted in 1939 and
    1940 respectively, and coauthored by his daughter Esther, augmented his earlier
    findings and illustrated the use of the foundation pattern in creating original
    designs.</p>
  <p>The teachings of these two far-sighted individuals have materially influenced
    the rapid growth and interest in clothing design in our country.</p>
  <p>Their books were used with permission of the copyright owners.</p>
  <p>Further acknowledgment is also given to the authors of many valuable volumes:</p>
  <p><span class="small">PRACTICAL DRESS DESIGN, <em>by Mabel
        Irwin</em></span></p>
  <p><span class="small">RECURRING CYCLES OF FASHION, <em>by Agnes Brooks Young</em></span></p>
  <p><span class="small">YOUR CLOTHES AND PERSONALITY, <em>by Mildred Graves Ryan</em></span></p>
  <p><span class="small">LANGUAGE OF FASHION, <em>by Mary Brooks Picken</em></span></p>
  <p><span class="small">PATTERN AND DRESS DESIGN, <em>by Josephine Eddy and Elizabeth
        Wiley</em></span></p>
  <p><span class="small">ART IN EVERYDAY LIFE, <em>by Harriet and Yetta Goldstein</em></span></p>
  <p><span class="small">PATTERN DRAFTING AND GRADING, <em>by M. Rohr</em></span></p>
  <p><span class="small">SIMPLICITY SEWING BOOK, <em>Simplicity Pattern Company</em></span></p>
  <p><span class="small">VOGUE'S BOOK OF SMART DRESSMAKING, <em>Conde Nast Publishing
        Company</em></span></p>

        Bureau of Home Economics</em></span></p>
  <p><span class="small">BRESSMAKING MADE EASY, <em>McCall Company</em></span></p>
  <p> I also wish to acknowledge my debt to the authors of numerous other volumes
    used in research, and to the trade publications such as <em>Women's Wear
    Daily, Vogue, Harper's Bazaar</em> and <em>Mademoiselle</em>, for data on
    fashion influences, trends, et cetera.</p>

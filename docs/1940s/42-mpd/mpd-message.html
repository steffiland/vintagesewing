  <h2>    <font

			face="Arial">Author's Message to the Reader</font></h2>
  <p>    <em>THIS BOOK reveals the secrets of cutting smart patterns that professionals
      know will produce smart, graceful apparel. The pattern is the design for
      a garment. It is to the dress designer what the blue print is to the architect.
      Only well-cut garments have STYLE; and this style is achieved only through
      clever shaping, careful placing of the grain of the fabric, exaggeration
      of the silhouette at just the right point. As the pattern is, so the finished
  gown will be. </em> </p>
  <p><em>The book is, in no sense, a substitute for specialized classroom training
      in the art of pattern making. There is NO substitute for the close association
      and helpful criticism which a student enjoys under the personal supervision
      of an instructor. Neither is it to be construed as a substitute for valuable
      knowledge gained through those years of experience which form so integral
      a part in the growth and development of the creative mind. It is rather
      with the hope that it will prove of true value to the reader as guide and
      reference that the book is offered.</em></p>
  <p><em>This volume should serve to freshen the knowledge of present-day designers
      who acquired training before the modern block system had reached its present
      stage of development and perfection. It should be valuable to manufacturers
      who see the importance of maintaining a library of reference manuals for
      their designers, so that methods for the production of such silhouettes
      as again return to fashion favor can be quickly confirmed. Or, this book
      will supplement knowledge acquired through tedious apprenticeship. It should
      be of pertinent value to dressmakers who have improvised their own methods
      for cutting patterns for customers' garments.</em></p>
  <p>Hobbyists<em>, not content to remain in the amateur ranks of &quot;home
      sewers&quot; who use the commercial patterns which provide the designs
      and styles for them, can, through careful study of this text and the consequent
      wording of its problems, attain a professional attitude in their work,
      thereby deriving greater pleasure and satisfaction from their efforts.
      The book will also aid them in the adaptation of commercial patterns to
      their own individual figure dimensions, through the use of a personal &quot;block&quot; pattern,
      which may be drafted from the instructions given in these pages. </em>Home
      Economics instructors<em>, aware of the steady change taking place in their
      field, will find that it contains much information which should be valuable
      in the teaching of young students who are adapting commercial patterns
      to uncertain figure proportions. </em>Teachers in Vocational Schools<em> will
      immediately recognize its value.</em></p>
  <p><em>Many books and periodicals have been written devoted to home sewing
      methods, adjusting commercial patterns, alterations, and other phases of
      clothing construction. Information set forth in these pages is presented
      from the professional point of view. Both the technical steps of procedure
      in making patterns and the artistic principles employedhave been included
      and discussed. These pages reveal countless secrets which heretofore have
      been jealously guarded by fashion workers.</em></p>
  <p><em>Facts in these pages have been set down in the manner they would be
      and have been given in verbal form to students enrolled in the classroom.
      When these pages were first assembled, they were intended to be used merely
      as a supplement for classroom instruction and demonstration. Methods of
      procedure which have been suggested and diagrammed are not essentially
      original. They are the result of years of experiment with many suggested
      methods. Undoubtedly, many still can be somewhat improved. It is the author's
      plan to revise this text in future editions that may serve to keep the
      subject matter currently up-to-date.</em></p>
  <p><em>As early as the thirteenth century, an enterprising French tailor devised
      a crude set of basic patterns made from thin slabs of wood. From these,
      a few varieties of design could be developed which reflected the fashionable
      silhouette of that era. But the Guild of Tailors restrained him from commercializing
      his wood-pattern slabs&#8212;because, in so doing, he might reveal the
      secrets of their profession to the common classes. Even in this modern
      day, when so much depends upon the cultivation of our creative minds in
      America, we have modern versions of that &quot;guild of tailors&quot; We
      have craftsmen and creators who are jealously secretive of their knowledge.
      These shortsighted individuals fail to realize, however, that, though basic
      principles of a craft or art be made available to everyone, only a limited
      number of truly creative and artistic persons rise to recognition and leadership
      in the interpretation of this knowledge. And these few people, in each
      generation, receive recognition and tribute commensurate with their individual
      talent and ability.</em></p>
  <p><em>Our modern &quot;guild of tailors&quot; overlooks the fact, too, that
      our present-day art has been endowed by the unselfish teachings of artists
      of a former day. Without this endowment, how little could our artistically
      gifted men and women of today reveal their talents! Costume designing is
      an art. As in all other related arts&#8212;painting, music, sculpture,
      architecture, and literature&#8212;ambitious students find much available
      reference material for supplementary reading. They acquire their first
      basic training in established schools; they go to museums and libraries
      to search further&#8212;to gain that deeper appreciation of what has been
      accomplished by artists before them.</em></p>
  <p><em>With an honest modesty does the writer submit this &quot;reference manual&quot; as
      her initial contributory effort toward the development and cultivation
      of creative fashion design in America.</em></p>

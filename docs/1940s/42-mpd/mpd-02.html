<h3><em><a name="slopers" id="slopers"></a>Slopers in the Industry</em></h3>
  <p>While studying the foregoing problems you learned how the foundation pattern
    may be the means of cutting new designs. This &quot;block system&quot; of
    pattern designing is being generally used in the garment manufacturing industry.
    You have also learned that although additional drapery or &quot;fullness&quot; may
    be inserted, the basic measurements in the garment will not change and the
    new garment will remain the same &quot;size.&quot; Now that you have discovered
    the advantages of this system, you are probably eager to learn how to take
    body measurements so that a sloper may be made for an individual.</p>
  <p>The next step will be to study the way to take these measurements used to
    draft a sloper. These measurements are furnished for your convenience. When
    you have completed a standard, full size sloper draft, you will then measure
    up your own model form and from your own set of measurements, you will draft
    a model size sloper which must become the basis for producing the remaining
    pattern designs.</p>
  <p>The foundation pattern, or sloper, is used by designers who work in manufacturing
    plants where standard size garments are created. It is now being used by
    the people who originate the designs for commercial patterns. And it may
    also be used by the custom designers who produce wardrobes for customers
    who do not have proportionate figures. It is an American made system and
    its development has come in recent years.</p>
  <p>As mentioned before, it is important that you realize that, up to this time,
    there is no &quot;perfect&quot; set of measurements which represent any certain
    size ready-to-wear garment found in our retail stores and produced in our
    many garment manufacturing plants. At this time, each manufacturer's designer
    perfects what he believes to be the ideal size 16 sloper, for example, and
    all new designs are produced from that sloper. Whatever changes may be made
    from year to year are brought about because of complaints from store buyers
    who are selling his designs to the public. If he receives numerous complaints
    that all his designs require alterations in the waistline, for example, then
    he may make a new sloper for the new season which has a half inch change
    in the size of the waist.</p>
  <p>But there is another important governing factor which the designer must
    recognize. The basic silhouette of the corseted feminine figure changes gradually
    from year to year. Corset designers watch the trends also and one year the
    ideal feminine figure may have a small waistline with rounded hips. The next
    year the fashionable silhouette may be the narrow hip line and lifted bust.
    Fashionable women buy good foundation garments and these garments aid in
    giving them the ideal silhouette to wear the clothes of that season. Hence,
    the designer of high quality apparel may change the shape of his basic slopers
    slightly from year to year
    to make sure that all of his finished garments will fit nicely over the newly
    designed foundation garments. Obviously, low price garment manufacturers
    do not observe these slight changes as do the manufacturers of high style
    clothing. Women who purchase inexpensive clothing are not as keenly fashion
    conscious and maintain a &quot;normal&quot; silhouette by wearing just average
    girdles.</p>
  <p>As there is no standard set of measurements, you might buy a size 16 dress
    in one store and find that no alteration would be needed. But you might buy
    another same size dress in the same department and that would require several
    adjustments. The second garment had come from a manufacturing plant where
    a different set of slopers were used. As all retail stores purchase their
    stock from many manufacturers, this varies the stock enough to please more
    women.</p>
  <p>You are now ready to learn to draft a sloper. Study the following diagrams
    and instructions carefully.</p>
  <h3><em><a name="drafting" id="drafting"></a>How <strong><a href="illust/02-56.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',392,383);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/02-56-t.jpg" alt="Figures 1 and 2" width="140" height="143" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>to Take Measurements Correctly</em></h3>
  <p>Before attempting to measure a figure, take time to check your tapeline
    against your ruler for accuracy. Due to possible imperfections, you may find
    a minute difference. As the square is used in making the drafts and the tapeline
    used in getting the measurements, if there is a difference, you can make
    allowances accordingly.</p>
  <p>Black dots on diagrams represent points at which measurements are to be
    taken. Note that vertical bodice measurements are taken to the bottom of
    the waistline tape. When taking vertical hip measurements, start with the
    bottom of the tape and measure downward.</p>
<p><em>Measurement Points </em></p>
  <span class="small"><dd>A Center Base of Neck. </dd>
    <dd> B Center Waist Point. </dd>
    <dd> C Neck Shoulder Point. </dd>
    <dd> D Shoulder Tip Point. </dd>
    <dd> E Armpit.</dd>
    <dd> F Side Waist Point.</dd>
    <dd> G Bust Point (Shoulder Blade in back.)</dd>
    <dd> H Side Hip Point.</dd></span>

  <p>Note that all points except A, G and B are common to both back and front
    of figure. Point G aids in determining length of basic control dart in back
    and front.</p>
  <h3><em><a name="where" id="where"></a>Where Measurements are Taken</em></h3>
  <p>On the following pages is a detailed description of each measurement. In
    preparation for the time when you will make a draft from measurements which
    you will take yourself, go through the procedure, using your tapeline. This
    will help you to visualize each measurement as it is used in drafting the
    sloper. Tailors soon learn the convenience of memorizing measurements and
    the order of taking them. You should do the same. As you rehearse this procedure,
    repeat the name of each measurement you are taking. You will have memorized
    them, in order, with this repeated practice.</p>
  <p>Measurements should be taken with the tapeline smooth, but not stretched.
    Every individual has a slightly different &quot;touch&quot; with the tapeline.
    Several people could take measurements of a single person or dress form and
    the results would vary one eighth of an inch at certain spots. Before starting
    to make a draft from your own measurements of the figure, check your results
    a second time to make certain you are right.</p>
  <p>Take all <em>vertical</em> measurements on the same half of the figure, both back
    and front. Then, if the dress form or individual being measured is not identical
    on each side, the variation will be immediately noted when fitting the completed
    muslin.</p>
  <p>1. <em>Center Bodice Length</em>: Taken from Center Base of Neck to Center
    Waist Point. Fig 1. (Take this measurement slightly loose, dependent upon
    depth of the division
    between the breasts.)</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><strong><a href="illust/02-57.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',392,729);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/02-57-t.jpg" alt="Figures 1 through 4" width="381" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em>2. <em>Full Bodice Length</em>: Taken from Shoulder Neck Point to Waistline. Fig.
    1. (This measurement should fall over the point of the bust.)</p>
  <p>3. <em>Across Measurement</em>: Taken across the dress form at a point 4
    inches below Center Base of Neck. (This measurement is sometimes referred
    to as
    the &quot;chest&quot; and &quot;shoulder&quot; measurement. It aids in shaping
    the armscye of the draft.) Fig. 2.</p>
  <p>4. <em>Shoulder Point Width</em>: Taken from Shoulder Tip Point to Shoulder Tip Point,
    with the tapeline falling upon the Center Base of the Neck. Fig. 2. (This
    measurement also aids in shaping the armscye of the draft.)</p>
  <p>5. <em>Full Bodice Width</em>: Taken across the dress form, from side to
    side, at a position on a level with the point of the bust. Fig. 2. (On individuals
    this position may vary somewhat. If customer has very low, heavy bustline,
    allow an extra half inch to measurement.)</p>
  <p>6. <em>Shoulder Pitch</em>: Taken from Shoulder Tip Point, down across the point
    of the bust to Center Waist Point. Fig. 3. (Although a person may have broad
    shoulders, they may still be sloped. This measurement records the posture
    of the figure.)</p>
  <p>7. <em>Shoulder Width</em>: Taken from Shoulder Tip Point to Shoulder Neck Point.
    Fig. 3. (Individuals may have broad shoulders but a small neck. This measurement
    aids in determining the size of the neckline in the draft.)</p>
  <p>8. <em>Neck Measurement</em>: Shoulder Neck Point to Shoulder Neck Point on opposite
    side. Fig. 3. (Sizes and shapes of necklines are dependent upon the manner
    with which the head and shoulders are carried.)</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><strong><a href="illust/02-58.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',384,734);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/02-58-t.jpg" alt="Figures 1 through 4" width="392" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em>9. <em>Shoulder Height</em>: Start at Shoulder Tip, follow armscye line down 4 inches
    and then drop down to Side Waist Point. Fig. 3. (Observe that this measurement
    does not fall over the bust. It aids in determining the size of dart which
    will be needed to control bust.)</p>
  <p>10. <em>Side Bodice Length</em>: From armscye down to Side Waist Point.
    Fig. 4. (When measuring individual figures, the armscye is located about
    1/2 inch below
    actual armpit. On heavier figures, it may be located an inch below, dependent
    upon how customer likes close fit of garments.)</p>
  <p>11. <em>Waist Measurement</em>: Side Waist Point to Side Waist Point on opposite
    side. Fig. 4. (This measurement varies in proportion to the similar measurement
    of the back half of the body, dependent upon posture of figure.)</p>
  <p>12. <em>Bust Point Height</em>: Taken from Bust Point to Waistline. Fig. 4. (Individual
    figures vary greatly in bust height. By determining the position of the bust
    in this measurement, you can plan length of dart.)</p>
  <p>13. <em>Bust Point Width</em>: Taken from Bust Point to Bust Point. Fig. 4. (Likewise,
    the width between breasts and also the shoulder blades varies in women. This
    measurement also aids in placing the point of dart in correct position in
    draft.)</p>
  <p>14. <em>Hip Measurement</em>: From Side Hip Point to Side Hip Point on opposite
    side. Fig. 4. (Side Hip Point is located 7 inches down from the waistline
    in all
    sizes of most factory made garments. However, when measuring an individual,
    it should be located in a position which is in line with the largest curve
    of the buttocks. This may vary from 6 to 10 inches from the waistline.)</p>
  <p> Observe, in the above diagrams, that relative measurements are taken of
    the back of the figure. As measurements number 7 and number 10 are common
    to both back and front, they may be noted in the back measurement chart at
    the same time they are recorded for the front.</p>
  <p>Measurement number 5, which measures the bodice width in front should fall
    in a horizontal line, directly across the highest point of the bust. The
    position of this measurement, therefore, will be dependent upon the height
    of the bust. However, when taking that same measurement of the back half
    of the body, it should be taken from armpit to armpit, as that area is the
    widest portion of the back.</p>
  <h3><em><a name="chart" id="chart"></a>Chart of Garment Measurements</em></h3>
  <p>In the following chart are listed the back and front bodice measurements
    for the size 16 and 14 model forms. Space has also been provided where you
    may insert the measurements which you will take from your model form in a
    problem a little further on.</p>
  <p>Do not forget that these measurements, although the most modern available,
    may not conform in every respect, to other similar sets of measurements you
    may some day use. Nor do they represent the measurements of a person who
    may wear a size 14 or 16 garment. Few people can wear garments which fit
    as closely as your muslins do on your model form. Therefore, we should expect
    that the person who finds a size 14 dress a comfortable fit may actually
    be slightly smaller in all of the horizontal measurements in this chart.</p>

  <h3><em>A Few Instructions Always Apply</em></h3>
  <p>Before attempting to make your draft, have all your tools in readiness.
    You will need your French curve, your square and a well-sharpened lead pencil.</p>
  <p>Your <em>Curve</em> will aid in describing the curves of the neckline and armscye.</p>
  <p>Your <em>Square</em> will be used to establish right angles and at the same time
    aid in measuring distances and drawing straight lines. Examine your square
    carefully. Notice that the inches are divided into halves, quarters and eighths
    on one side. Turn it over and on the long arm you will see the areas marked
    thirds, sixths etc. The areas that are marked thirds and sixths are the same&#8212;the
    larger numbered areas being each one third of an inch and the smaller areas,
    marked by shorter lines, being one-sixth of an inch. The still smaller areas,
    marked by still shorter lines are each one-twelfth inch. Study the similar
    markings which appear on the short arm of the square.</p>
  <p>Although most measurements taken involve the use of halves, quarters, or
    eighths of an inch, there are occasions, when some measurement is being divided
    or added to, that thirds or fifths may be required. If such a measurement
    might total four and two-thirds inches, the four inches would be measured
    off and then, by counting off two of the sections marked as thirds, the measurement
    would be recorded. Without these divisional points given to you on the square,
    it would be necessary to estimate that fractional amount and would lead to
    inaccuracies.</p>
  <p>Your <em>Pencil</em> should be sharpened to a long point. All lines must be drawn
    against the square with the pencil point held closely under the edge of the
    square and the eraser end tilted away from the square. Should the pencil
    be held vertically, the pencil line could stand away from the square fully
    a sixteenth of an inch.</p>
  <p>Precision in using your instruments will result in 
    precise work. There should be little excuse for carelessness on this point.</p>
  <h3><em><a name="frontbodice" id="frontbodice"></a>Drafting a Front Bodice Sloper</em></h3>
  <p>In the old days, tailors and dressmakers drafted patterns for all tailored
    clothes for each individual. Designs which involved the use of drapery were
    attached to a closely fitted lining which had been drafted to measurements.
    Then the pattern for the draped portion was created by working directly over
    this lining, attaching the drapery here and there.</p>
  <p>You have learned that, through the use of the modern free-hand slashing
    method, the basic sloper block can be the basis for countless designs. This
    modern block system is a combination of the two old-fashioned methods. The
    only occasion for the use of technical drafting nowadays is to produce the
    sloper. Tailors still employ drafting methods for men's clothing because
    such clothing is architectural in character. However, time may be when much
    of men's softer apparel may also be produced through the use of foundation
    slopers.</p>
  <p>You can follow the procedure on the following pages to produce a front bodice
    draft. Turn to the measurement chart and use the measurements for a size
    16. Before starting to work, check over each step carefully, mentally tracing
    each line shown in the diagram. You will notice that the measurements are
    used in the order that they were taken on the figure. When your draft is
    completed, it should closely resemble the diagram. When you have completed
    it, re-check each measurement for errors.</p>
  <p>NOTE: When the tailor measures one for a suit he calls out the measurements
    in a certain sequence while his assistant jots them down. He has <em>memorized</em>    this sequence, and also, most likely, the steps in drafting the patterns.
    He often chalks his draft directly on the fabric used for the suit. Naturally,
    this speeds his work; through ordered repetition he has become proficient
    and accurate; with careful study you may do the same.</p>

  <p>A&#8212;Point A is located 4 inches below the top edge of your paper and 1 inch
    inward from the right margin. Place a dot and label point A.</p>
  <p>A-B&#8212;Line A-B is equal in length to the amount of the <em>Center Bodice
      Length</em>    given in measurement chart. Starting with point A, measure
      downward that distance, keeping square parallel to right edge of the paper.
      Place dot and
    label point B. Connect A and B.</p>
  <p>B-2&#8212;This line equals <em>Full Bodice Length</em> measurement on the chart.
    Lay square along line A-B with short arm downward pointing to the left and
    the long
    arm extending upward, falling upon points B and A. From point B, measure
    off a distance equal to the <em>Full Bodice Length</em> and mark dot. Label
    dot 2. Draw the extending line A-2.</p>
  <p>Draw a guide line 15 inches long upon which points 3, 4 and 5 will be located.
    As this line must be at a right angle (squared) from the vertical line B-2,
    lay the square so that the short arm extends downward along the line B-2
    and the long arm extends across the paper towards the left.</p>
  <p>2-3&#8212;From point 2, measure off a distance equal to <em>one-half</em> your <em>Across
      Measurement</em>.
    Label that point 3.</p>
  <p>2-4&#8212;From point 2, measure off a distance equal to <em>one-half</em> the <em>Shoulder
    Point Width</em> and label that point 4.</p>
  <p>2-5&#8212;From point 2, measure off a distance equal to <em>one-half</em> the <em>Full
    Bodice Width</em> (bust measurement) and label that point 5.</p>
  <p><em>Square</em> guide lines downward from points 5, 4 and 3 as shown in diagram.</p>
  <p>B-6&#8212;From point B, measure a diagonal line equal to <em>Shoulder Pitch
      Measurement</em>    to
    a point somewhere on guide line extending downward from point 4. Label point
    6.</p>
  <p>6-7&#8212;From point 6, measure off a line equal to the <em>Shoulder Width Measurement</em>    to
    a point somewhere on line 2-3. (The corner at point 6 is not squared. The
    angle at this point will vary with measurements being used to produce
    any draft.) Label point 7.</p>
  <p>A-8&#8212;With the short arm of the square along line A-B, square a guide line
    6 inches long from point A. Do not label point 8 yet.</p>
  <p>7-8&#8212;From point 7, square a line downward from the line 6-7. This line
    should be extended to intersect with the horizontal guide line from A. Mark
    intersection
    point of these two guide lines 8</p>
  <p>6-C&#8212;From point 6, measure off a line 4 inches long to locate point 6 to
    fall somewhere on guide line 3. (This proportion is standard on all full
    size patterns.) Label point C.</p>
  <p> C-9&#8212;From point C, measure off a line to fall
      somewhere on guide line 5 equal to the <em>Shoulder Height Measurement</em> less
    the 4 inch amount just used in locating point C. Mark point 9.</p>
  <p>9-10&#8212;Starting from point 9, measure upward along line 5 a distance equal
    to the <em>Side Bodice Length measurement</em> given in the chart. Mark that
    point 10.</p>
  <p>10-D&#8212;With the long arm of the square extending downward from point 10
    and the short arm extending inward on your paper, square a line from line
    10-9
    which will intersect with guide line 4. Mark intersection point D. This aids
    in making armscye.</p>
  <p>B-E&#8212;From point B, measure upward along line B-A a distance equal to <em>Bust
    Point Height</em>. Label this point E.</p>
  <p>E-F&#8212;From point E, square a line from line B-E equal to <em>one-half</em> the <em>Bust
    Point Width</em> in your chart. Label point F and connect E and F.</p>
  <p>B-G&#8212;From point B, square a line from line E-B equal in length to line
    E-F less one-half inch. Label point G. Connect points G and B. Connect points
    G and F. (The line G-F represents the position of the basic waistline dart
    extending to the bust point. If lines G-B and E-F were identical, the dart
    would be truly vertical. This would make waistline appear large. When making
    individual drafts, the suitable angle for the dart should be noted. When
    measuring a model form, the proportion could be determined with the tapeline.)</p>
  <p>B-G-9&#8212;Draw a guide line connecting points G and 9. (Line B-G-9 represents
    a loose, unfitted waistline with the amount of dart yet undetermined. The
    dart must now be established to reduce the line B-G-9 down to actual front
    waist measurement.)</p>
  <p>Measure the line B-G-9. Jot that measurement down. Take <em>one-half</em> the <em>Waist
    Measurement</em> given in the chart and subtract it from the measurement of B-G-9.
    The difference gives you the amount to be put into dart.</p>

  <p>B-A-7-6-C-10-9-H-F-G-B</p>
  <p>Set this draft aside and proceed to complete the draft for the back section
    of the bodice from instructions appearing on the following pages.</p>
  <h3><em><a name="backbodice" id="backbodice"></a>Drafting a Back Bodice Sloper</em></h3>
  <p>Study this diagram of the back bodice draft with that of the front bodice
    and note the similarity and variations between the two. Study your model
    form. Note that the shoulder curve is more shallow than the bust and it spreads
    over a larger area. Hence the small dart at the shoulder neck point provides
    control for that curve. The long narrow dart is needed to provide fitting
    for the inward curve of the body from the shoulder blades to the back waistline.
    Also note that the underarm line H-10 in the draft provides for some shaping
    at that position.</p>
  <p>Also notice that the neckline is more shallow in the back than in the front
    draft. Study your model form and you will see that the neck tilts forward
    slightly which accounts for this difference.</p>
  <p>Notice that the distance between points 3 and 4 in the front is greater
    than in the back. If anything, the ideal figure has a slight hollow below
    the base of the neck and there is a very slight curve across the shoulder
    blades in the back. Note the difference in the <em>Across Measurements</em> given
    for the front and back in the chart.</p>
  <p>Observe that this draft is made in a reverse position to that made for the
    front. This assures using the measurements for the same half of the figure.
    Use size 16 measurements given in the chart.</p>

    and 1 inch inward from the left margin. Place dot at this point and label
    it A.</p>
  <p>A-B&#8212;Draw a line downward, parallel to the left margin of your paper, equal
    to <em>Center Bodice Length Measurement</em> on your chart. Label lower point
    B.</p>
  <p>B-2&#8212;This line equals the <em>Full Bodice Length Measurement</em>. Lay
    the square along line A-B. From point B, measure a line which extends through
    point
    A equal to the <em>Full Bodice Length Measurement</em>. Label point 2.</p>
  <p>2-3&#8212;Square a guide line 15 inches long at point 2, from line B-2. From
    point 2, measure off a distance on this guide line equal to <em>one-half</em> the <em>Across
    Measurement</em>. Label this point 3.</p>
  <p>2-4&#8212;From point 2, measure off a distance on this guide line equal to <em>one-half</em>    the <em>Shoulder

  <p>2-5&#8212;From point 2, measure off a distance on this guide line equal to <em>one-half</em>    the <em>Full
  Bodice Width Measurement</em>. Label this point 5.</p>
  <p>Square guide lines extending downward from points 3, 4 and 5.</p>
  <p>B-6&#8212;Starting at point B, measure a diagonal line which will fall somewhere
    on guide line 4 which is equal to the <em>Shoulder Pitch Measurement</em>.
    Label this point 6.</p>
  <p>6-7&#8212;From point 6, measure a line equal to the <em>Shoulder Width Measurement</em>    to
    a point located somewhere on the line 2-3. Label this point 7.</p>
  <p>A-8&#8212;From point A, measure a line equal to <em>one-half</em> the <em>Back
      Neck Measurement</em>, less 1/8 inch to a point somewhere on the line 2-3.
      Mark this point 8. The
    remaining distance between points 8 and 7 represents the amount to be used
    for the control dart for the curve of the shoulders. Because a curved line
    will be made to substitute for the guide neckline 8-A, the 1/8 inch is deducted
    to make allowance for that fact.</p>
  <p>6-C&#8212;From point 6, measure downward 4 inches to a point somewhere on guide
    line 3. Label this point C. Connect points 6 and C with a straight guide
    line.</p>
  <p>C-9&#8212;From point C, measure off a line equal to the <em>Shoulder Height
      Measurement</em>,
    less the 4 inches just used to locate point C, to a point somewhere on line
    5. Label 9.</p>
  <p>9-10&#8212;From point 9, measure upward along the guide line 5 a distance equal
    to the <em>Side Bodice Length</em>. Label this point 10.</p>
  <p>10-D&#8212;From point 10, square a line which will intersect with guide line
    4. Mark the intersection point D.</p>
  <p>B-E&#8212;From point B, measure upward on line B-A a distance equal to <em>Shoulder
    Blade Height</em>. (This is measurement number 12 which corresponds to bust
    height taken for front.) Mark point E.</p>
  <p>E-F&#8212;Square a line from point E equal to <em>one-half</em> the <em>Shoulder
      Blade Width</em>.
    (This is measurement number 13 which corresponds to bust point width in front.)
    Label point F.</p>
  <p>B-G&#8212;B-G is equal in length to E-F <em>less</em> one-half inch and is squared
    from line B-A at point B. Label point G. (This determines angle of back waistline
    dart. When an individual is being measured, this should be determined with
    the tapeline. The one-half inch is satisfactory for standard sizes.)</p>
  <p>G-9&#8212;From point G, draw a line to connect points G and 9. (Line B-G-9 represents
    the unfitted waistline. Some of this excess will be used in the dart, the
    remainder will be taken off at the side seam.)</p>
  <p>Measure line B-G-9. Jot that amount down. Subtract <em>one-half</em> the
    <em>Back Waist Measurement</em> from this amount. The difference represents the amount
    which
    must be thrown into a dart and taken off the side seam.</p>
  <p>Divide this difference in half. (Should minute fractions be involved, you
    can take a strip of paper equal to the difference and fold it in half as
    a measuring agent.)</p>
  <p>9-H&#8212;From point 9, measure off a distance on the line B-G-9 equal to one-half
    the strip of paper. Label that point H.</p>
  <p>H-10&#8212;Draw a connecting line between points H and 10.</p>
  <p>G-I&#8212;From point G, measure to the right a distance equal to the remaining
    unused portion of the difference. Label point I.</p>
  <p>F-G&#8212;Connect points F and G.</p>
  <p>F-I&#8212;Connect points F and I.</p>
  <p>Check the length of lines F-G and F-I to be sure they are of equal length.
    Make the required correction as shown by dotted line. </p>
  <p>Because the side bodice length measurement was used to establish point 10
    and the new side seam H-10 was later established, it is important to check
    the line H-10 to make sure it equals the original side bodice length measurement.
    Such correction should be made at point H. (As the side seam will meet the
    side seam of the bodice front, it must be identical in length.)</p>
  <p>J&#8212;Locate this point 3 1/2 inches downward from point 8 in a position which
    is parallel to the center back line A-B. Label point J.</p>
  <p> J-8&#8212;Connect points J and 8.</p>
  <p> J-7&#8212;Connect points J and 7.</p>
  <p>With the aid of the curve as shown in accompanying diagram, complete the
    back neckline and the armscye of the draft. Curve may have to be adjusted
    to complete armscye. It is merely a <em>guide</em>.</p>
  <p> With blue pencil, trace around your finished draft as follows:</p>

  <p>Check your draft carefully and check it against the bodice front draft at
    the shoulder seams and side seams. It should resemble the diagram in general
    proportions.</p>
  <p>With this practice in the use of measurements, you are ready to measure
    your model form, record the measurements in the space provided in the chart
    and then use them to produce the draft and the muslin proof.</p>
  <p>When drafts for the front and back bodices are finished, check them carefully.
    Allow seams at shoulder seam, underarm, waistline and the center back.</p>
  <p>If the muslin doesn't show a good fit, it will be either an error in taking
    the measurements or in the use of them.</p>
  <p>When a satisfactory muslin has been produced, cut away seam allowances on
    the draft and make front and back cardboard slopers. They will supplement
    those which you have been using.</p>
  <p>It is quite possible for two individuals to measure up the same model, produce
    drafts for well fitting muslins and still not produce drafts which are identical.
    These are &quot;human&quot; variations but they should not exceed one sixteenth
    of an inch. Anything more than that would show up in the fit of the muslins.</p>
  <h3><em>Individual Measurements</em></h3>
  <p>Because many readers may wish to put this portion of their training into
    immediate use, these instructions are being given at this time.</p>
  <p>There are three methods which might be used for making individual slopers,
    namely:</p>
  <p>1. Altering a muslin made from a standard size draft to fit the individual
    and then making a card board sloper from this corrected muslin.</p>
  <p>2. Taking measurements of the individual and making a draft from these measurements
    and testing results with a muslin proof.</p>
  <p>3.	Using muslin and draping a basic block directly upon the individual.</p>
  <p>There are disadvantages as well as advantages to each method. Professional
    designers report a variation of opinions and generally agree that,
    with practice and care, the second method is preferred.</p>
  <p>METHOD 1: is quicker when the customer doesn't vary much from standard dimensions.
    By using the perfectly proportioned pattern, some defects are lessened in
    importance and are better left unaltered.</p>
  <p>METHOD 2: is the most direct and scientific approach to the problem. It
    includes the faults in posture as well as measurements. Care must be taken,
    though, in placing the points of measurements to give the best line to the
    construction seams. When using this method in business, many students draft
    directly upon muslin, with blue pencil.</p>
  <p>METHOD 3: is offered as a possible substitute for method 2. Designers agree
    that it requires a good &quot;eye&quot; for line and a good &quot;hand&quot; for
    handling cloth and that errors can easily be made. It offers a good opportunity,
    however, for distribution of the basic control according to the curves of
    the figure. People who have done draping may find it a convenient method.</p>
  <p>Because this text is primarily devoted to making drafts from measurements,
    such instructions will be applied to the making of personal slopers. The
    other two methods involve the training in alterations and draping. Method
    1 involves alterations described on <a href="#69">page 69</a>. Method 3 is diagramed on <a href="mpd-01.html#4">page
    4</a>.</p>
  <p>Students are demonstrating how successfully personal drafts may be made
    from individual measurements by taking great care in the placement of measurement
    points. As the human figure is not rigid, like the dress form, curves are
    intensely defined and not modified. Allowances for this fact should be made
    when taking measurements.</p>
  <p>Make sure that the customer stands with weight distributed evenly on both
    feet. When being measured or fitted, many people have a tendency to straighten
    up more than usual, or lift the shoulders into a tense position. Watch to
    see that she maintains a relaxed, normal posture through her shoulders.</p>
  <p>Use colored chalk for marking the points. It will rub off easily. Tie a
    tape around the waist to place the waistline, which will vary with different
    postures.</p>
  <p><em>Keep this in mind:</em> Take measurements number 1 in front and back <em>loosely</em>.
    This will make allowance for the indentation between breasts and shoulder
    blades.</p>

      these points of measurement with diagrams:</em></p>
  <p>A&#8212;Should be placed in the hollow at the base of the neck in front and
    just above the bone in the back of the neck.</p>
  <p>B&#8212;Should fall in a direct vertical line with A.</p>
  <p>C&#8212;Should be placed slightly less than halfway on the normal neck silhouette.
    Observe the position on your model form.</p>
  <p>D&#8212;This point should be placed at the point where the wrinkle appears when
    the customer raises her arm.</p>
  <p>E&#8212;Should be placed about 1 inch below the armpit and slightly forward.</p>
  <p>F&#8212;Should fall directly in line with point E except in heavy figures. Charts
    on next page will explain this point.</p>
  <p> G&#8212;Points the actual bust point.</p>
  <p>H&#8212;Divides the silhouette of the figure in half at the largest point of
    the hip.</p>
  <p>If you will connect these points with lines drawn into your figures, you
    will observe the position of the seams which would result from the proper
    placing of these points.</p>

  <p>It is suggested that you try and find some willing subjects for practice
    in taking individual measurements and making personal drafts. If you do not
    find that convenient, you can pad up your model form to have a heavier bust,
    set lower on the figure and take measurements off that. Leave the pads in
    place so that you may judge your results.</p>
  <p>Before attempting to work out these practice problems, it would be advisable
    for you to study the comparison figure charts on the following page.</p>
  <p>Observe shifting of points C, F and H with change of posture and flesh contours.</p>
  <p>Notice that side seam lines E-F-H should change to conform to changing contours
    caused by flesh deposits on the heavier, mature figure. If side seam on Mrs.
    Heavy were to be made vertical as it was for Mrs. Slim, it would fail to
    divide her silhouette vertically and would reveal her bad figure lines.</p>
  <p><em><strong><a href="illust/02-68.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',506,704);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/02-68-t.jpg" alt="Changes to sloper" width="500" height="355" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em></p>
  <p class="clear">The following diagrams reveal the changes which take place for the four
    type figures illustrated on the previous page. Note changes in size and length
    of bust darts with the increasing size of waistline. Note shape of the armscye
    in larger sizes to accommodate fullness under the arm. In the back sloper,
    the shoulder dart widens to accommodate greater curve in the shoulder area.
    The shoulders slope more in the mature figures also and the waistline dart
    shortens.</p>
  <p>The muslin fitting of the individual draft is necessary for the same reason
    that it is when measuring a dress form. It reveals inaccuracies in taking
    measurements and permits minor corrections which may develop because of posture.
    It also gives the designer an opportunity to correct the position of basic
    construction seams, or darts, to overcome faulty appearance due to bad proportions
    of the individual.</p>
  <p>If the muslin does not fit in several places, then you should retake the
    measurements and make a new attempt. If there is some single point which
    is unsatisfactory, an adjustment may be made to make the muslin fit and then
    the paper pattern may be corrected in an identical manner, thereby saving
    the necessity of repeating the procedure on the same subject.</p>
  <p>Your work will improve with each new person you measure. It is a matter
    of practice and discovery of errors. Following are given a few defects which
    have appeared in classroom projects, each one of which requires but a simple
    adjustment to make the muslin a correct fit. On the left side of the drawing
    the error is shown and the right side of the drawing shows the method used
    to remedy the fault.</p>

  <p>FIG. 4&#8212;Wrinkles at front of arm. Cut out armscye slightly. Shapes of armscyes
    must vary with muscular development around armpits of individuals.</p>
  <p>FIG. 5&#8212;Excessive gaping at lower armscye. Pinch tiny diagonal dart to
    point of bust. Leave corrective dart pinned in as explained for Fig. 3. <em>Do
    not overfit here!</em> It is quite possible to pinch out too much at this
    point which will result in an ugly depression in garment when sleeve has
    been set in.
    Observe that a model form is so designed as to fill in the natural depression
    here. For that reason, the muslin on the model form may be fitted <em>closely</em>    at
    this point.</p>
  <p>FIG. 6&#8212;Excessive binding at front armscye. Activity in certain sports
    will develop extra muscle at this point. Make slash from armscye to bust
    point
    at the point where muslin binds. Permit the muslin to spread to relieve condition.
    Insert a small patch of muslin behind the slash and pin into position. This
    enlarges armscye exactly where needed. When muslin is flattened upon the
    table this adjustment will prove to reduce the amount of waistline control
    slightly as a result.</p>
  <p>NOTE: This is a common adjustment when making boxy-type coats or heavily
    padded shoulders. It eliminates the &quot;break&quot; which may result from
    excessively close fitting at the front of the armscye in such silhouettes.
    When such an adjustment has been made, the sleeve cap may be broadened slightly
    at a relative position.</p>
  <p><em><strong><a href="illust/02-69-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',194,673);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/02-69-b-t.jpg" alt="Figures 7 through 11" width="500" height="133" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em></p>
  <p class="clear">FIGS. 7 and 8&#8212;Muslin seems to be too long throughout. Do not follow the
    impulse to pull it down and cut it off at the waistline! Place the bustline
    of the muslin in the correct position on the figure and then take a small
    tuck straight across the chest area, if it seems to bulge with extra length
    there. Or a tuck taken in the area below the bust may make the proper adjustment.</p>
  <p>If the customer stands too rigid and erect when measurements are taken,
    and then slumps into her true posture during the test fitting, the garment
    frequently needs such an adjustment across the chest. If the garment is too
    short in one of these areas, lengthen the pattern by slashing straight across
    it and setting in a piece of muslin wide enough to make the alteration. These
    alterations are common to both front and back.</p>
  <p>FIG. 9&#8212;Armscye gaps in shoulder area. Pinch corrective dart in and then
    shift it into the basic shoulder dart when muslin is on the table. This will
    make a larger size shoulder dart.</p>
  <p>FIG. 10&#8212;Armscye gaps near point of waist dart. Pinch in diagonal dart
    to point of waistline dart and shift this corrective dart into waistline
    dart

  <p>FIG. 11&#8212;Droopiness under the arm. Pinch in corrective dart in the back
    portion only and shift corrective dart into the basic waistline dart as in
    Fig. 3.
    This is an important fitting area. Smart, clean lines under the arm give
    the wearer a &quot;trim&quot; fit.</p>
  <p>Your experience in the fitting of muslins to your model form should have
    given you an appreciation of a good fit. Muslin proofs for personal blocks
    should fit smoothly, but not skin tight. Some designers take the number 5
    measurement on their customer with a tight tapeline and then add 1 inch for
    ease.</p>
  <p>If you will mentally divide your bodice down the center front and horizontally
    through the bust, you can analyze the true seat of the trouble, if there
    is any. Any faults which appear <em>above</em> the bust line should be remedied without
    disturbing the area <em>below</em> the bust line.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><em><a name="easefront" id="easefront"></a><strong><a href="illust/02-70.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',267,178);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/02-70-t.jpg" alt="Adding east in front bodice" width="128" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>Adding Ease in Front Bodice</em></h3>
  <p>When a muslin is fitted over a standard size model form, it is fitted closely.
    This is because it is assumed that the individual who purchases the garment
    will buy the size which provides sufficient room to provide an &quot;easy&quot; fit.
    When using a basic sloper which has been closely fitted to an individual,
    some designers find it convenient to have a supplementary bodice sloper which
    has an extra amount of room in the front. This is used when making blouses
    or other garments which require a softer fit around the bust. The accompanying
    diagram shows how this case may be added. The dotted lines must be made to
    equal the original dart length in the sloper. Note the slight corrections
    required at the shoulder and waistline. Such a pattern would be reserved
    for special use when making certain garments. It should be labeled to show
    the amount of added ease provided.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><em><strong><a name="controlback" id="controlback"></a><a href="illust/02-71-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',298,162);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/02-71-a-t.jpg" alt="Back sloper" width="102" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em>THE BACK SLOPER</h3>
  <h3><em>Analysis for Need of Control</em></h3>
  <p>In the foregoing problems you studied the need for a control to be provided
    in the front bodice pattern. By drafting the back sloper you have seen the
    need for providing similar control for the curves which appear in that portion
    of the body.</p>
  <p>The dart placed at the shoulder neck point in this pattern may be moved
    to the shoulder seam or the back neckline. The first and second positions
    are preferred for garments designed for younger women. The third is best
    suited to the mature woman's garments because, as women grow older, the highest
    point of the shoulder curve becomes more pronounced in the center back.</p>
  <p>Notice that the fabric grain is placed on a true horizontal in the shoulder
    curve area. This insures strength where the strain on the garment is the
    greatest. If a garment is properly cut, the back may be very closely fitted
    without restraining movement of the arms. Garments designed for active sports
    wear are usually provided with extra means of expansion, such as pleats or
    fullness. After the golf swing, the garment falls back into position and
    a trim appearance is maintained.</p>
  <p>From this point on, you will notice that the problems merely show a repeated
    use of some principle which you have previously studied. There are only a
    few basic principles common to pattern making. The student soon learns to
    use these same principles in many different ways.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><em><a name="faults" id="faults"></a><a name="controlback" id="controlback"></a><strong><a href="illust/02-71-b-t.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',195,221);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/02-71-b-t.jpg" alt="Control at shoulder" width="201" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>Shifting Control from Shoulder Neck Point </em></h3>
  <h3><a name="shiftingdarts" id="shiftingdarts"></a><em>1&#8212;To Center of Shoulder </em></h3>
  <p>Trace around original back bodice sloper on
    light weight paper to start this new pattern. Dotted lines show method for
    shifting the original control into the new position.</p>
  <p>Before making any corrections in shoulder seam, establish position of left
    side of new dart parallel to center back. Make the width of new dart same
    as B-C. Make left edge of dart same length as right edge. Then connect it
    with point B. Area below point C is discarded in new pattern and original
    dart tracing is ignored. As new shoulder control dart is opening on an angle
    seam, it should be completed as diagramed in first bodice front problem.</p>
  <p>Seams should be added to the pattern and a muslin test made. When new dart
    has been pinned into position, shoulder seam width should be identical with
    C-D in the sloper. After testing and approving results on a model form, seam
    allowance can be cut away from pattern and a cardboard sloper made in usual
    manner.</p>
  <p>Remember that a dart produces a line in a garment. Therefore, to produce
    harmony in the back bodice, the position of the shoulder dart should continue
    the line of the waistline darts</p>
  <p>If occasion demands, any such single dart may be substituted by using gathers,
    multiple darts, etc. Method would be identical with that diagramed for bodice
    front darts.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><em><strong><a href="illust/02-72-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',303,332);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/02-72-a-t.jpg" alt="Control at back of neck" width="193" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>2&#8212;To Two Darts at Back of Neck</em></h3>
  <p>In some cases, a bodice is being designed in such a manner as to prevent
    the placing of the dart at the shoulder seam or shoulder neck. In such instances
    it must be shifted over to the center back neckline. This is particularly
    true when the shoulder seam has been moved as in the case of shirt waist
    blouses, diagramed later in this text.</p>
  <p>The angle of the dart may vary as desired. If it is kept parallel to the
    center back, it will give the wearer a more erect appearance. If the points
    of the darts are spread apart too far, it may give the wearer the appearance
    of being round-shouldered. If the woman has a broad, thick neck, spreading
    the points slightly will make her neck appear more slender.</p>
  <p>When the dotted line from A to C has been drawn, the final position of the
    dart is determined with relation to the center back. The new neckline dart
    should equal the distance from B to C. By folding the pattern paper over
    to close the new neckline dart, you can use your tracing wheel to complete
    the shape of the normal neckline. When the paper has been flattened, the
    dart opening has been automatically completed and seam allowance is then
    added.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><em><strong><a href="illust/02-72-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',317,350);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/02-72-b-t.jpg" alt="Control in three darts" width="193" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>3&#8212;To Multiple Darts at Back of Neck</em></h3>
  <p>When a dress is to close at the center back with loops and buttons or a
    zipper, a portion of the shoulder control may be shifted to the center back
    and the remainder either left at the shoulder neck point, or placed in the
    neckline.</p>
  <p>The dart labeled A represents one-third of B-C. This may be used as a simple
    dart as shown in the sketch, or it may be cut away and a facing made which
    will permit the use of loops. The second dart would be completed in the manner
    given in previous problem.</p>
  <p>The entire control <em>might</em> be shifted to the center back, but, as you learned
    when studying the vertical center front control in the front bodice, it would
    tend to sag in the center back unless the basic control dart was originally
    very shallow.</p>
  <p>For the sake of convenience, designers sometimes keep several back bodice
    slopers on hand, each one of which provides the shoulder control in a different
    position. You should recognize the importance of moving this functional dart
    to add a feeling of unity to the back of the most simple garment, as occasion
    may offer.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><em><a name="shiftingyoke" id="shiftingyoke"></a><strong><a href="illust/02-73-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',354,740);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/02-73-a-t.jpg" alt="Shifting control into yoke seam" width="377" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>Shifting Control
    into Yoke Seam</em></h3>
  <p>Basic shoulder darts may be shifted into yoke seams in the back, if the
    yoke line falls over the point of the shoulder dart. Otherwise, the control
    must be provided through gathers below a shallow yoke or at the neckline
    in the deeper yoke.</p>
  <p>Notice the &quot;flat&quot; method for changing the single waistline dart
    into three small darts. As long as the position of the control is unchanged,
    this method may be used in any similar instance in any section of a pattern.
    The horizontal guide line shows the length of the new darts and the lines
    are drawn on either side of the original dart. By slashing up to the point
    the sections may be separated to form three darts.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><strong><a href="illust/02-73-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',314,691);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/02-73-b-t.jpg" alt="Shifting control into yoke seam" width="399" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em>NOTE: Because the points of the shoulder and waistline darts do not meet,
    they cannot be combined into one dart without adding extra width across back
    of garment. When extra fullness is being added this could be done. Use caution
    when adding gathers across the back&#8212;it may make the wearer appear round-shouldered</p>

  <p>To the person who has not studied the fundamentals of pattern making, many
    designs for garments may appear to be complicated and difficult. Usually,
    those designs employ the principle of moving or eliminating fundamental seams
    in certain portions of a garment for the sake of design interest.</p>
  <p>When you have experimented with several such problems, you will find the
    procedure quite simple and the opportunity for interesting designs almost
    limitless. It is important that you observe what happens to the grain of
    the fabric in such cases. By using your ruler and blue pencil, you can mark
    your muslin to appear to be a striped fabric. When the muslin proof is on
    the figure, the results become quite obvious to you. In the following problems,
    if you will do this, you may learn some very interesting facts which will
    help you in cutting garments involving this principle. This problem eliminates
    the basic shoulder seam, making the yoke and back into one piece.</p>
  <p><em>Read Each Step Carefully</em></p>
  <p><strong>1.	Trace around your front bodice sloper which has the underarm control.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>2. Place the shoulder seam of the back sloper against the shoulder seam
    of your front bodice, tracing as shown in Fig. 2. See drawing.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>3. Cut out the two sections, but do not cut at the shoulder line. Fold in
    underarm dart temporarily and place over model form. Sketch in desired yoke
    design.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>4. Remove pattern and flatten upon table. Prepare for shifting underarm
    control to waistline dart tucks. Mark notches in yoke line. Cut back and
    front apart on yoke line. See Fig. 3</strong></p>
  <p><strong>5. Make final pattern for each section. Trace the original shoulder
      seam with tracing wheel so that notches can be made in final pattern, Fig.
      4, to
    aid in setting in sleeve and the collar as you would do in making a complete
    garment</strong></p>
  <p><strong>6. Lay out the pattern on your muslin so the center back and center front
    fall on fold. Assemble sections, leaving left underarm seam open to permit
    testing muslin on your model form. Observe the results of the striped fabric,
    showing the yoke appearing on the bias in the front.</strong></p>
  <p>NOTE: Through experiment on your part, you can learn ways of developing
    interesting designs for garments from fabrics having checks and stripes.
    This is called &quot;fabric manipulation&quot; and is an inexpensive way
    to get smart effects. It is used frequently by designers. </p>
  <h3><a name="75" id="75"></a>PRACTICE PROBLEMS</h3>
  <h3><em><a name="variations" id="variations"></a>Variations of Designs for Backs</em></h3>
  <p><em><strong><a href="illust/02-75-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',278,735);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/02-75-a-t.jpg" alt="Variations of design for backs" width="500" height="180" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em></p>
  <p class="clear">Yokes in active sports garments should be shallow to insure the extra ease
    through the middle of the armscye. These designs show deep yokes which retain
    the shoulder control. Change the proportions and correct them to absorb the
    shoulder dart and insure freedom of action in the armscye.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><strong><a href="illust/02-75-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',303,714);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/02-75-b-t.jpg" alt="Variations of design for backs" width="490" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em></p>
  <p class="clear"> The above sketches
      show the use of three pattern cutting principles: Control at shoulder
    has been shifted into yoke seam. Bodice portion is slashed and spread to
    provide
      material for a pleat. The normal waistline dart has been retained but gathers
      have been substituted to fall at either side, beside the pleat, which is
      purely decorative.</p>
  <p>When using this simulated yoke in the back (<a href="mpd-01.html#simulatedyoke">see page 40</a>), it is usually
    a good plan to locate the horizontal line at a level slightly higher than
    that used for the front bodice. If the line is placed too low, it will give
    the wearer an unpleasingly thick appearance just below the shoulder blade.
    This is also true when designing full yokes.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><em><a name="eliminate" id="eliminate"></a><strong><a href="illust/02-76.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',355,737);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/02-76-t.jpg" alt="Eliminating waistline control" width="428" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>Eliminating Waistline Control</em></h3>
  <p>In this problem, you will learn the most satisfactory method for eliminating
    the waistline dart in the back of the bodice. This is only possible because
    of the shape of the curve which is being fitted. It would not prove satisfactory
    for the bust curve.</p>
  <p>When designing low-cut evening gowns, where the basic dart would appear
    to be too obvious, this adjustment is made before the making of the pattern
    for the design. Likewise, this principle is used for some basque fitted waists.</p>
  <p>Although it does eliminate the functional dart, seemingly, it merely shifts
    the work done by the dart to the waistline seam and the underarm seam. Garments
    so fitted are not as comfortable, and, due to the extra fitting which is
    shifted to the side seam, the grain of the fabric is changed and the garment
    will not hold its shape as well. For this reason, most garments appearing
    in the shops today provide a basic waistline control or provide seams for
    that purpose.</p>
  <p><em>Read Each Step Carefully</em></p>
  <p><strong>1.	Make construction pattern from back sloper.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>2. Locate point B one inch from underarm seam point. (Fig. 2.) Draw line
    A-B.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>3. Draw preliminary line E-B through point C, making it equal in length
    to line A-B.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>4.	Draw in preliminary line E-D</strong></p>
  <p><strong>5. Due to the equalizing of the two lines A-B and E-B, to make the two sides
    of equal length, we now find that the distance from A to E, or the width
    of the dart is slightly less than the basic dart on our sloper shown as A-C
    in Fig. 2.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>6. In order to be sure that the waistline of our pattern will be exactly
    the same size of our sloper, we must shift the line E-B until we have made
    the distance from E to D identical with C to D. Draw this final line.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>7. Fold in this new dart. Because it extends to an outer edge on
      the pattern it can be folded in but the pattern will remain flat. Observe
      that you now
    have a slight curve in the waistline seam and the remaining portion of the
    fitting, appears to have been shifted to the underarm seam. The armscye curve
    straightens slightly.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>8.	Complete final pattern and muslin and test over your model form.</strong></p>
  <p class="clear"><em><strong><a href="illust/02-77.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',744,554);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/02-77-t.jpg" alt="Additional practice problems for bodices" width="369" height="500" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em>NOTE: An old method used was to attempt to take an amount equal to the dart
    off the side seam. Although used for many years, it resulted in a very uncomfortable
    garment. This new method has been developed which changes shape of armscye,
    and has proven to be more satisfactory in the finished garment.</p>
  <h3><em><a name="practice" id="practice"></a>Additional Practice Problems for Bodices</em></h3>
  <p>Shown above are illustrations of garments which are so designed as to employ
    the principle of shifting basic sloper seams for the sake of further interest
    in design. Study the diagrams carefully and then produce your patterns accordingly.
    Note that in Fig. 1, the small amount of control which remains after the
    position of the new seam has been established is shifted. Then the lines
    indicating the position for slashes which produce the balanced fullness are
    added.</p>
  <p>The strap extending around to the back of the neck shown in Fig. 3 is first
    taken from the back bodice construction pattern. In the final pattern, it
    is moved over to the front to make a continuous strap cut in one piece with
    the front. Note the method used to eliminate the normal underarm seam in
  Fig. 6.</p>

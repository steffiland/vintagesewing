<p class="clear"><a name="importance" id="importance"></a><em><a href="illust/08-167.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',377,314);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/08-167-t.jpg" alt="Skirt definitions" width="144" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>The methods used for cutting skirts are being presented at this point, because
  after having studied cutting principles applying to other portions of the garment,
  you will have acquired a deep appreciation of the artistry required to produce
a pattern for a well hung skirt.</p>
<p>The skirt is the portion of the garment which is essentially physical in character.
  It covers the hips and limbs of the wearer. Emphasis placed upon certain areas
  will give the woman a sexy appearance. In some cases, this might be deliberate
  intent on the part of the designer, but when it has been done unintentionally,
  and the garment is worn by the wrong type of woman, the results are disappointing.</p>
<p>The garment which has a flattering skirt will be the favorite in any woman's
  wardrobe. Unfortunately, many women's figures are such that there is a great
  need for flattering the hips and limbs and a well designed skirt will sell
  the rest of the garment to the customer. Every woman secretly yearns for beauty
  of limb more than beauty of face. Hence, if you would become known for your
  talent as a designer, learn to cut shapely, flattering skirts and your future
  will be assured!</p>
<p>The silhouette and the length of the skirt is a vital point in changing styles.
  It has been widely said that the skirt will &quot;date&quot; the garment. It
  must be proportioned to suit the size of the wearer and the height of the hemline.
  It must be designed as a unit. It is therefore a dangerous procedure to merely
  shorten a skirt three inches in an attempt to bring a dress into current style.</p>
<p><a name="vocab" id="vocab"></a>A few professional terms describe skirt features:</p>
<p>1. <em>Sweep</em>: is used to describe the width at the hemline.</p>
<p>2. <em>Movement</em>: refers to the fullness or the bulk of the silhouette.</p>
<p>3. <em>Break</em>: is the point where the fitted area of the skirt breaks away from
  the body into movement.</p>
<p>Because the skirt is suspended from the waistline and falls naturally from
  some given point, a well hung skirt is the result of the proper placing of
  the grain of the fabric. If this is not carefully planned, it may sag or pucker
  at the seams or twist on the body. When the pattern is being designed, the
  texture of the fabric must be taken into consideration in planning the degree
  of movement and sweep. A skirt designed to be used for a tweed fabric would
  appear skimpy when used for light weight silk or chiffon.</p>
<p>When one says, &quot;The skirt has good lines,&quot; he means to say that
  it has a pleasingly balanced silhouette, the break being well placed for the
  length of the skirt and the amount of movement. The seams within that silhouette
  are also pleasingly spaced to create the impression of a perfectly proportioned
  woman. It must be equally attractive whether the figure is standing or in motion.
  A well fitted skirt will not cause wrinkles to appear through excessive fitting
  in any one area. The flattering skirt will veil the bad proportions of the
  wearer and reveal the good ones to a modest degree. It will be smoothly fitted,
  but it will at no time appear to hamper freedom of movement.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><a href="illust/08-168.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',457,181);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/08-168-t.jpg" alt="Figure 1" width="74" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>How to Take Measurements Correctly</em></h3>
<p>The measurements needed to draft a skirt sloper would normally be recorded
  at the time measurements would be taken for the bodice and sleeves. As some
  of the bodice measurements are common to the skirt draft, turn back to your
  basic measurements to ascertain the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Number 11. <em>Front Waistline Measurement </em></li>
  <li>Number 11. <em>Back Waistline Measurement</em>  </li>
  <li>Number 13. <em>Shoulder Blade Width</em> (back only) </li>
  <li>Number 14. <em>Front Hip Measurement</em>  </li>
  <li>Number 14. <em>Back Hip Measurement</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Take these length measurements from waistline tape to floor:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Front Center Skirt Length Measurement</em></li>
  <li><em>Side Skirt Measurement</em></li>
  <li><em>Back Center Skirt Measurement</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The method used for taking these last three length measurements is shown in
  Fig. 1. On the normal size 14 slopers used in manufacturing plants usually
  the back length is made one half inch longer than the front length measurement.
  It is assumed that the posture is ideal which provides for a true horizontal
  waistline and the difference in length is due to the additional length caused
  by the curve at the back hips. The side length measurement is made equal to
  the back length measurement. The front section of the skirt would be curved
  downward at the waistline towards the center front to a point one half inch
  downward.</p>
<p>These proportions would vary in patterns used for larger size garments. Manufacturers
  of specially sized &quot;stouts&quot; use special slopers which provide for
  abnormal deposits of flesh and imperfect posture. It is interesting to know
  that most irregular size, stout women would not have abnormal flesh distribution
  if good posture had been maintained!</p>
<p>The vertical skirt length measurement to the floor is a permanent record.
  As the fashion changes the heights of the skirt hems change. It is also convenient
  to have the full length measurement in case one has occasion to cut a full
  length garment. Naturally, when fitting slopers to individuals, the measurements
  would be taken directly from the individual and the proportions might differ
  somewhat from the standard figure of that height.</p>
<p>You will recall, when you were experimenting with various hip length bodice
  patterns, you found that the jacket which had a center back seam, with accompanying
  darts, produced a close fitting jacket. When the center back seam was eliminated
  for a fold of the fabric, a semi-fitted garment resulted. This skirt pattern
  is intended to be worn separately or as the <em>attached</em> skirt to a bodice for
  a dress. It is not an extension of the hip-length bodice pattern. Such an extension
  would be used to produce a <em>vertically fitted garment</em> having no waistline. Such
  designs are presented later in this text. The simple, basic skirt sloper should
  be cut on the fold at the front and back centers and the back darts provide
  the control of the shaping through the back hip area. The shaped side seams
  aid in fitting the side hip area.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><a name="simple" id="simple"></a><a href="illust/08-169-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',385,229);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/08-169-a-t.jpg" alt="Figure 2" width="100" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>Drafting the Two-Pieced Skirt Sloper</em></h3>
<p>Fig. 2 illustrates the simple skirt sloper which forms the basis for a wide
  variety of dress and suit skirts. It is seldom used as a skirt pattern in this
  simple form. When it is, usually extra inverted pleats are added in at least
  one side seam to provide ample walking room.</p>
<p>Your finished draft will provide a <em>minimum</em> of walking room needed for a slender
  figure. Larger size women need walking room distributed around the skirt and
  therefore this style would not be suitable for such individuals as it would
  mean adding all the required walking room at the two <em>side</em> seams and that would
  result in an ugly silhouette.</p>
<p>The basic hip darts extending from the waistline to the hip in the back are
  basic control darts. Note that they are slightly tilted outward at the hip.
  This conforms to the natural contour of the feminine body. Further comment
  will be made as to the possibilities of changing the position of the darts
  when designing for certain proportioned individuals. These darts are needed
  to give a smooth fit to the back hips when a skirt has a straight silhouette.
  They <em>control</em> the fabric over the <em>back</em> hips.</p>
<p class="clear"><em><a href="illust/08-169-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',442,324);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/08-169-b-t.jpg" alt="Figure 3" width="126" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="169" id="169"></a>In Fig. 3 on this page, note that the side seams provide the fitting for the
  <em>side</em> hip curve. Also note that the side seam of the front section is more curved
  than the back. This is caused by the fact that the ideal figure has a straight
  silhouette at the front and the curve of the hip starts at each side. Certain
  types of figures require some control in the front. In later lessons you will
  observe how the curve of the side seam may be lessened when darts are used.</p>
<p><em>Read Each Step Carefully</em></p>
<p class="clear"><em><a href="illust/08-170.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',430,290);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/08-170-t.jpg" alt="Drafting skirt sloper" width="115" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>All measurements given here are for an average size 14 figure. See chart on
  <a href="mpd-02.html#measurements">page 59</a>.</em></p>
<p>A-B&#8212;Draw the vertical line A-B equal in length to <em>Back Skirt Length</em>.
  (Determined by subtracting height of desired hemline from full length measurement.)</p>
<p>A-C&#8212;From point A, on line A-B measure downward a distance equal to <em>Hip
    Depth</em>.
  (In standard sizes placed at seven inches but with individuals, it may vary
  from 6 to 10 inches.) Label point C.</p>
<p>B-D&#8212;From the line A-B, square a line to the right, equal to one half the <em>Back
  Hip Measurement</em>. Label point D.</p>
<p>D-E&#8212;Extend the line B-D an amount equal to one half <em>Front Hip Measurement</em>.
  Label E.</p>
<p>E-F&#8212;From the line B-E, square a line upward which is equal to line A-B.
  Label F.</p>
<p>A-F&#8212;Connect points A and F with a straight line. Line A-F must equal B-E.</p>
<p>F-G&#8212;This line equals the line A-C. Connect points G and C.</p>
<p>D-H-I&#8212;Square a line upward from point D to intersect the line C-G. Mark
  point of intersection H. Extend this line to intersect with line A-F. Label
  point
  I.</p>
<p>F-J&#8212;The area between points F and J equals the difference between the <em>Center
  Front Skirt Measurement</em> and the <em>Center Back Skirt Measurement</em>.
  Label point J. (Occasionally, in certain individuals, these measurements are
  the same.
  In such cases, eliminate location of point J.)</p>
<p>J-K&#8212;From point J, measure off a distance on the line F-I equal to half the
  <em>Front Waist Measurement</em>. Label point K. With the aid of your curve
  draw lines J-K and K-H.</p>
<p>A-L&#8212;From point A, on line A-I, measure off a distance equal to half <em>Back
  Shoulder Blade Width</em> less one-half inch. Label L.</p>
<p>C-M&#8212;From point C, measure off distance on the line C-H equal to the line
  A-L plus one inch.</p>
<p>Subtract half <em>Back Waist Measurement</em> from the length of line A-L.
  Cut small strip of paper equal to this difference. Fold strip into three equal
  parts.</p>
<p>L-N&#8212;From point L on line L-I, measure off a distance equal to two-thirds
  of the strip of paper and label point N. Connect points L and N with point
  M to
  form back hip dart.</p>
<p>I-O&#8212;From point I on line I-N, measure off a distance equal to the remaining
  unused third of strip of paper. Label point O. Use curve to connect points
  O and H.</p>
<p>D-P&#8212;From point D on the line D-B, measure off one and one-half inches and
  mark point P, (to provide minimum walking room in side seam).</p>
<p>D-Q&#8212;From point D, on the line D-E, measure off a distance of one and one-half
  inches and mark point Q. (This adds an equal amount of walking room to back
  section on each side.)</p>
<p>NOTE: Because line K-H is more intensely curved than O-H, it should be shortened
  at K to make two lines of equal length.</p>
<p>Slip another piece of paper beneath your draft and trace off the pattern for
  the back section as follows: A-C-B-P-D-Q-H-O-N-M-L-A. Also trace the position
  of the hip line OM-H. Mark point D to show position of a notch.</p>
<p>Slip another piece of paper beneath your draft and trace off the front section
  as follows: J-G-E-Q-D-P-H-K-J. Trace in position of hip line G-H. Mark D for
  a notch.</p>
<p>Allow normal construction seams at side and waistline. <em>In all your skirt muslins,
  no seam allowances need be added to the lower edge.</em></p>
<p>Place notches and punch hole to show back dart.</p>
<p>Place grain lines at right angles to hip line.</p>
<p>Place notches to indicate position of point D on each section.</p>
<p>Lay finished patterns together as shown in <a href="#169">Fig. 3, page 169</a>. Remove the point
  at the hemline (dotted lines) to produce a continuous, shallow curve.</p>
<p>Produce your muslin proof, leaving ample seam allowance at side seams. Model
  forms vary and your finished sloper should provide same walking room provided
  for in lower portion of model form. When muslin has been approved, make cardboard
  slopers from pattern.</p>
<p>In the instructions given you to make the draft, the rectangle was first established,
  based upon the hip measurements of the back and the front. The back hip dart
  was established as two-thirds of the difference between the back hip measurement
  and the back waist measurement. The remaining third of the difference was left
  to shape the fabric at the side seam. This proportion is that found pleasing
  for the average woman. When you make such a draft for an individual, the muslin
  pattern proof can be assembled without cutting away the areas at the side seam
  and then with the muslin on the individual, the distribution of this tapering
  to meet the waistline can be manipulated according to the actual shape of the
  figure of the customer.</p>
<p>It was mentioned that the basic skirt sloper is seldom used in its simple
  form as a pattern for a skirt. The reason for this is obvious if we will stop
  to reflect that the motion of the limbs when walking is forward and backward.
  Hence, the perfectly plain front, which provides no actual means for the movement
  of the limbs, would have a tendency to wrinkle across the abdomen when the
  figure is in motion. The additional &quot;walking room&quot; added at the side
  seam helps a little, but it isn't actually needed at that point, but is needed
  in the front of the skirt instead.</p>
<p>If you will study your skirt pattern, you will notice that the front was fitted
  in one place only&#8212; at the side seam, yet, in fact, most women have a
  slight curve caused by the abdomen. Hence, should your customer have such a
  figure shape, you might adjust the muslin on her figure to provide a little
  dart about half way between the center front and the side seam. This would
  then reduce the amount of shaping that would be provided at the side seam and
  would <em>distribute</em> the fit more accurately.</p>
<p>Hence, if you wished to produce a &quot;perfectly plain&quot; skirt pattern
  and the individual being fitted had a pronounced curve at K-H, you would establish
  a small dart in the side front between J and I in the draft and then the distance
  from K to I would be established in the same manner that point O on the back
  section was established. Such a dart, if folded out in the pattern and a slash
  is made from the hemline to the dart point to effect shifting fullness to the
  hemline, would be referred to as a &quot;working dart.&quot; It serves a functional
  use in changing the shape of the pattern for a functional reason. The resulting &quot;perfectly
  plain&quot; skirt pattern would have just a little more room at the hemline
  in the front than the basic sloper would have and would be more attractive
  on the figure.</p>
<p>The sloper, as it now is, then, is a diagram or pattern of the measurements
  of the individual to whom it has been fitted. The notches placed at the common
  point D on each section will indicate to you where the &quot;walking room&quot; area
  starts. Some patterns include the use of the walking room. Other patterns eliminate
  the need for it by throwing the movement to the back and front entirely.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><a name="comparative" id="comparative"></a><a href="illust/08-172.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',626,728);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/08-172-t.jpg" alt="The Mrs. Slim through Heavy" width="400" height="342" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>Analysis of Individual Skirt Slopers</em></h3>
<p>The above diagrams show the gradual changes which appear in patterns for increasing
  figure proportions. In these illustrations, the lines across the hip show the
  position of the grain of the fabric, which, in most cases, is not visible.
  Only in rare cases, when a fabric which has a pronounced stripe might be used
  crosswise, would the grain line be apparent. And, by looking at the illustration
  of Mrs. Heavy, you can readily imagine how unsuitable such a skirt would be
  for her. However, it might be used for Mrs. Slim who has a straight waistline
  and hip line.</p>
<p>The hipline is the point from which the skirt is hung. With the various figures,
  the pattern shows more fabric above the hipline at the back while the front
  section shortens a proportionate amount.</p>
<p>The side seams of the skirt may be adjusted as desired to suit the natural
  contour of the figure being fitted. Mrs. Slim, being erect in posture and carriage,
  requires a hip side seam which is practically perpendicular. As the figures
  grow heavier, the side seam is gently curved to conform to the natural contour
  of the figure. In cases where the individual has an excessively bad posture,
  the curve would be limited slightly rather than permit it to repeat the excessively
  bad posture line at the back.</p>
<p>It is <em>technically</em> possible to cut and fit many styles of skirts to certain
  types of figures; but, when the muslin is completed, it becomes obvious that,
  despite the fact that the skirt has been fitted, it is not suited to the individual.
  Therefore, you will soon learn that every individual has certain proportions
  which are flattered most advantageously through only a certain few styles of
  skirts and a certain few silhouettes.</p>
<p>Illustrated herewith are two common types of bad posture which require major
  alterations in ready-to-wear skirts. To correct the fit of a standard size
  skirt for an extreme example of such posture would require ripping the skirt
  apart and re-hanging it entirely. When the case is moderate, the fit may be
  corrected somewhat, but these women should have their clothes specially made
  for them whenever possible.</p>
<p>Fig. 1 probably has rounded shoulders and the resulting &quot;question mark&quot; silhouette
  thrusts the abdomen and hip bones forward and destroys the natural curve of
  the back hips. In fact, her silhouette is about opposite to what it should
  be. The position of her hip level will be lower than normal.</p>
<p class="clear"><em><a href="illust/08-173-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',409,236);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/08-173-a-t.jpg" alt="Figures 1 and 2" width="97" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Fig. 1 shows her wearing a standard size garment. Notice how the curve of
  her abdomen lifts the hemline and pulls the side seam forward. In extreme cases,
  this will cause the side seams of the skirt to ripple. The back section of
  the skirt is completely thrown out of line because of what has happened to
  the front section. Because she does not have the normal curve at the back hips
  provided in the standard garment, it will bulge at the back and probably dip
  at the hemline. It may wrinkle near the waistline also.</p>
<p>Fig. 2 shows a sloper fitted to this same woman. The grain line is established
  at the level of her hips. To accommodate the curve of her abdomen and front
  hip bones, a small dart is placed at each side of the front. The side seam
  is hung as straight as possible and the waistline is dropped at the front slightly
  to hide her bad posture.</p>
<p>When making a skirt of wool fabric, the extra front dart area may be eased
  into the waistband and then steamed out over a curved cushion. When designing
  gored skirts for her, this shaping provided by the dart may be hidden in the
  seams. But that shaping must be provided to achieve a properly hung skirt which
  will hide her physical defects.</p>
<p class="clear"><em><a href="illust/08-173-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',393,288);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/08-173-b-t.jpg" alt="Figures 3 and 4" width="126" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Fig. 3 shows the example of the opposite in bad posture. This is not common
  to large women only. If you will study girls of high school age, you will see
  too many who carry themselves in this manner, thinking, in so doing, they are
  standing &quot;straight.&quot; Note what happens to the fit of the standard
  size garment when worn by such a figure. Because her back hips are thrust outward,
  this lifts the back hemline and pulls the side seams backward. It then causes
  the front section to pull tightly just below the abdomen and wrinkles appear
  in the skirt after a few moments of wearing the garment. You can readily see
  that to properly hang this skirt, it must be ripped apart, lifted all around
  to provide sufficient width to the back section, and entirely re-hung.</p>
<p>Fig. 4 shows how her sloper should be fitted. To eliminate the wrinkling across
  the front the skirt should be suspended from the curve of her abdomen. Due
  to her posture the front waist measurement will be larger than her back waist
  measurement. The back hips being large, the control darts at the back will
  be just that much larger. The waistline should be lifted slightly in the front,
  but a loose belt would have a tendency to drop at the front unless supported
  by being attached to the garment.</p>
<p>Lay your transparent ruler parallel to the center front and sketch in a straight
  line for the side seam. Note that, in order to reduce the evidence of her back
  hip width, it is advisable to shape the line of the side seam with a <em>slight
  curve</em>. Do not let it exactly follow the contour of the back of her body, because
  that would only emphasize that bad line. A <em>modified</em> curve is the best line
  to use in such a situation.</p>
<p>Obviously, even though adjusted, the straight skirt does not flatter such
  a figure. The vertical line of the muslin below the hips only intensifies the
  curve above. With your pencil, lightly sketch in a line on Fig. 4 to widen
  the back of the skirt from the hips to hemline. Her &quot;plain skirt&quot; should
  be made like the following tailored suit skirt pattern.</p>

<p>At first glance, this skirt looks very much like one made from the basic skirt
  sloper. But the normal walking room added to the side seams has been shifted
  to the <em>center back</em> and the side seams have been moved forward slightly to give
  a slenderizing effect from a front view. It is a skirt popularly used to combine
  with tailored suit jackets which require a slim skirt from a front view to
  balance the slim lines of the jacket. It is not generally used as the skirt
  to complete a dress, because of the change of position of the side seams which
  would not conform to those established in the simple bodice. However, there
  is no reason why it could not be used, if the bodice is so designed as to require
  the use of an unattached skirt, as is the case in many evening gowns.</p>
<p>The draft is started by tracing around the back and front sections of the
  basic skirt sloper. (See diagram on following page.) The normal walking room
  is eliminated at the side by placing the notch at the hemline of the back sections
  upon the notch of the front section which has been traced. These seam allowances
  are shown by the solid lines extending from point H on the diagram. When tracing
  is completed, label all points from A to L as illustrated.</p>
<p>Dotted lines show procedure. The dimensions given below are suitable for a
  size 14 or 16 skirt.</p>
<p class="clear"><em><a href="illust/08-175.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',432,669);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/08-175-t.jpg" alt="Drafting the tailored suit skirt pattern" width="276" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>M&#8212;Locate this point one inch to the right of point H.</p>
<p>N&#8212;Locate this point three-fourths inch from point G. (This straightens the
  curve of new side seam slightly and enlarges waistline one-fourth inch.)</p>
<p>M-N&#8212;Draw new front side seam N-M.</p>
<p>O&#8212;Place this point one inch from point I.</p>
<p>O-M&#8212;Draw the new back section side seam O-M.</p>
<p>P&#8212;Locate point P one inch to right of point J.</p>
<p>Q&#8212;Locate point Q one inch to right of point K. (This reduces size of normal
  back darts and moves them out slightly for better proportion.)</p>
<p>R&#8212;Locate point R one and one-half inches from point L. (This reduces size
  of back dart one-half inch.)</p>
<p>R-Q-P&#8212;Draw in new dart R-Q-P.</p>
<p>In locating point N, waistline was enlarged one-fourth inch.</p>
<p>In locating point R, you reduced width of the dart one-half inch.</p>
<p>S&#8212;Hence, locate point S three-fourths inch from point A.</p>
<p>T&#8212;Extend line from S through point B equal to original center back skirt
  length of original skirt sloper A-B-C. Note that the extra walking room appears
  between
  points T and C. Square hemline T-C from point T to C.</p>
<p>U&#8212;This point marks the normal amount of walking room which extended beyond
  the notch in tracing your back section.</p>
<p>M-U&#8212;Connect point U with the new side hip point M. This makes the dotted
  line O-M-U the side seam of the back section of your new draft.</p>
<p>M-D&#8212;The new front section side seam is established by connecting point M
  with point D. Line N-M-D becomes the new side seam of the front section.</p>
<p>On another piece of pattern paper, trace off the following front and back
  sections:</p>
<p><em>Front</em>: E-F-N-M-D-E.</p>
<p><em>Back</em>: T-B-S-R-Q-P-0-M-U-D-C-T.</p>
<p>Trace along perforated lines with blue pencil to observe shape of the new
  pattern when compared to basic sloper.</p>
<p>Establish grain from center back and center front edges of pattern. Note that,
  due to the extra sweep being centered at the back, skirt hem does not appear
  on a parallel with hip level.</p>
<p>Complete pattern by adding symbols shown and produce the muslin proof for
  the entire skirt so you may notice the resulting silhouette. Study it from
  every angle and compare it with muslin from a basic skirt sloper. If you have
  recorded grain lines at the hip, you will see the results if this pattern were
  to be used for pronounced plaids or stripes. It has its limitations as most
  patterns have.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><a href="illust/08-176-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',239,222);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/08-176-a-t.jpg" alt="Multiple darts in skirt" width="161" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>Multiple Darts</em></h3>
<p>When you design skirts for women having a large back hip measurement and a
  small back waist measurement, the back dart must necessarily be very large
  to provide the shaping for the pronounced curve. In such cases, it is advisable
  to divide the basic control dart as was suggested in bodices. The method used
  would be just like that which you have previously studied in sleeves and bodices.</p>
<p>When striped fabrics are being used, dividing the control in this manner will
  also aid in concealing the control somewhat. The result will bring further
  emphasis upon the pattern of the fabric and will reduce the obvious appearance
  of the necessary darts required to shape the fabric to the badly proportioned
  figure.</p>
<h3><em><a name="width" id="width"></a>Skirt Patterns Cut According to Fabric Width</em></h3>
<p>The skirts included in this group are usually designed &quot;according to
  the cloth.&quot; On some occasions, the fabric being too narrow to use lengthwise
  without seams, it may be used crosswise. Wholesale designers arrange position
  of pleats to aid in hiding the piecing seams when possible.</p>
<p>All of these skirts are based upon the methods used for making your basic
  sloper. The measurements which you took for that problem could be used for
  these. When a basic sloper has been fitted to an individual, it may serve as
  the basis for making any one of these skirts as it will give the information
  as to skirt length, front and back hip measurements and the best position for
  the basic darts as well as the amount of drop to the front waistline.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><a href="illust/08-176-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',380,139);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/08-176-b-t.jpg" alt="Wrap-around skirt" width="66" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>Wrap-Around Skirt (Pencil Silhouette)</em></h3>
<p>The hemline of the true wrap-around skirt equals the hip circumference. The
  little walking room is provided by the lap which is left open for expansion.
  This same type skirt is simulated, occasionally, with the minimum amount of
  expansion added at the side seams and the remaining expansion provided by the
  lap. The degree of lap is a matter of choice. More may be added to the under
  portion than on the upper portion, if desired.</p>
<p>Obviously, this is not a skirt for the woman with heavy thighs and small hips.
  But it may be used successfully for the woman having heavy hips and tapering
  limbs, because her excessive hip measurement provides plenty of walking room
  in the lower portion of the skirt.</p>
<p>NOTE: All dress model forms, except those designed for bathing suit designers,
  are so shaped as to provide necessary walking room below hip level. For this
  reason, this type of skirt cannot be tested on a model form. Yet it may be
  successfully worn by an individual having suitable proportions.</p>

Use pattern paper equal to desired skirt lengths <em>plus</em> 3 inches.

<p><strong>2. Follow previous instructions given for making basic skirt sloper but eliminate
  steps used to establish points P and Q. As there are no side seams in this
  skirt, no walking room will be added at that point.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. To establish lap, extend lines A-F, C-G and B-E a distance equal to desired
  amount of lap. Connect points Q-P-R with straight vertical line.</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. Fold pattern paper on line F-E. Trace along line J-K. This establishes
  curve of waistline in lap portion.</strong></p>
<p><strong>5. Label pattern for fold in center back and vertical grain indicator squared
  from hip line. Allow normal seam at waistline. Edge of lap S-P-Q may be selvedge
  of fabric or it may have a hem.</strong></p>
<p><strong>6. Complete muslin proof. Trace in position of normal hipline and normal position
  of side line H-D so these blue lines will aid in judging results. <em>The hip-line
  and normal side seam position should always be traced into muslin proofs.</em></strong></p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><strong><a href="illust/08-177-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',376,172);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/08-177-b-t.jpg" alt="Peasant skirt" width="85" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>Peasant Skirts</em></h3>
<p>The &quot;peasant&quot; skirt is so called because it is so typical of that
  worn by the lower classes in Europe. It has reappeared in fashion again and
  again and the persistently popular &quot;dirndl&quot; of Swiss origin will
  be recognized as being merely a revival of the peasant skirt.</p>
<p>Though the skirt appears to be elementary as to cut, to meet the standard
  of good fit, it should be carefully cut to conform to the requirements that
  appear in a basic skirt sloper. Obviously, it is a skirt to be worn by the
  youthful slender figure as the closely fitted bodice reveals the actual size
  of the wearer and the exaggerated skirt provides a charming contrast.</p>
<p>The following diagram illustrates how a tracing is made from the basic skirt
  sloper in a similar manner to that used for the &quot;wrap-around&quot; skirt
  except that no lap is added.</p>
<p class="clear"><strong><em><a href="illust/08-178-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',303,225);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/08-178-a-t.jpg" alt="Draft for peasant skirt" width="127" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em></strong><a name="178" id="178"></a>This construction pattern is then divided into sections. Note that the front
  and back sections, which allow for a fold at that point, are just half the
  width of the remaining sections. Number the sections.</p>
<p>The back hip dart and side seam shaping are ignored. Hip level line is clearly
  marked. Also the position of the side seam.</p>
<p>On a new piece of final pattern paper, a horizontal guide line should be drawn.
  The construction pattern should be cut apart and the sections should be spread
  apart, as for balanced fullness, with the original hip level line resting squarely
  upon the guide line.</p>
<p>NOTE: Experiment has proved that, because the fabric of the skirt must be
  gathered into a closely fitted waistline, it is best to proportion the degree
  of fullness according to the waist measurement. A three to one proportion,
  which makes the new skirt waist measurement three times that of the basic skirt
  measurement is nice for average fabrics. There is no set rule, of course. Because
  the hip measurement on the sloper is larger than that of the waistline, this
  will make the finished skirt slightly less than three times the normal hip
  measurement.</p>
<p>Blend in the normal curve at the top of the skirt. Record the position of
  the normal side seam and the grain indicators should be at right angles to
  the guide line. Label back and front for fold of fabric. Cut skirt pattern
  apart on side seam line I-D and notch for assembling.</p>
<p class="clear"><em><strong><a href="illust/08-178-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',423,276);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/08-178-b-t.jpg" alt="Adjustments to skirt attachment" width="111" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em>NOTE: 2 lengths of 39 inch fabric would provide a waist circumference of 78
  inches. A person having a 26 inch waist measurement would need only two lengths
  of such fabric and the seams would be placed at the side. If a narrow fabric
  is being used, the position of the seams would be placed accordingly. When
  two and one half widths of fabric are used, usually the narrow section is used
  at the front, the two wider sections then meet at a seam in the center back.</p>
<p><em>When this skirt is being designed to attach to a bodice which has a shaped
  lower edge&#8212;a point at the front, or a dropped waistline at the back the
  construction pattern should first be shaped accordingly and then cut apart
  and spread in usual manner. See diagrams below. </em></p>
<h3><em>Simulated Peasant Skirts</em></h3>
<p class="clear"><em><strong><a href="illust/08-179.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',362,728);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/08-179-t.jpg" alt="Simulated peasasnt skirts" width="362" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em>The true peasant skirt discussed previously obviously produces an oblong silhouette
  which has a hemline equal to that gathered into the bodice at the waist. Hence,
  designers sometimes introduce a semblance of a circular sweep, thereby exaggerating
  the sweep at the hem and reducing the bulk in the area of the waistline. This
  makes the skirt more suitable to women of less slender measurements.</p>
<p>Again the proportion may vary with the fabric being used. If you are using
  a full length skirt sloper, then the width at the hemline should be increased
  to that used at the waistline to give the final silhouette a pleasing balance.
  For example: If the waistline measurement in the skirt will be double that
  provided in the sloper, the hemline should be four times that provided in the
  sloper.  On short, daytime length skirts, the sweep at the hemline may be
  only three times that provided in the sloper.</p>
<p>The method for making the construction pattern is like that used for making
  the true peasant skirt. The diagram shows a three-to-one proportion of spreading
  the sections.</p>
<p>Usually such skirts are cut in four sections, with the grain of the fabric
  centered in each section. Occasionally, the center back and front are cut on
  a fold, but this throws the side seams on a more pronounced bias of the fabric
  and gives the skirt
  less balance. It will have a tendency to give a flat appearance to the front
  and back of the skirt when worn.</p>
<p>When experimenting with this skirt it is a good plan to mark the muslin on
  the grain into stripes and then observe the results.</p>
<p>If desired, this skirt may have an increasing amount of gathers at the back,
  merely by spreading the sections more in that area. In such cases, notches
  should be carefully placed at the waistline to indicate the position of center
  front, side seams and center back so that gathers will be intensified as planned
  in the pattern. It is most successful in crisp fabrics.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><strong><a href="illust/08-180-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',465,358);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/08-180-a-t.jpg" alt="Full circle skirt" width="133" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>Full Circular Skirts</em></h3>
<p>The true circular skirt&#8212;cut on the basis of a circle&#8212;is not becoming
  to some women as it will necessarily increase the appearance of the wearer's
  hip measurement. For that reason, it is not found in average day-time dresses
  but is found more frequently in housecoats or evening gowns. It is the basis
  for many skating skirts as it is particularly flattering when the figure is
  in motion and is flattering to the exposed thighs in motion. Bouffant evening
  gowns of net, chiffon or tulle may be made of several circles.</p>
<p class="clear"><em><strong><a href="illust/08-180-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',304,533);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/08-180-b-t.jpg" alt="Diagram for circle skirt layout" width="316" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em>The diagram shows how to plan a skirt on the basis of a single circle. A-B-C,
  the waistline, is a true half circle equal to half the waistline <em>less two
  inches</em>.
  By cutting the waistline a little small, this makes allowance for the natural
  tendency of the fabric to stretch when final garment is assembled. A-D and
  C-F should equal the desired side skirt length. B-E is the center front skirt
  length. B-G is the back skirt length.</p>
<p>Note the dotted line showing position of piecing. Although the skirt might
  be pieced on D-A and C-F, usually designers prefer to place the piecing, carefully
  matched, down into the ripples of the skirt where it will be less obvious.
  Wherever possible, the piecing should be made with the grain, as if to widen
  the fabric.</p>
<p>The skating skirt, when made of more than one circle will ripple gracefully
  at the edge instead of assuming a disc-like silhouette when the figure is whirling
  rapidly. The plans for skirts involving more than one circle are as follows:</p>
<p>For a circle and a half: Divide the waist measurement, <em>less two inches</em>, into
  thirds. Use two thirds for the waistline of a complete circle and the remaining
  one third for the extra half circle.</p>
<p>For two full circles: Divide the waist measurement, <em>less two inches</em> into halves.
  Use one half for the basis for making a circular section. Make a duplicate
  pattern from that. Adjust front length in that area.</p>
<p><a name="circular" id="circular"></a>Full circular skirts are best planned on the basis of a circle or more, or
  a circle and a half. To introduce a third of a circle would cause some seams
  to be partially on a bias and would affect the hang of the skirt.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><strong><a href="illust/08-181-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',419,712);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/08-181-a-t.jpg" alt="Semi-circular skirts" width="304" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>Semi-Circular
    Skirts</em></h3>
<p>This semi-circular skirt, based upon but a half circle of fabric is more generally
  found in day-time dresses when this silhouette is in fashion. The waistline
  measurement is reduced proportionately, and by stretching it slightly when
  constructing the garment, the area immediately below the waistline is made
  to fit more smoothly and the points of the ripples will be lower by so doing.
  Nevertheless, this skirt breaks above the hip level and has the tendency to
  increase the appearance of the wearer's hip measurement. For this reason, it
  is a choice of many women and girls who have small waistlines and broad hips
  and thighs. It hides a defect which would be otherwise revealed in a skirt
  of more vertical silhouette!</p>
<p>The diagram shows how to make the pattern for the front section of the skirt.
  Line A-E-B is a quarter circle equal to normal waistline less one inch.</p>
<p>E-F equals center front length </p>
<p>A-C and B-D equal the side length</p>
<p>A similar quarter circle pattern is made from the back measurements with the
  line E-F equaling the center back length.</p>
<p>NOTE: This skirt may be cut with the four seams and the bias grain of the
  fabric placed in the center of each section in stiff fabrics that do not have
  a tendency to sag. However, it is most popularly cut as indicated in the diagram,
  with the grain of the fabric placed at the side seams and the center front
  seam (or fold) falling on a bias. When hung in this manner, the center front
  and back will have a tendency to sag slightly and thereby bring the fabric
  to that point. It will then ripple at the center front and back more intensely
  than at the sides and will be more slenderizing when worn. This is a popular
  skirt with manufacturers' designers, as it is so adaptable for many fabrics.
  It also adjusts nicely on figures of varying hip proportions.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a name="simulated" id="simulated"></a><em><strong><a href="illust/08-182-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',363,184);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/08-182-a-t.jpg" alt="Simulated semi-circular skirts" width="84" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em>The Simulated Circular Skirt</h3>
<p>This simulated circular skirt produces a silhouette which is actually fitted
  down to the hip level and then the ripples break into a soft modified movement
  around the thighs, increasing in sweep to the hemline. To produce this pattern,
  a new method is used which introduces the use of a &quot;working dart.&quot;</p>
<p>As illustrated here, it is shown as a two-pieced skirt with seams at the sides
  only. The center front and back of the skirt are on the straight, vertical
  grain of the fabric. But because the side seams are cut on a straight line,
  it would be possible to place the straight grain of the fabric at the sides
  and the side seam might even be eliminated entirely. This would throw the bias
  towards the <em>center front</em> seam and, like the semi-circular skirt previously
  discussed, the ripples would naturally shift to the center front and back position.</p>
<p>The accompanying diagram shows how the pattern is made from the basic skirt
  sloper pattern after it has been traced, <em>including</em> the normal walking room
  at the side seams. The problem is to so shape the pattern to provide for an
  <em>equal</em> distribution of the sweep around the skirt to simulate a circular skirt.</p>
<p class="clear"><em><strong><a href="illust/08-182-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',293,607);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/08-182-b-t.jpg" alt="Draft for simulated semi-circular skirts" width="376" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em>The dotted line from hemline to back basic dart indicates position of slash
  when dart has been folded and pinned. This throws a flare at that point. By
  extending the side seam down in a straight line, additional flare is added
  at the side.</p>
<p>The side of the &quot;working dart&quot; in the front section may equal that
  of the back section, or be slightly smaller, which will lessen the degree of
  flare slightly. When the working dart has been established, the amount used
  for the dart is restored at the side seam to maintain the necessary waistline
  measurement. B-C must equal the original line B-A.</p>
<p>Cut out the construction pattern, fold and pin the darts permanently and slash
  from hemline to dart points. Make final pattern, placing grain at center front
  and back. Try out results in muslin and then try another muslin with pattern
  laid on straight grain at the side seams. Compare your results.</p>
<h3><em><a name="gored" id="gored"></a>Multiple Gored Skirts</em></h3>
<p>Gored skirts may provide a close fit to any desired point for establishing
  the break in a skirt. As the fashion changes, the level of the break may be
  raised or lowered but the proportion established through the vertical seams
  may remain the same. The principle of cutting remains the same.</p>
<p>When planning a gored skirt for an individual, great care should be taken
  in placing the panel seams. Additional top stitching of the seams will aid
  further in slenderizing the wearer. Because the limbs move forward and backward
  while the figure is in motion, more fullness is added to the sweep of the front
  and back of the skirt than at the side. This is not noticeable when the skirt
  is on the figure and it may appear to have an equal distribution of movement
  throughout, but when the sides are widened to equal the movement at the back
  and front, they will appear to have a greater amount than the back and front.
  This silhouette is not a flattering one.</p>
<p>The amount of movement must be dependent upon the draping qualities of the
  fabric to be used. A winter weight tweed suit would appear bunglesome if the
  movement were to be the same as that used in a pattern for a light weight wool
  flannel. When you have made several skirts out of varying fabrics, you will
  soon know just about how much sweep the skirt can have for the texture of fabric.
  If you will clip out photographs of garments showing gored skirts, worn on
  the figure, you will learn much about the draping qualities of fabrics. Sort
  them according to the fabric and according to the amount of movement which
  appears.</p>
<p>One must remember that all gored skirts are actually hung from the hip-line.
  Shaping above and below that point may vary as desired. But usually, when the
  sections have been assembled, the silhouette follows the figure down to, or
  nearly to, the hip level. Observe the importance in placement of fabric grain.</p>
<h3><em><a name="fourgored" id="fourgored"></a>Four-Gored Skirts</em></h3>
<p>There are two examples of four-gored skirts which are favorites in ready-to-wear.
  One is cut on the bias and is suitable for average and light weight soft woolens,
  silk crepes or rayons. The other has less sweep and the sections are cut on
  the straight grain. It is best suited to heavy woolens and  worsteds, corduroys
  or suede leathers.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><strong><a href="illust/08-183.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',368,180);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/08-183-t.jpg" alt="Bias four-gored skirt" width="80" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>Bias Four-Gored Skirt</em></h3>
<p>Because the fabric molds to the figure when cut on the bias, this skirt produces
  a silhouette which appears to have a lower break than it actually has. It may
  also be cut on the straight grain of fabrics having elasticity, such as crepes,
  and it hangs equally well although the break will appear in the normal position.</p>
<p><strong>1. Trace around your front and back skirt slopers as indicated in Fig. 2 on
  next page.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Introduce two small darts in the back which equal the amount of the control
  dart plus <em>one-fourth</em> inch.</strong></p>
<p class="clear"><strong>3. Build out the <em><a href="illust/08-184.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',314,697);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/08-184-t.jpg" alt="Draft for bias four-gored skirt" width="403" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>back side seam that <em>one-fourth</em> inch.</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. Draw in two small darts in the front section which equal the shaping of
  the curve at the side seam from hip to waist. Straighten the side seam accordingly
  to retain original waist measurement.</strong></p>
<p><strong>5. Fold and pin in these darts permanently. Slash from hem to hip level, to
  point of darts.</strong></p>
<p><strong>6. Spread the construction pattern on a piece of final pattern paper as illustrated.</strong></p>
<p><strong>7. Pin the sections down securely. Build out the center back and front seams
  an amount equal to one spread between sections as shown in Fig. 3. This will
  intensify the movement at the center back and front seams where it is most
  needed for walking room.</strong></p>
<p><strong>8. Because the minimum walking room provided in your basic sloper
    was included when the slopers were 
  first traced, the pattern need not be built out at the side unless you have
  a desire to add width at that point for some reason.</strong></p>
<p><strong>9. Complete the pattern, establishing a true bias grain in the center of each
  section. Cut your muslin proof and make an entire skirt to observe result.</strong></p>
<p>When extending a pattern like this into a full length skirt for an evening
  dress, it beautifies the silhouette to intensify the movement at the center
  back. This can be done by <em>increasing</em> the amount built on the center back seam.
  Skirts having trains should always have an increased amount of movement at
  the center back. When the figure is in motion, the skirt will then drag and
  produce a graceful line at the back of the skirt.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><strong><a href="illust/08-185-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',305,701);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/08-185-a-t.jpg" alt="Draft for narrow four-gored skirt" width="418" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong><a name="narrow" id="narrow"></a>Narrow Four-Gored Skirt</em></h3>
<p>The second type on next page should produce a silhouette which is cone shaped
  with little or no rippled movement at hemline.</p>
<p>It is more frequently found in tweeds that have no draping qualities in which
  pleats might prove too bunglesome.</p>
<p><em>This skirt pattern is used as the basis for the semicircular culottes and
  semi-circular shorts explained later. It is an important silhouette to study.</em></p>
<p>The diagrams show proportions found to be satisfactory on average size 14
  figures. If finished muslin indicates too much movement in center back and
  front, reduce the amount of shaping at those points above hip line and the
  flare at hemline will be reduced proportionately in second muslin.</p>
<p>As normal walking room is included when first tracing is made of the sloper,
  side seams need not necessarily be straight. The amount taken off front and
  back center seams can vary, but the finished silhouette of the skirt should
  appear to be merely an extension of the normal widening of the figure from
  waistline to the hip, <em>plus</em> a slight increase flare at the center front where
  the figure is normally quite flat. When using a sloper having shaping darts
  at the front, they may be used as working darts to produce the flare at the
  lower edge. The straight grain of the fabric should fall in the center of each
  section.</p>

<p>The six-gored skirt is sometimes called the &quot;panel skirt.&quot; It is
  a universal favorite as the position of the seams permits expert fitting and
  proportioning of the sections to suit any type of figure.</p>
<p>In this case, flares have been provided and the level of the break of the
  movement varied to drop slightly at the back. This same type of skirt may be
  designed to have limited sweep and then pleats or godets inserted as desired.
  These instructions also demonstrate the method for moving the basic back control
  dart slightly to make it fall in the position for the panel.</p>

  <li><strong>Side Front: J-V-W-LL </strong></li>
  <li><strong>Front Panel: SS-T-U-K</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Allow seams at waistline and on sections as needed and cut out patterns. <em>Be
  sure that all notches are recorded.</em> If muslin is basted and seams pressed,
  results will be shown more clearly.</p>
<p>NOTE: When cutting this skirt for individuals, sweep, point of break and the
  width of panels should be adjusted to height and size of the wearer.</p>
<p>Designers frequently eliminate the normal side seam in this skirt. The pattern
  is made as directed here and then the front and back side section patterns
  are placed together to the level of the hips. This will leave a &quot;dart&quot; above
  the hip level which would be sewed in like any other dart. This permits this
  skirt to become a skirt having only four sections, with the vertical grain
  of the fabric placed in the center of the side section. In factories where
  hundreds of garments are being assembled, this reduces operation costs. And,
  too, it gives the garment more semblance of complication of cut, making it
  more difficult to be copied except by an expert in pattern designing. When
  a garment is being cut from a limited amount of fabric, this method proves
  very practical.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><strong><a href="illust/08-186-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',378,260);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/08-186-b-t.jpg" alt="Eight-gored skirt" width="117" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>Eight-Gored Skirt</em></h3>
<p>In the foregoing skirt designs the movement was added equally on each side
  of the seams to the adjacent sections. This resulted in producing a ripple
  upon which the <em>seam fell on the top</em>. In this design you will learn a way of
  distributing the movement in such manner as to make the seam fall down straight
  and be partially hidden by the ripple at the hemline. In this design, too,
  the degree of sweep has been increased towards the back for greater interest.</p>
<p>This skirt, with the same proportions, was designed for a suit of wool twill
  which had pleasing draping quality. The multiple gores slenderized the hip
  area and also gave the appearance of increased height to the wearer. It accompanied
  a &quot;torso&quot; length jacket of French lining cut, and the seams in both
  jacket and skirt coincided.</p>
<p>As the lower edge of the jacket was level, the position of the skirt &quot;break&quot; was
  made level; had the jacket hem dipped at the back, the &quot;breaks&quot; would
  have followed that line to give a good silhouette. These little details are
  overlooked by many designers. Remember, you must have relationship in horizontal
  and vertical or diagonal divisional lines, as to design and form&#8212;in the
  silhouette. In dark fabrics, divisional lines lose importance; silhouette is
  seen first. In light fabrics,  divisional lines catch the eye, but in good
  design the finished silhouette should also be made as beautiful as possible.</p>

<p>Establish vertical grain indicators at right angles to hip level line on each
  section. Complete final patterns by tracing off sections as in previous problems.
  Allow seams and make sure all notches are recorded. Trace off hip level position
  on each gore when making muslins. Assemble by basting.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><strong><a href="illust/08-188-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',329,238);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/08-188-a-t.jpg" alt="Ten-gored skirt" width="123" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>Ten-Gored Skirt</em></h3>
<p>The ten-gored skirt is made on the same principle as the other multiple-gored
  styles but, due to the number of sections, the back and front sections are
  cut on the fold. In planning the draft, these sections should be half as wide
  as the remaining full sections. The amount of normal shaping on the side seam
  of the front sloper block would be divided into fifths, each one of which would
  be used to shape each gore and the last would be used to shape the side seam.</p>
<p>Likewise, the total amount of shaping provided by the basic control dart in
  the back section, plus any shaping which might be at the back side seam in
  the sloper would be divided into fifths and that amount would be distributed
  in shaping each of the gores in the back portion of the garment.</p>
<p class="clear"><em><strong><a href="illust/08-188-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',255,734);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/08-188-b-t.jpg" alt="Draft for ten-gored skirt" width="500" height="165" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em>NOTE: When cutting such skirts for individuals who are of irregular proportions,
  judgment must be used. A woman having a large abdomen would have little shaping
  at the side of the front sloper. Hence, the sections would have relatively
  little shaping.</p>
<p>This skirt is most attractive in a full length garment. It permits distribution
  of movement as well as variety in the level of the break. Great care should
  be taken in the placing of grain indicators and the notches to avoid errors
  when cutting and assembling the muslin.</p>
<p>In the writer's opinion, the wise designer or hobbyist will devote plenty
  of time in developing several becoming gored skirt patterns. Like basic blocks,
  they can be the basis for designing many interesting frocks all of which will
  include skirts which have proved to be becoming and flattering. As the level
  of the break may change from one season to the next, these minor changes can
  be made in the new patterns, but if the vertical divisional lines have been
  pleasingly established, they never should change. They may create the illusion
  of slenderness to the wearer and they also serve to establish the definite
  position for the folds of the flares which will emphasize these vertical divisional
  lines. The gored skirts have continued to be fashion favorites, year after
  year because they are, when properly proportioned and cut, truly flattering
  to the majority of women.</p>
<h3><em>Variations
    of Gored Skirts</em></h3>
<p class="clear"><em><strong><a href="illust/08-189-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',288,689);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/08-189-a-t.jpg" alt="Variations of  gored skirt" width="437" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em>Gores may be introduced in any portion of the skirt as desired. A gored front
  may be combined with a straight skirt back. The only precaution should be to
  observe the point at which the side seams meet. On some occasions, some of
  the normal walking room should be increased or reduced to &quot;balance&quot; the
  back and front and give a symmetrical appearance to the finished garment.</p>
<h3><em>Shifting Darts and Eliminating Seams</em></h3>
<p class="clear"><em><strong><a href="illust/08-189-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',358,687);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/08-189-b-t.jpg" alt="Shifting darts and eliminating seams" width="345" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em>As you continue your study of skirts, you will become conscious that certain
  silhouettes are produced with each diagram. Many times, the same design of
  cut may be used to produce any silhouette which might be in fashion favor with
  the addition of width to the lower edge. You will also become aware that the
  same elementary principles of cutting which you learned in previous chapters
  are repeated in the cutting of skirts. In this instance, this yoke-panel design
  skirt shifts the basic control darts into the seam of the yoke which is placed
  in just the right position to cross the point of the control dart. The front
  is then made to repeat the functional design of the back section. Because these
  panels form the major design interest in the skirt, the remaining side sections
  are cut as one. The seams of the design become construction seams as well as
  decorative seams. If fashion favored pleats, they might be added under the
  edges of the panel sections. If flared skirts were fashionable, flares might
  be added as desired.</p>
<p>Because no extra walking room is being added at the new seams, the normal
  walking room is included when tracing is made of skirt sloper. The panels should
  widen just a little at the lower edge to conform to the side silhouette of
  the skirt. The upper portion of the curved side seam becomes a dart as was
  the case in the Dolman cape design.</p>
<p>If pleats or flares were to be added at panel edges, then the walking room
  would not be included when slopers were being traced. The finished skirt would
  have front and back movement only.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><strong><a href="illust/08-190.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',360,725);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/08-190-t.jpg" alt="Front fullness" width="363" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>Front Fullness</em></h3>
<p>Here we have a skirt design which gives pronounced interest to front fullness
  in the silhouette. The design of the back yoke gives a flat effect to the back.
  The added flare introduced at the points of the yoke and center front seam
  give the focal point of interest to the skirt, both through design of yoke
  and silhouette. By leaving in the normal walking room, the skirt has a slight
  amount of sweep when viewed from the back, but, if a more extreme effect is
  desired, and the wearer had a figure permitting such extremity of design, the
  normal side width would be left out and this would place still greater emphasis
  upon the front of the skirt where movement is placed.</p>
<p>If wide fabric were to be used, the skirt might be so cut as to have no vertical
  seams except at center front. Otherwise seams would be in normal side position.
  Note that flared section is on a semi-bias.</p>
<h3><em><a name="flounces" id="flounces"></a><strong><a href="illust/08-191-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',295,274);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/08-191-a-t.jpg" alt="Flouncese" width="162" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>Flounces</em></h3>
<p>Flounces frequently return when fashion favors the slim silhouette. They relieve
  the severity of the straight skirt and may provide fullness all around the
  hemline or in certain areas as desired. In the year 1940, they reappeared after
  several seasons of the &quot;swing skirt&quot; which broke from the waistline
  or the hip. When the &quot;torso&quot; silhouette gradually appeared and the
  break of the fullness was lowered generally, flounces naturally appeared to
  provide another means of producing that same silhouette with the use of a different
  cut. A flounce may have balanced fullness at top and bottom or it may be cut
  on the circular principle which will create quite a different silhouette. The
  position may be varied as to the breaking level by the use of diagonal lines
  illustrated below.</p>
<p>The<em><strong><a href="illust/08-191-d.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',559,165);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/08-191-d-t.jpg" alt="Flounces" width="54" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em> principles <em><strong><a href="illust/08-191-c.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',670,292);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/08-191-c-t.jpg" alt="Flounces" width="84" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em>of<em><strong><a href="illust/08-191-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',693,286);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/08-191-b-t.jpg" alt="Flounces" width="79" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em> cutting used to produce jabots and collars should give you
  an immediate cue to the procedure which would be used to produce these flounced
  skirts. The same muslin top may be used to test the three styles for daytime
  wear. It is important to render these problems in order that you may learn
  the value of good proportions.</p>
<p>Movement may be intensified merely by varying the space between the sections
  when you are spreading them.</p>
<h3><em><a name="godets" id="godets"></a>Godets in Skirts</em></h3>
<p>A section of fabric set into a skirt area is called a Godet, pronounced &quot;go-day.&quot; Godets
  may be set into seams to introduce more movement; they may be set in or upon
  a slit made in the area; or they may be set over an area which has been cut
  away from the body of the garment.</p>
<p>Godets which are cut upon the principle of the circle are usually cut on the
  straight grain when the godet is less than a quarter of a circle. When it is
  a quarter, half or full circle, the seam edges can then be on the straight
  grain of the fabric.</p>
<p>The fullness produced by the godet must first be dependent upon the fabric
  being used and secondly upon the length of the skirt itself. A street length
  garment might appear awkward if the godet is cut too full, especially when
  using a firm fabric, such as taffeta or tweed. The evening length skirt would
  appear skimpy if the godet were not generously cut in width to balance the
  length.</p>
<p class="clear"><em><strong><a href="illust/08-192-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',341,740);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/08-192-a-t.jpg" alt="Godets in skirts" width="393" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em>The first skirt shows the godet in a seam. The original skirt pattern might
  have been a modified six-gored pattern. By the addition of the godet, fullness
  is provided without making a new pattern.</p>
<p>The second style is a shaped godet. Because it is laid on the bias, it has
  ripples appearing throughout area. Note how skirt is cut lower to retain close
  hip line under top portion of godet. If this godet were cut on the straight
  it would not ripple and to introduce a ripple, the section would be slashed.</p>
<p class="clear"><em><strong><a href="illust/08-192-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',578,343);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/08-192-b-t.jpg" alt="Godets in skirts" width="116" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em>The third style shows the godet set into a slit made in the body of the skirt.
  Note diagrams showing methods of constructing garment. A normal inside seam
  might be used in the first style. By keeping the seam edges of the godet on
  the grain of fabric, it won't have a tendency to pucker when set in. This requires
  careful stitching as garment is constructed.</p>
<p>On certain occasions, the use of a godet will save fabric. On other occasions,
  it will provide opportunity for greater design interest when using lace and
  fabric et cetera.</p>
<p>These patterns should be carefully worked out to observe possibilities for
  using godets in designing.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><strong><a href="illust/08-193.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',359,678);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/08-193-t.jpg" alt="Pleats in seams" width="340" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong><a name="pleatsinseams" id="pleatsinseams"></a>Pleats in Seams</em></h3>
<p>Pleats may be used to provide walking room to an established silhouette without
  adding movement when figure is not in motion. They remain popular from year
  to year. There are many types &#8212;knife pleat, box pleat, inverted pleat
  and many others known by various names. Principle used for cutting depends
  upon how the fabric will be folded to produce some certain style of pleat.</p>
<p>This first skirt shows the pleat added to the center front. The upper portion
  is reduced to a seam and the lower portion provides the material for the pleat.
  Draw a vertical guide line for center of the pleated section. Locate points
  A and B equidistant from this line, according to depth of the pleat. Place
  sloper a like distance from point A and trace around it. Reverse and do same
  for point
  B. Complete pattern by allowing seams. Dotted lines A and
  B will be the back fold of the inverted pleat. The visible fold will follow
  line of center front seam. Seams could be provided by making extra allowance
  for same after cutting pattern on lines A and B.</p>
<p>Note the method shown for constructing this skirt. In some cases, a slight
  fitting is taken off at center front above hip line and side seam is straightened
  proportionately. This throws slight flare to center front and the visible fold
  will be slightly off grain. Pleat could then be produced as shown above.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><a name="pleats" id="pleats"></a><strong><a href="illust/08-194.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',357,539);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/08-194-t.jpg" alt="Pleats in gored skirts" width="270" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>Pleats in Gored Skirts</em></h3>
<p>In many cases a pleat may be introduced at any existing seam position, such
  as at the side seam in skirts, seams in slightly flared skirts made from the
  <em>narrow four-gored skirt</em> pattern or any other gored pattern to which no rippling
  flare has been already added.</p>
<p>The procedure for this pattern would be to trace around the four-gored front
  section and fold pattern paper on center front line. Extra fabric required
  for desired pleat would be traced in as shown. Usual seam allowance would be
  added to the skirt section and then a pattern of the invisible portion would
  be taken off portion enclosed by A-B and C. This would automatically provide
  seams at the back of the pleats. The finished skirt would resemble the original
  skirt pattern except that extra walking room would have been provided. During
  1939 and 1940, when the modified bell silhouette was used in many tweed suits,
  the suits showed the use of this pattern repeatedly.</p>
<p>The back section of the pleat need not be cut on the straight, but could be
  cut on a bias to introduce a little fabric manipulation which would appear
  only when figure is in motion.</p>
<p>These patterns may be tested in muslin by using the front section only.</p>
<p>Study garments shown in stores. Observe how the designers employ these principles
  of cutting in countless ways.</p>
<p>Many designers use ingenuity in saving fabric and thereby cut manufacturing
  costs. When fashion decrees a slim silhouette, functional pleats may be provided,
  but when the figure is not in motion the silhouette is slim. When fashion favors
  the bell-shaped silhouette, designers use the circular cuts in countless ways
  to create new interest.</p>
<p>The additional styling or finish added to seams must depend upon production
  limitations and upon the fabric employed as the medium. The above skirt is
  a success when cut from suede, wool tweed, denim, taffeta or cotton-back velvet,
  fabrics that have practically no draping qualities but retain the silhouette
  produced by the cut. The same skirt pattern, attempted in a gingham, light-weight
  wool or soft crepe, would collapse at the hem disappointingly. Likewise, the
  depth of a pleat should be sufficiently generous in firm fabrics like wool&#8212; to
  balance the weight of the fabric itself. A very shallow pleat laid in a tweed
  skirt would not remain in press after wearing. In lighter wool, pleats may
  even be laid double, one upon the other, with no excessive appearance of bulk.</p>
<h3><em>Pleats in Godets</em></h3>
<p class="clear">When <em><strong><a href="illust/08-195-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',301,262);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/08-195-b-t.jpg" alt="Pleats in godets" width="151" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em>pleats<em><strong><a href="illust/08-195-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',343,258);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/08-195-a-t.jpg" alt="Pleats in godets" width="129" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em> are set into cut-out areas such as godets, seam edges must be
  carefully planned to make a neat job when the garment is constructed. If you
  will fold a piece of paper into box pleats and then study the second diagram,
  you will visualize the procedure. As no seam should fall on a visible folded
  edge, when the godet section has been cut away, the back of the first pleat
  which is to be part of the garment is established first.</p>
<p>The back center, where the two visible edges will meet are shown by dotted
  lines, the back folds with broken lines and the visible folds with straight
  lines. As a preliminary step, plan a godet which is straight at the top. Then
  complete the pattern and muslin for one which has the shaped top shown. Pleat
  a section of paper and trace across it with diagonal line. Observe the resulting
  notches which must result when pattern is flat.</p>
<h3><em><a name="panels" id="panels"></a>Pleats Adjoining Yoke Panels</em></h3>
<p class="clear">In<em><strong><a href="illust/08-195-d.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',293,215);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/08-195-d-t.jpg" alt="Pleats adjoining yoke panels" width="125" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em> this <em><strong><a href="illust/08-195-c.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',347,263);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/08-195-c-t.jpg" alt="Pleats adjoining yoke panels" width="130" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em>case entire skirt front is cut in one section. This can be done only
  when the shape of yoke makes it possible. In other cases seam would be planned
  at back of the first pleat which forms panel effect. Note that this silhouette
  is straight. The same design could be used to produce a simulated circular
  skirt by using the plain skirt front produced in that problem. In such a case,
  the panel would be planned slightly wider at the hemline to conform to entire
  form of the silhouette. This would cause folded edges of the pleats to fall
  slightly off grain. This problem should be tried in various ways, using varied
  lines of yokes to visualize its limitations.</p>
<h3><em><a name="asymmetric" id="asymmetric"></a>Pleats in Asymmetric Design</em></h3>
<p class="clear"><em><strong><a href="illust/08-196-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',381,703);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/08-196-a-t.jpg" alt="Pleats in asymmetric design" width="331" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em>Pleats can be used as a part of an asymmetric design. They are illustrated
  here in the form of simple knife pleats. Normal seams must be provided on sections
  1 and 2. Note diagram showing the method for mitering point. As shape of yoke
  varies, this detail must be carefully worked out. Obviously this design involving
  stitching close to fabric edge should not be used on materials having a tendency
  to ravel easily.</p>
<p>The lines established to produce informal balance in a skirt are usually first
  established in the bodice and then continued on down around the body into the
  skirt. Review the discussion of formal and informal balance given on <a href="mpd-01.html#balanceindesign">pages
  50 and 51</a>. Use thin paper and trace over the above illustration and then, within
  that silhouette, experiment with diagonal lines from which pleats might be
  suspended to provide walking room in the skirt. Select examples of informal
  balance used in blouses-including the surplice styles&#8212;and try to complete
  the design for the skirt through repetition of the line established in the
  bodice portion. If you have a model form with which to experiment, make several
  construction patterns of back and front bodices and front and back skirt sections.
  These may be made of muslin or paper. They should be pinned up against the
  model form and then, by working <em>around</em> the figure, lines which are established
  in the front may be continued on into the back to establish a feeling of unity.
  View the results of these experiments from front, back and profile views.</p>
<p>Assemble many clipped examples of pleated skirts for observation. You will
  find some that employ asymmetric design involve the use of drapery instead
  of pleats. On <a href="#peg">pages 202 and 203</a> an explanation is given for methods for making
  such types of patterns, some of which employ both.</p>
<h3><em><a name="offgrain" id="offgrain"></a>Pleats at an Angle&#8212;Off Grain</em></h3>
<p class="clear"><em><strong><a href="illust/08-197-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',446,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/08-197-a-t.jpg" alt="Pleats at an angle&#8212;off grain" width="329" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em>During 1939 and 1940, when the bell shaped silhouette was favored for skirts,
  this design appeared frequently in dresses and suits. It is also made from
  the <em>narrow four-gored skirt</em> pattern but in this case, the center front seam
  has been placed on the straight grain fold. A similar skirt could be designed,
  however, using a series of inverted pleats, one of which would be located at
  the center front as diagramed previously.</p>
<p>Note that the dotted lines have been placed to conform to the silhouette of
  the skirt, being spaced wider at the hemline than waistline. Also, when the
  sections are spread, a similar proportion is used.</p>
<p>To study the final result when using a striped fabric, mark your muslin for
  stripes. As some pattern designers prefer to place a seam at the back fold
  of each pleat and then establish the grain on each pleat identically with that
  of the panel, a second such pattern should be made from the first and the muslin
  again marked for stripes. It is then possible to compare the results of the
  two methods in finished muslin. Because the edges of the pleats have a tendency
  to curl slightly when worn, this design is often produced for &quot;unpressed&quot; pleats.
  This of course, adds slightly to the bulk of the silhouette. If sections are
  spread sufficiently, center front can be placed on bias fold and side seams
  will fall on straight of fabric. This is frequently done in light weight plaids.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><strong><a href="illust/08-197-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',336,150);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/08-197-b-t.jpg" alt="Fitted full pleated skirts" width="82" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>Fitted Full Pleated Skirts</em></h3>
<p>The shaped pleated skirt which is made from several straight lengths of fabric
  is usually sent to a pleating company for steam pleating. The fabric should
  be planned and seamed except for the last seam so that it will reach the pleater
  flat. The hem should be previously basted into position also.</p>
<p>Pleats should be planned according to measurement of size being made. A 40
  inch hip could have twenty 2 inch pleats. A 36 inch hip could have eighteen
  2 inch pleats and so on. The depth of the pleat itself determines how many
  lengths of the fabric will be required. Fig. 1 shows the shallow pleat which
  requires twice the finished hip measurement. Fig. 2 shows the deep pleat which
  requires three times the finished hip measurement. When planning a skirt which
  will have a low break, at least 2 extra inches should be added to normal hip
  measurement to provide walking room from hip level to break.</p>
<p class="clear"><em><strong><a href="illust/08-198-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',118,329);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/08-198-a-t.jpg" alt="Figures 1 and 2" width="200" height="63" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em>When fabric is returned from pleater, a strong basting thread should be back
  stitched across the skirt on the hip level and down to break. The open seam
  should be finished. Skirt must then be fitted in the normal amount provided
  for in original sloper at side seams and basic back darts. This shaping must
  be done in those same areas to produce a smooth fit. In manufacturing plants,
  this is estimated by measurements taken from the model form. For individuals,
  a personal fitting would be requested. This is done by lapping over the visible
  edges of the pleats and the area re-pressed into position. The front waistline
  is then shaped to the normal curve as provided in basic sloper so that the
  skirt will not drop downward at the front to cause pleats to spread at hemline.
  Similar procedure would be used when using group pleatings spaced evenly.</p>
<h3 class="class"><em><strong><a href="illust/08-198-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',662,376);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/08-198-b-t.jpg" alt="Simulated circular pleated skirt" width="111" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>Simulated Circular Pleated Skirt</em></h3>
<p>Here we have a design for a skirt which was also popular from 1938 to 1940
  when the bell shaped silhouette was in fashion. Many similar designs were produced
  those years all of which produced a somewhat similar finished form. The method
  for preparing the construction pattern is quite similar to that used for producing
  the first type of four-gored skirt <em>except</em> that in this case <em>the
  normal walking room at side seam is eliminated</em> when sloper tracing is made. The final
  amount
  added at the side seam of each section equals half the amount of area which
  is produced when darts have been folded into position and the pattern has been
  slashed from hemline to point of dart.</p>
<p>Note that the center front and back seams have not been used in this instance,
  but the center front has been placed on a <em>true bias fold</em>. These pleats might
  be inverted instead of pleated and if a greater number were desired, the method
  would be the same only that more working darts would be established from the
  waistline to hip level. The proportions given here produced a shapely garment
  when cut from light weight wool.</p>
<p>Because normal walking room was not included, these pleats will not lie flat
  as might be the case in the former straight skirt. The fan-like pleats therefore
  produce quite a different silhouette. This design would not be practical for
  use for material which does not take a press easily.</p>
<h3><em>Circular Pleated Godet</em></h3>
<p class="clear">An <em><strong><a href="illust/08-199-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',284,224);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/08-199-b-t.jpg" alt="Circular pleated goden" width="140" height="181" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em>interesting <em><strong><a href="illust/08-199-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',370,327);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/08-199-a-t.jpg" alt="Circular pleated goden" width="154" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em>variation of the flared godet is that which is &quot;sunburst&quot; pleated
  and set into slash in the garment. As such a godet might lead to construction
  difficulties in a finished garment, the designer foresees this difficulty and
  plans a bit of ornamental interest which becomes a part of the design but which
  at the same time will give the garment a neat appearance when finished. A similar
  theme could be introduced in the sleeves and upper portion of the garment to
  produce a feeling of unity through repetition.</p>
<p>Circular skirts may be designed to use sunburst effects and this service is
  available at the pleating companies. It is wise to consult them on the preparation
  of the fabric to insure satisfactory results based upon their mechanical methods.</p>
<p>After studying these basic methods which are common to certain silhouettes,
  you should be prepared to originate several interesting designs of your own.</p>
<h3><strong><a name="novelty" id="novelty"></a></strong>NOVELTY SKIRTS</h3>
<p>The following illustrations and diagrams show the possibility for producing
  the various silhouettes &#8212;with or without drapery&#8212;through the block
  system. In former years, most of such skirts would have been draped upon the
  model in muslin. The muslin would then be opened, placed upon the table, corrected
  and the paper pattern made and tested once more.</p>
<p>Space prevents illustrating many of these more complex designs, but our student,
  ambitious to become an expert, should spend hours reproducing complicated cuts
  by recognized designers. The music student eagerly observes the works of master
  musicians, attends concerts to study the rendition of compositions&#8212;not
  to imitate, but rather to chart his own limitations and to spur him to emulation.
  Such effort encourages the student pattern designer to present his own work,
  certain that his good creations eventually will bring him recognition as an
  expert.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><a name="backward" id="backward"></a><strong><a href="illust/08-200-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',340,433);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/08-200-a-t.jpg" alt="Back fullness" width="226" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>Back Fullness</em></h3>
<p>Peplum patterns should be traced off first. Darts are folded in and final
  pattern made for each as shown in diagram.</p>
<p>A portion of the normal back dart is then moved to center back and same amount
  restored to dart area. Lines A-B and A-C will meet in a seam and must be of
  equal length.</p>
<p>By lengthening line D-E, a train is added which must be balanced by ample
  width at the hemline. Short darts substituting for side seam shaping arc hidden
  under peplums.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><a name="cowl" id="cowl"></a><strong><a href="illust/08-200-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',490,725);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/08-200-b-t.jpg" alt="The cowl skirt" width="263" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>The Cowl Skirt</em></h3>
<p>In previous pages, the principle of cutting the cowl bodice and cowl sleeve
  was shown. The illustration shown below presents a version of the cowl skirt
  which has additional movement added at the center front and back seams. This
  skirt is sophisticated and graceful and because of the heavy drapery at the
  sides and the vertical folds of fabric intensified at the front and back, it
  gives the wearer a tall, slender appearance.</p>
<p>Notice that the amount folded into the back basic dart has been restored and
  the fitting removed at center back and the side seam. This would be possible
  only by cutting the upper portion on a true bias. The weight of the drapery
  causes the fabric to adjust to the average size figure. Points A and C may
  be located at any distance from the side seam to place drapery at any desired
  level. When pattern has been completed, A-B and C-D are placed together on
  the vertical grain of the fabric and the seam eliminated. This throws the sections
  on a true bias. The center front and back flares may be on a partial bias.
  In the soft silk crepe fabric used, this produced a beautifully hung skirt.
  Weights were sewed at points A-C and this caused the cowl to collapse heavily
  at the sides.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><a name="peg" id="peg"></a><strong><a href="illust/08-201-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',437,602);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/08-201-b-t.jpg" alt="Peg-top silhouette" width="244" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>&quot;Peg-Top&quot; Silhouette</em></h3>
<p>From 1912 to 1916 this novelty skirt (rather ungainly, grotesque garment of
  uncertain origin) held the fashion spotlight. While experimenting with the
  possibility of producing this silhouette through the block system, the following
  diagram resulted. The curved line starts below the hip level, and should be
  placed in the position desired. The curved slash lines require careful pinning
  of the curved pleats to form the drapery. This is best accomplished by holding
  the fabric over the hand while pinning and starting at the waistline and pinning
  downward about an inch. Obviously, such pleats fall into drapery and would
  not be stitched down like a straight pleat. Records show that they were treated
  like folds of fabric. If desired, the center back can be cut on a fold and
  this will throw the side and front on a more pronounced bias.</p>
<p>A similar silhouette can also be produced through the use of the cowl principle
  but the drapery would fall from a single point at the waistline.</p>
<p>As this book goes to press, fashion trade papers are hailing the trend towards
  a revival of the &quot;peg-top&quot; silhouette in afternoon and dinner dresses.
  As 1942's skirt is short, designers are arranging the folds of material differently
  for proportion's sake. In some cases, a high cowl cut starting from the waistline
  is employed. Hemlines are kept narrow; all drapery is placed at the front.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><strong><a href="illust/08-202-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',382,468);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/08-202-a-t.jpg" alt="1942 style peg-top silhouette" width="217" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>Peg-Top, 1942 Style</em></h3>
<p>Inserted pleats below a cowl drapery provide the walking room and yet maintain
  a slender silhouette. A skeleton lining to which the point B-F might be attached
  would keep the skirt from sagging with prolonged wear. Side darts might be
  substituted for side seams.</p>
<h3><em><a name="drapery" id="drapery"></a>Draped Skirt</em></h3>
<p class="clear"><em><strong><a href="illust/08-202-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',384,578);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/08-202-b-t.jpg" alt="Draped skirt" width="268" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em>To allow for fabric stretching on the bias, as it will be at the center front
  when sections have been spread for drapery, the waistline is reduced slightly.</p>
<p>Notice how vertical flare is first added to construction pattern to provide
  walking room and to invite further interest to the point of interest in the
  skirt. To make the finished silhouette less tubular, the normal walking room
  could be used when making construction pattern.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><strong><a href="illust/08-203-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',374,598);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/08-203-a-t.jpg" alt="Draped asymmetric design" width="286" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>Draped Asymmetric Design</em></h3>
<p>Sketch in the design with pattern on the form to establish pleasing proportions.
  Note that movement is greater at back than front. Trace off gore patterns and
  then cut away remaining segments. Fold in the darts and slash.</p>
<p>Normal walking room might be retained if desired.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><a name="peplum" id="peplum"></a><strong><a href="illust/08-203-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',362,730);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/08-203-b-t.jpg" alt="Draped peplum-jabot-wrap-around skirt" width="363" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>Draped Peplum-Jabot-Wrap-Around Skirt</em></h3>
<p>The name merely denotes principles employed in producing the pattern.</p>
<p> Peplum sections are traced off first and assembled as shown, in one continuous
    piece. Lower portion 1 of skirt front is discarded. Necessary laps for wraparound
    added last.</p>

  </p>
<p>    <a name="analysis" id="analysis"></a>This chapter will be devoted to the discussion of outer garments. In the previous
  chapter you studied how to produce slips by assembling waist and skirt patterns
  or using hip length slopers. This same method would be used for making any
full length garment.</p>
<p>The designing and making of coats involve many principles of garment construction
  which make it a highly specialized field in the industry. As it is closely
  related to the men's tailoring field it is natural to observe that many men
  have entered this phase of designing. Usually a manufacturer will specialize
  in coats and suits.</p>
<p><a name="fabric" id="fabric"></a>The actual making of the pattern differs little from the method which would
  be used to produce any other garment pattern. The principles of cutting are
  much the same. The fabric is limiting, as only a certain amount of manipulation
  can be done in the bulky fabrics used for making outer garments. If the fabric
  used is much the same as that to be used for dresses, the styling may be similar
  to a dress, but if it is thick and bulky the designer must rely upon silhouette
  interest and proportionate spacing for beauty in his garments. If the fabric
  is a hard twisted worsted, such as that which would be used in producing men's
  suits, then the finished woman's suit will be as simply cut as a man's garment
  and will resemble a man's suit.</p>
<p>Coats and suits made from softer fabrics which have been especially designed
  for the purpose are usually referred to in the fashion terms as being &quot;dressmaker
  types.&quot; That is an apt term because it means that the fabric is sufficiently
  soft and pliable to require no special heavy pressing equipment and therefore
  the garment may be created by the small dressmaker who might also create dresses.
  The second type is called the &quot;man-tailored&quot; garment and to turn
  out such a garment, the workmanship must be that commonly used in finishing
  men's apparel. It has a distinctly mannish appearance.</p>
<p>As the construction of the latter would require special training and equipment,
  it is natural that the majority of women's coats fall under the classification
  of &quot;dressmaker type&quot; garments.</p>
<p><a name="lining" id="lining"></a>Although the majority of coats have a lining, occasionally summer weight garments
  are partially lined only. The pattern for the lining of the coat should be
  slightly smaller than that for the coat. Some dressmakers use the same pattern
  for cutting the lining but, when the seams are stitched, they are made slightly
  deeper than the original seam allowance and this process reduces the size of
  the lining slightly. Naturally, the more seams there may be in a garment, as
  in vertical fitting, the less the adjustment would be in each seam. The length
  of the lining is not altered. About one half inch reduction across the front
  and back should be quite sufficient.</p>
<p>If you will notice finished garments, you will usually see a vertical pleat
  laid in the lining at the center back. This provides expansion with arm movement.
  As wool will stretch to accommodate body movements and silk will not, this
  pleat is important.</p>
<p>As all coats must be designed to close at the front or side, a facing is needed
  to finish the front. Usually this facing is made from six to eight inches in
  width and it takes in the front neck section also. This facing would be made
  from the final garment pattern. Inspect finished garments for facings.</p>
<p>From 1938 to 1942, padded shoulders have been included in many dresses, and
  in most outer garments for several years. When paddings are to be used, allowance
  must be made in the pattern for that added bulk. Such methods have been diagramed
  previously. (<a href="mpd-05.html#padding">See page 125</a>.)</p>
<p>The methods used for cutting and fitting most full length garments may be
  classified as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Vertical seam fitting</em>.</li>
<li><em>Seamed waistline with control darts</em>.</li>
<li><em>Combination of these two</em>.</li>
<li><em>Straight, Boxy or Swagger types</em>.</li>
<li><em>Combination Straight or Fitted with Swagger</em>.</li></ol>
<p><a name="silhouettes" id="silhouettes"></a>The prevailing silhouette of any
  season will determine which of the foregoing methods would be used the most.
  Illustrations and diagrams showing the method
  for cutting the pattern for each type are furnished herewith. It is suggested
  that you work up all of these designs so that you may observe the results.
  The sleeves have been included to show you how the garment is coordinated
  in its design theme. These need not be worked up because your interest at this
  moment is the study of silhouette of the body of the garment.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><a name="vertical" id="vertical"></a>V<strong><a href="illust/11-230.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',532,734);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/11-230-t.jpg" alt="Figures 1 through 3" width="244" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>ertical Fitting</em></h3>
<p>The pattern for this style of garment&#8212;with many variations&#8212;could
  be produced from any of the variations of the French Lining jacket patterns
  illustrated in this text. It is essential that the jacket pattern being used
  be designed so as to provide for the hip line to fall on the horizontal grain
  of the fabric. Turn back to the section devoted to jackets (<a href="mpd-03.html#complete">page
  82</a>) and note
  which of the patterns provide the proper hip line and which do not. When completing
  your pattern for this design, introduce greater sweep to the hemline.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><a name="seamed" id="seamed"></a><strong><a href="illust/11-231.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',449,687);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/11-231-t.jpg" alt="Figures 1 through 3" width="272" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>Seamed Waistline Fitting</em></h3>
<p>The coat which has a seamed waistline may be developed from any combination
  of bodice and skirt patterns in just the same manner as a dress, except that
  provision must be allowed for an opening down the front or side. Note that
  grain indicators are established in construction pattern. The side front skirt
  section, when finally attached to the bodice front panel
  will maintain the original shaping which was provided from waist to hip in
  sloper. Front facing
  eliminates yoke seam. No lap is required in this design.</p>
<p>By slashing sleeve from wrist to point of elbow dart, basic elbow control
  dart is closed partially and thus the larger wrist measurement required in
  a coat is provided. The back bodice darts are treated as soft waistline <a name="fullness" id="fullness"></a>fullness
  between notches.</p>
<p>This is a youthful design which might be made of a bulky novelty silk or rayon
  crepe, medium or light weight wool. Such designs involving gentle fullness
  might also be found in soft, thin fur pelts such as kid or broadtail caracul.
  This design also suggests opportunity for interesting manipulation if a striped
  fabric were selected for it. When using the fabric on a bias to secure a diagonal
  effect, the sections being so handled would have a new grain indicator placed
  from the present line with the aid of the triangle, as instructed in previous
  chapters. This design also suggests the possibility of using a combination
  of fur and fabric, the yoke and side front sections being made of sheared beaver
  or some other flat fur and the remaining portions made of a thick wool. In
  such case, the portions which would be covered with fur need not be made from
  expensive wool but could be cut from pre-shrunk lining cotton.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><a name="combo" id="combo"></a><strong><a href="illust/11-232.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',842,742);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/11-232-t.jpg" alt="Combination fitting" width="154" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>Combination Fitting</em></h3>
<p>This pleasing design for a coat is made from a variation of the French lining
  with center front panel seamed at the waistline to provide opportunity for
  placing more<a name="fullneses" id="fullness"></a> fullness below the waist than above it. The belt is merely an
  extension from the side sections. This produces a silhouette having a &quot;forward
  movement&quot; and would be suitable for the angular type figure. The sleeves
  are a modified Bishop style gathered into cuffs which are large enough to slip
  over the hand easily. Together with the soft roll reefer collar, this added
  bulk would softly flatter the extra slender woman.</p>
<p>This style might also be adapted as a maternity coat, the gathered center
  front being made with an elastic which would make the garment adjustable for
  wear during the earlier months. The fabric for this &quot;dressmaker type&quot; garment
  should have pleasing draping qualities because of the use of gathers.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><strong><a href="illust/11-233-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',348,319);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/11-233-a-t.jpg" alt="Boxxy type silhouette" width="160" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong><a name="boxy" id="boxy"></a>Boxy Type Silhouette</em></h3>
<p>The boxy and swagger silhouettes require control maintained above the bust
  and the shoulder blades just as the Dolman cape would. This may be accomplished
  by concealing the control in some seam of the design or it might be placed
  at an angle extending from the neckline and thereby be hidden under a rever.
  When the curves at the back have been flattened through the use of shoulder
  pads, the ease may be &quot;worked in&quot; at the point and then, through
  steam pressing over a curved pad, the wool fabric would mold into a soft curve.
  But when a fabric is used which will not respond to steam and shrinking, the
  darts would be placed in any convenient position, dependent upon the design
  of the garment. <a href="mpd-02.html#75">See page 75</a>. The darts which would shape the hip length sloper
  at the waist are ignored just as was done in making the Dolman cape.</p>
<p class="clear"><em><strong><a href="illust/11-233-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',992,340);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/11-233-b-t.jpg" alt="Figures 2 through 4" width="66" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em><a name="padded" id="padded"></a>To achieve the &quot;boxy&quot; silhouette which provides extra room around
  the lower part of the <em>front</em> and <em>back</em> armscyes, a slash is made from hem to
  arm-scye as shown by points A and B, Fig. 3. When spread is completed, note
  the resulting change of <em>shape</em> in the armscye as shown in Fig. 4. But, because
  the boxy coat has little or no flare at the hemline, the extra width under
  the arm must be removed from the underarm seam as is shown by the broken lines
  in Fig. 3. If two thirds of the width is removed, this should produce a boxy
  silhouette of pleasing proportions. Note also that the normal shoulder seam
  has been raised to accommodate the thickness of the padding. It has also been
  moved outward. In such cases, it is necessary to measure the new armscye and
  actually fit in a muslin sleeve until it hangs correctly. The final pattern
  for the sleeve is then made accordingly.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><a name="swagger" id="swagger"></a><a href="illust/11-234.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',689,736);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/11-234-t.jpg" alt="Swagger type silhouette" width="187" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Swagger Type Silhouette</h3>
<p>Below is shown a typical &quot;swagger&quot; silhouette. Unlike the previous
  style, the full hemline is retained to provide movement in the silhouette.
  When cutting this pattern, it is very important to watch your proportions when
  sketching in the first divisional lines which form the panel and sleeve strap
  in the front and the yoke and sleeve strap in the back. See Fig. 2,
  showing arrangement of slopers and the spacing of these divisional lines. Broken
  lines A and B show place where flare will be introduced by slashing and spreading
  as shown in back section of Fig. 3. Amounts given produced a pleasing half
  size model which reached to within eleven inches of the table level. Flare
  added to center back seam will increase the movement throughout the back of
  the garment.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><a name="comboswagger" id="comboswagger"></a><strong><a href="illust/11-235.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',748,718);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/11-235-t.jpg" alt="Combination fitted and swagger silhouette" width="168" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>Combination Fitted and Swagger Silhouette</em></h3>
<p>Here you see the same design adapted to a combination silhouette which has
  a fitted front and a swagger back which is still more flared than in the previous
  diagrams. <a name="analysisvertical" id="analysisvertical"></a>Compare the Figs. 2 on these pages. <a name="seamedwaist" id="seamedwaist"></a>Note in the combination silhouette,
  this front divisional line forming the panel has been made to follow the line
  of the basic dart and then a slight flare has been introduced below the hip
  level. Two broken lines appear in the <a name="straight" id="straight"></a>straight back section to throw extra
  fullness in the back. Note distribution of this added fullness in back section
  of Fig. 3.</p>
<p>The belt slips through an opening left for that purpose in side seams. This
  gives the freedom to the swagger back and retains the front section in position.</p>
<p><a name="adapted" id="adapted"></a>Similar combination designs can be produced for the fitted front accompanied
  by the dolman or circular cape. (<a href="mpd-06.html#capevariations">See page
  140</a>.) Likewise, the tailored suit
  collar, reefer collar and others suited to outer garments may be drafted for
  coats. Methods for so doing would be as previously diagramed.</p>
<p><a name="specialized" id="specialized"></a>If the reader wishes to specialize in the field or women's coats and wraps,
  a brief apprenticeship to a tailor would teach him much about the technique
  in handling coat fabrics and the fine tricks used to interline the garment
  to prevent excessive stretching through the shoulders, &quot;staying&quot; the
  seams, et cetera. He should study coats for classification in silhouette, for
  their functional classification and for styling detail common to such types
  of garments.</p>
<p>In the opinion of the author, the field of coat design might be said to be
  the architectural phase of clothing design. When it has been mastered, it pays
  proportionate returns for the effort.</p>
<p>Fabrics used have their limitations. The methods used to cut and style them
smartly are singularly common to coat manufacturing.</p>

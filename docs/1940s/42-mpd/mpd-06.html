<h3><em><a name="origin" id="origin"></a>Analysis of Cape Slopers</em></h3>
<p>The modern cape is a direct descendent of the &quot;Toga&quot; worn by Romans
  in the early days. It comes and goes in fashion popularity but it seldom completely
  disappears from the fashion horizon. In fact, some women insist upon having
  a cape in their wardrobe because it is distinctly becoming to women having
  regal carriage. It is a favorite wrap of actresses and other individuals who
  have a dramatic personality. <a name="importance" id="importance"></a>When properly cut, the cape is beautiful and flattering,
  but when badly cut, it is ugly and unattractive. It is not the garment for
  timid, apologetic types of women who are short and round shouldered. To wear
  a cape well, the woman must wear it with confidence, safe in the assurance
  that it becomes her.</p>
<p><a name="analysis" id="analysis"></a>There are two basic silhouettes&#8212;the Dolman and the Circular. These two
  basic silhouettes or a combination of the two, form the basis for most cape
  designs. <a name="dolman" id="dolman"></a>The first produces a rectangular silhouette which hangs from the shoulders.
  <a name="circular" id="circular"></a>The second forms a triangular silhouette which widens like a tent at the base.
  The <em>length</em> of the cape is important to current fashion. A cape may
  reach to the level of the bust or extend down to the floor or at any point
  between these
  levels. When the cape does not entirely cover the dress, it is highly important
  which cape silhouette is selected to complement the ensemble. Selected clippings
  showing capes of various lengths and silhouettes should be collected and sorted
  according to the type of garment being worn beneath. This will give the design
  student a conception of the possibilities and limitations in using capes. It
  is also suggested that a study be made of the use of capes throughout the history
  of fashion. You will find it a most interesting study as well as a source of
  new ideas for modern cape designs. A collection of capes used for military
  wear or those found in certain native costumes should be in every student's
  personal reference library. </p>
<p>When capes are fashionable, many dresses are designed which suggest cape effects
  by loose circular sleeves, deep pleated flounces attached to shoulder yokes,
  et cetera. To be practical, such dresses must be worn under cape wraps or the
  sleeves would become mussed. In the autumn of 1941, the American designers
  offered many exquisite fur coat designs which were actually variations of the
  Dolman cape. Because that same autumn there was a revival of the Dolman shoulder,
  it was natural that the wraps should be designed to accommodate these new sleeves.</p>
<p>The two following sloper patterns&#8212;the Dolman and the Circular types&#8212;are
  all that are necessary to produce an unlimited number of cape designs having
  varying proportions. Necklines and collars used for dresses and coats are equally
  versatile in cape designs; pleats, yokes, shaping seams, or other garment features
  may be made a part of a cape design. The important factor is to provide the
  proper shaping over the bust and shoulders when it is needed in the capes having
  narrower silhouettes.</p>
<h3><em><a name="measurements" id="measurements"></a>How to Take Measurements for
  Capes</em></h3>
<p>It is more convenient to take all cape measurements to the floor. The finished
  length can then be estimated as being so many inches from the floor. That amount
  can then be subtracted from all vertical measurements.</p>
<p class="clear"><strong><em><a href="illust/06-136-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',473,162);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/06-136-a-t.jpg" alt="Figure 1" width="61" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>1. <em>Center Front Length</em>: Take from center front base of neck to floor.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. <em>Center Back Length</em>: Take from center back base of neck to floor.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. <em>Side Length</em>: Take from shoulder neck point, across shoulder, down over
  outside of arm to floor. See Fig. 1.</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. <em>Bust-Arm</em>: Take around arms and body in line with bust. See Fig. 1.</strong></p>
<p><strong>5. <em>Hip-Arm</em>: Take around arms and body in line with largest portion of hip.
  See Fig. 1.</strong></p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><a name="draftdolman" id="draftdolman"></a>Drafting the Dolman Cape</em></h3>
<p><em>Front Section</em>: <em><strong><a href="illust/06-136-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',335,150);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/06-136-b-t.jpg" alt="Dolman cape" width="83" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em>Plan for cape 20 inches from floor, for hip-length.</p>
<p><strong>1. Review instructions given in bodices and make draft shown in Fig. 2. Label
  as illustrated.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Extend center front line distance equal to <em>Center Front Cape
  Measurement</em>  less distance from floor. Label point 12.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Line A-10 is one-fourth of <em>Bust-Arm Measurement</em>. It is squared from center
  front line on level with point 8. In size 14, place point 10 two inches from
  point 8. (In standard sizes, it is assumed that <em>Bust-Arm Measurement</em> will exceed
  normal bust measurement by eight inches. Hence 2 inches is used here.)</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. Line 1-11 is one-fourth <em>Hip Arm Measurement</em>. It is squared
    from center front line on a level with point 9. (In standard sizes, it is
    assumed that
  the <em>Hip-Arm Measurement</em> should be 10 inches greater than the
  normal hip measurement. Hence, in a size 14, point 11 would be placed 2 1/2
  inches beyond 9.)</strong></p>
<p><strong>5. Square line from 12. Connect points 10, 11 and 13 with squared line from
  A to 10. Extend side seam line and shoulder seam line to intersect. Describe
  shoulder curve.</strong></p>
<p class="clear"><em><strong><a href="illust/06-137-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',501,364);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/06-137-a-t.jpg" alt="Figures 2 and 3" width="149" height="220" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>Back Section:</em></p>
<p><strong>1. Draw vertical guide line and place sloper against it as shown in Fig. 3.
  Trace around sloper and label points as illustrated.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Extend center back line 2-1 downward distance equal to <em>Back
  Cape Measurement</em>  less the desired distance from floor. Mark point 11.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Locate points 9 and 10 as you did in front section. Complete draft for
  the back and check side seam lengths of each section. Curved shoulder lines
  should be identical.</strong></p>
<p class="clear"><a name="controldolman" id="controldolman"></a><strong><em><a href="illust/06-137-c.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',175,310);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/06-137-c-t.jpg" alt="Figure 4" width="290" height="155" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em></strong>NOTE: Fig. 4 shows method of building up finished draft for insertion of padding
  to create broader shoulder appearance. The <em>Side Cape Length Measurement</em> is
  not used when making the Dolman cape except as a means of checking bulk of
  the dress when cape is being designed for an individual. It is an important
  measurement when drafting the circular cape shown below.</p>
<p>Maximum bust control must be placed at the shoulder to prevent cape sagging
  at side. Small back shoulder dart is also essential to good fit in that section.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><a name="draftcircular" id="draftcircular"></a><strong><a href="illust/06-137-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',282,201);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/06-137-b-t.jpg" alt="Figure 1" width="138" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>Drafting the Circular Cape</em></h3>
<p>The Circular cape offers more freedom to the wearer and is generally more
  becoming than the simple Dolman. This draft produces a garment which has a
  flat back and front with the circular fullness flaring from the shoulders.
  It is adaptable to varying lengths and when the basic side seams are eliminated
  and a center back seam used, it offers interesting ideas for layout of the
  fabric. Later problems will show methods used for removing some of the fullness
  or adding fullness to exaggerate the silhouette.</p>
<p>NOTE: Plan this draft to extend to the hip level. Take the <em>Front, Back
    </em>and<em> Side Cape Length Measurements</em> directly from your model
    form. Add 1/2 inch to the side measurement to allow for arm. Naturally, when
    the measurements are
  being taken from an individual, this extra allowance would not be added.</p>
<p>The waistline bodice sloper which has all control eliminated at the shoulder
  is the basis for this draft. As hip circumference measurements are not considered,
  the waistline bodice slopers are sufficient.</p>
<p class="clear"><strong><em><a href="illust/06-138.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',390,544);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/06-138-t.jpg" alt="Figure 2" width="283" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>1. Arrange slopers as illustrated. Trace and label.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Extend center front line A-B until it equals your planned <em>Center Front
  Measurement.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Extend center back line C-D until it equals your planned <em>Center Back Measurement.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>4. Extend shoulder line E-F until it equals your planned <em>Side
Length Measurement</em>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>5. Square guide lines from points 1, 2, and 3 to intersect at points 4 and
  5.</strong></p>
<p><strong>6. Connect points 4 and 5 with shoulder point F.</strong></p>
<p><strong>7. Locate points 6 and 7 the same distance from F that point 3 is from point
  F.</strong></p>
<p><strong>8. Connect 1, 7, 3, 6, and 2 with a sweeping circular line. Mark notches on
  seam line F-3.</strong></p>
<p>The small shoulder dart is retained at the back neckline. This <em>could</em> be removed
  by folding and slashing upward from lower edge to dart point. But, this would
  throw extra folds up to the shoulder blades which might cause the wearer to
  appear round shouldered. It is for this reason that many circular cape designs
  provide for a round, square or pointed yoke which shifts the shoulder control
  into the seam and permits further degree of flare being added below the yoke
  as desired.</p>
<p>This simple draft is particularly adaptable to short capes which extend only
  to the waistline. It provides plenty of room for movement of the arms and retains
  the contour of the flat back and shoulders of the wearer.</p>
<p>Following are interesting adaptations of this Circular and also the Dolman
  cape which produce exaggerated silhouettes that are influenced by fashion of
  the season.</p>
<p>When muslins are made for these two drafts, compare them carefully from all
  angles while they are draped on the model form.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><a name="methods" id="methods"></a><strong><a href="illust/06-139-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',312,729);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/06-139-a-t.jpg" alt="Variations of dolman and circular capes" width="486" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>Variations of Dolman and Circular Capes</em></h3>
<p>The above adaptation of the Dolman draft is a cape which was typical between
  1935 and 1940 when the silhouettes of the dresses were emphasizing bulk through
  the shoulders. The puffed shoulder of the cape reflected the current silhouette
  and also provided ample room for the sleeve of the garment being worn beneath.
  Note that a small amount of width was added at the side seams and then these
  two sections were assembled to eliminate the side seam, leaving a remaining
  shoulder dart.</p>
<p class="clear"><a name="fabrics" id="fabrics"></a><em><strong><a href="illust/06-139-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',418,726);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/06-139-b-t.jpg" alt="Variations of dolman and circular capes" width="355" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em>Below we have a youthful style of cape which might be made of taffeta or net
  to accompany an evening gown. Some of the flare at the side has been folded
  out up to the yoke edge, which extends to the shoulder tip (A, B and C).</p>
<p>When the sweep of the lower edge has been thus established, the gathers which
  are to appear at the yoke are introduced by slashing and spreading the pattern.</p>
<h3><a name="capevariations" id="capevariations"></a>CAPE VARIATIONS</h3>
<p class="clear">Silhouettes, <em><strong><a href="illust/06-140.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',758,744);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/06-140-t.jpg" alt="Variations of dolman and circular capes" width="350" height="356" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em>lengths, fullness and necklines of capes may show wide variation.
  Though essentially classified as a wrap to be used instead of a coat, the variety
  of fabric is not especially limited either. Many of the basic principles of
  pattern making which you have studied in these previous pages may easily be
  applied in the designing of capes. As a medium for combining fur and fabric,
  or as a decorative accessory to a garment, opportunities for design interest
  are quite unlimited.</p>
<p class="clear"><a name="scarves" id="scarves"></a><strong>TIES, SCARVES, BOWS AND JABOTS</strong></p>
<p><em><a name="cravat" id="cravat"></a><strong><a href="illust/06-141-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',226,307);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/06-141-a-t.jpg" alt="Cravat" width="244" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>Cravat</em> (Figure 1): Although it is
  commonly believed that the cravat is of English origin, research proves that
  it was
  first worn by the middle class Dutchmen in about the year
  1660. Shortly after that, it became generally popular with both the English
  and the French. By that time, it appeared with many elaborations of lace and
  brocade and was favored by gentlemen of the court. The modern adaptation of
  the cravat is about 21 inches long and 9 inches wide with slight shaping in
the center. It is tied in a simple overhand knot with ends spread.</p>
<p class="clear"><a name="windsor" id="windsor"></a><em>Windsor <strong><a href="illust/06-141-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',425,359);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/06-141-b-t.jpg" alt="Windsor tie" width="167" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>Tie</em> (Figure
  2)<em>:</em> This
  soft bow tie was popular in this country in about 1860 by men who wished to
  be recognized for their
  tendency towards Bohemian-ism. It is about 45 inches
in length, cut on true bias and is finished at 7 inches
  width.</p>
<p class="clear"><a name="four" id="four"></a><em><strong><a href="illust/06-141-c.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',164,194);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/06-141-c-t.jpg" alt="Four-in-hand" width="174" height="144" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>Four-in-Hand</em> (Figure 3)<em>:</em> This
    tie is conventional for men and is worn by women as an accessory to riding
    apparel.
    In accompanying diagram,
    dotted lines show the fabric and heavy lines
show interlining. The small tabs are the partial linings to be made of satin.</p>
<p class="clear"><em><a name="stock" id="stock"></a><strong><a href="illust/06-141-d.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',164,194);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/06-141-d-t.jpg" alt="Stock collar" width="283" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>Stock Collar </em>(Figure 4): This standing
  collar with attached
  cravat was originally just the collar portion at the time the Ascot was in
  fashion for men. Later the
  tabs were added and for many years during the period between 1750 and 1850
  it was the popular neck dress for men and for riding habits for women. Today,
  the standing collar with the tabs and the scarf are cut in one piece and are
  used as an accessory to formal riding apparel for both men and women. The small
  slit in the center back permits passing an end through to eliminate bulk and
  when tied in an overhand, the wide ends complete the appearance of the cravat.
  In some instances, it is confused with the English Ascot due to the similarity
  in appearance when worn. It is the true English Ascot which is worn by men
  as an accompaniment for formal morning attire.</p>
<h3><a name="bows" id="bows"></a>Bows in Fashion</h3>
<p>To some women, the mere suggestion of a bow being used on a dress would suggest
  dowdiness and would meet with their immediate refusal of such an idea. Yet,
  some of the more smartly dressed, sophisticated women wear garments which include
  the use of a single bow, or a series of bows. The question is not the use of
  a bow, but what sort of bow which should be used for the type of garment or
  the type of woman.</p>
<p>Milliners soon become aware that the art of tying a bow is an important factor
  in creating trimmings for hats. There are several factors to be considered
  when using a bow for trimming. First, the finished effect desired is dependent
  upon the fabric which will be used. The bow which is to give a youthful effect
  cannot be made from too pliable a fabric or ribbon. Artificial stiffening would
  only give a stilted effect. Second, the age of the wearer of the garment. Third,
  the size of the wearer. A large woman will not benefit from a soft, bulky,
  youthful French bow, while a trim, tailored bow of the right size to scale
  with her size, might give the impression of trimness which her clothes need.</p>
<p class="clear"><a name="bowanalysis" id="bowanalysis"></a><em><strong><a href="illust/06-142-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',185,163);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/06-142-a-t.jpg" alt="Shoe-string tie" width="143" height="165" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em>Fig. 1 shows the popular <a name="shoestring" id="shoestring"></a>&quot;shoe-string&quot; type, made from either a
  bias or straight tubing, with finished ends, pressed flat. It is usually best
  to make the strip and then use an additional piece to simulate the knot. It
  may be tacked together and it may be then quickly ripped apart for laundering
  and assembled again.</p>
<p class="clear"><em><strong><a href="illust/06-142-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',352,189);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/06-142-b-t.jpg" alt="Tailored bow" width="102" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em>Fig. 2 shows another variation for a tailored bow used in a similar manner.
  It is like the bow-tie men wear with dinner jackets, cut and shaped, or it
  may be made in sections with the idea of saving material.</p>
<p class="clear"><a name="boxy" id="boxy"></a><em><strong><a href="illust/06-142-c.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',240,158);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/06-142-c-t.jpg" alt="Boxy bow" width="125" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em>Fig. 3 shows the &quot;boxy&quot; bow resembling the &quot;shoe-string&quot; style
  which is often made from grosgrain ribbon. A series of such tailored bows,
  properly spaced at intervals down the front of an otherwise simple dress can
  create a slenderizing effect without creating a &quot;fussy&quot; appearance.</p>
<p class="clear"><a name="french" id="french"></a><em><strong><a href="illust/06-143-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',283,300);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/06-143-a-t.jpg" alt="French bow" width="186" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em>The semi-soft, &quot;French&quot; bow is frankly youthful. It might be made
  in sections, from scraps of leftover material, or from a straight piece of
  fabric or crisp ribbon which ties easily. For the thin, angular woman, a series
  of these nicely proportioned bows would give a little added bulk without being
  too youthful. Observe how it gives the evening gown a youthful feeling when
  used with a sash. Fig. 4.</p>
<p class="clear"><a name="scarfbow" id="scarfbow"></a><em><strong><a href="illust/06-143-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',245,136);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/06-143-b-t.jpg" alt="Scarf bow" width="103" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em>Fig. 5 shows the third classification
  of bows. We shall call it the &quot;scarf&quot; bow
  because it becomes more of a scarf than a bow as it is so soft that it has
  a droopy, scarf-like effect. You can readily visualize how such an effect,
  when seen on a child's dress, is despondent and unattractive. That is because
  this bow might be said to be glamorous, and mature appearing. Yet, when it
  appears on a sophisticated evening gown of chiffon, or a negligee, it suggests
  dignity and can be a very pleasing addition. Naturally, the effect is achieved
  through the use of a very soft velvet or chiffon.</p>
<p>Start <em>now</em> to clip illustrations showing the clever use of bows in garment
  design. Become intelligently &quot;bow conscious.&quot; Divide your clippings
  into the three basic classifications and paste them on extra sheets. You will
  find this research most enlightening!</p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><a name="jabot" id="jabot"></a>Detachable and<strong><a href="illust/06-143-c.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',251,361);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/06-143-c-t.jpg" alt="Detached jabot" width="258" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong> Attached Jabots</em></h3>
<p>The modern jabot (pronounced Zha-bo) is the outgrowth of the cravat which
  became elaborately decorated with ruffles and lace. Today it is no longer found
  in the men's wardrobes but is an accessory to women's garments. Like bows,
  the jabot may be limp and lacy or it may be crisp and trim. Its appearance
  and character are dependent upon the fabric and trimming.</p>
<p class="clear"><em><strong><a href="illust/06-143-d.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',241,376);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/06-143-d-t.jpg" alt="Attached jabot" width="282" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em>The accompanying illustrations show the method used for producing pleasing
  jabots. The first step is to get a construction pattern of the general outline.
  Then the ripples are introduced through slashing and spreading. When a series
  of ripples are to appear, (Fig. 7), the section containing the design for them
  is slashed all in one piece and then the pattern for each section is traced
  off separately.</p>
<p>Ample hem and seam allowance is then added. This will produce a cascade of
  circular ruffles all of which will have identical ripples which follow a line
  downward. This eliminates a confusion of meaningless ripples and will produce
  a more attractive finished jabot.</p>
<h3><em><a name="revers" id="revers"></a>Detachable and Attached Revers</em></h3>
<p class="clear"><em><strong><a href="illust/06-144-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',445,333);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/06-144-a-t.jpg" alt="Detachable revers" width="147" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em>Fig. 8: Horizontal slashes produce horizontal ripples in jabot. This style
  better suited to crisp fabrics.</p>
<p class="clear"><em><strong><a href="illust/06-144-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',435,433);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/06-144-b-t.jpg" alt="Detachable revers" width="174" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em>Fig. 9: Slashes must merge at center front neck point. This style also suited
  to soft fabrics as well as crisp ones.</p>
<p>The fact should not be overlooked that the neckwear manufacturing industry,
  as an accessory to the entire garment industry, stands in a class by itself.
  Manufacturers of dresses and suits purchase thousands of finished pieces of
  neckwear which are applied to their garments. Then, the neckwear designer also
  alertly follows the prevailing changes in necklines as they appear from season
  to season in order that she may offer a wide choice of new, interesting designs
  which will reach the consumer through the counters of the department stores
  and specialty shops. Neckwear designing requires a specific talent for fine
  details. The writer has observed, in teaching students who are preparing for
  careers in the field of fashion, that individual students may reveal a marked
  aptitude for this single field of designing. Neckwear is an important part
  of every business woman's wardrobe and thousands of dollars are invested yearly
  for these dainty bits of lingerie that will give the up-to-the-minute look
to some basic dress that is being mustered into service for a second season.</p>

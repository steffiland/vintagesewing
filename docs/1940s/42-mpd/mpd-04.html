<h3><em><a name="analysis" id="analysis"></a>Analysis for Need of Control</em></h3>
<p>In previous chapters you have learned the value of the use of basic control
    in shaping the bodice patterns. In the study of sleeves in which you are
    now engaged, you will learn that this same principle is utilized to provide
    as close a fit as possible with no lack of freedom.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illust/04-89-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',465,154);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/04-89-a-t.jpg" alt="Figure 1" width="60" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Fig. 1 shows the natural shape of the human arm. In addition to being cylindrical
    in shape, it is also naturally bent at the elbow and tapers at the wrist.
    This means that the back of the arm will require additional fabric because
    it is <em>longer</em> than the front. So we provide that extra length in that area
    with the aid of the dart from the elbow position to the outer edge of the
    pattern.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illust/04-89-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',263,141);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/04-89-b-t.jpg" alt="Figure 2" width="100" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Fig. 2 shows another important point in shaping a pattern for the sleeve.
    Where the arm joins the body (see point A), there is a rounded curve for
    which some control must of course be provided. As this curve is not intense,
    and extends from the front over the shoulder to the back, it is best handled
    with gathers, or &quot;ease&quot; through that area. In some style sleeves,
    this curve is accented, and additional fullness is provided, but for the
    time being, we are merely interested in the simple, basic set-in sleeve.
    Various sleeve designs follow later.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illust/04-90.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',398,212);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/04-90-t.jpg" alt="Figure 3" width="102" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig3" id="fig3"></a>Fig. 3 shows how the flat pattern should look to provide proper length where
    needed. The fabric must enclose the curved arm and it must also permit movement
    at the elbow and shoulder. Intersecting lines A-B and F-E are grain lines.
    Notches are placed at A and B so one automatically records the position of
    this grain line when tracing around the sloper. The horizontal grain line
    F-E intersects at right angles and rests at base of sleeve cap.</p>
  <p>The front folding line (broken line) indicates where the fabric will rest
    at the front of the arm when sleeve is being worn. Point P, at the lower
    point of this dotted line falls at the base of thumb as shown in Fig. 1.</p>
  <p>The back folding line (broken line) represents the back of the sleeve, when
    it is on the arm. Point O, which is the point of the dart, indicates the
    elbow position. Point Q falls at little finger position as shown in Fig.
    1.</p>
  <p>The lines E-X and Y-U must equal the opposite side, F-T because, when the
    dart has been folded in, they must meet in a seam.</p>
  <p>Point A at the top of sleeve cap joins the normal shoulder seam of the bodice
    and serves as a dividing point for distribution of ease in sleeve cap. In
    standard sizes the average amount of ease is 1 1/2 inches. Usually it is
    equally divided on each side of A. As individuals vary at this point, seam
    allowance
    should be generous to permit alterations. When an individual sloper is being
    fitted, the curved lines 2-A and 3-A are established in the final pattern
    <em>after</em> a trial fitting in muslin. Points 2 and 3 are usually located
    6 inches from side seam in the bodice. They are then established in the sleeve
    pattern
    by measuring 6 inches <em>upward</em> from points F and E on the sleeve cap.
    When the sleeve is set&#8212;that portion is fitted smoothly to the bodice
    armscye. The excess from 2 to A and A to 3 is then adjusted in gathers to
    control
    the smooth fitting of the arm curve.</p>
  <p>The seam of this simple sleeve falls in direct line with the underarm seam
    of the bodice. In our grandmother's day, most sleeves were so shaped as to
    place the seam to the front, permitting a closer fit through the biceps.
    However, modern women want more freedom and this sleeve is simpler to use
    in factory production, so is preferred today.</p>
  <h3><em>Drafting the Sleeve Sloper</em></h3>
  <p>Turn back to your bodice measurement chart on <a href="mpd-02.html#measurements">page 59</a> to find the sleeve
    measurements given for standard size 16. These may be used to study the method
    of procedure used for making a sleeve draft. It is advisable to read over
    the directions first, mentally completing each step before drawing any lines.
    Check over the following measurement points and the description given for
  each so that you may visualize the use of each when making a draft.</p>
  <h3><em><a name="locate" id="locate"></a>Measurement Points</em></h3>
  <p>The measurements given for sleeve drafts are based upon the ideally proportioned
    arm. They are the result of research work done by pattern makers in the manufacturing
    industry. The same method would be used to measure an individual.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illust/04-91.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',466,310);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/04-91-t.jpg" alt="Figure 1" width="130" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="91" id="91"></a>Fig. 1 shows the basic points from which measurements are taken. These would
    be established by marking with chalk. They are, namely:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A&#8212;Shoulder Tip Point </li>
    <li> B&#8212;Armpit </li>
    <li> C&#8212;Inside Wrist</li>
    <li> D&#8212;Back of Wrist, or Little Finger Position. </li>
    <li> E&#8212;Elbow Point (Used particularly when measuring individuals.)</li>
  </ul>
  <h3><a name="where" id="where"></a><em>Where Measurements are Taken</em></h3>
  <p>Fig. 2 shows just where measurements are taken. Notice that you have two
    vertical and two horizontal measurements. These are all that are needed to
    produce the draft for a standard size sleeve sloper.</p>
  <p>1. <em>Overarm Measurement</em>: Taken from the Shoulder Tip Point, over the Elbow
    Point and down to the back of the wrist or Little Finger position. Arm should
    be bent as illustrated.</p>
  <p>2. <em>Underarm Measurement</em>: This measurement is taken from the armpit to the
    wrist, with the arm hanging naturally.</p>
  <p>3. <em>Biceps Measurement</em>: Taken in a position in line with the armpit.
    In standard sizes two inches have been added to provide some ease. When measuring
    individuals
    the arm may be measured exactly and then two inches added to the literal
    biceps measurement.</p>
  <p>4. <em>Wrist Measurement</em>: Taken around the wrist exactly over the wrist joint.
    One inch is usually added to the exact wrist measurement to provide normal
    ease.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a name="draft" id="draft"></a><a href="illust/04-92.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',651,345);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/04-92-t.jpg" alt="Sleeve sloper" width="103" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>Read Each Step Carefully</em></p>
  <p>Select a piece of pattern paper 28 X 24 inches.</p>
  <p>Have your square, tapeline, ruler, sharpened pencil and curve at hand.</p>
  <p>Jot down the four basic measurements given for size 16 sleeve.</p>
  <p>A-B&#8212;Start one inch below top edge of your pattern paper and draw the vertical
    line A-B down the center of the sheet. Make this line equal to the <em>Overarm
    Length</em>. Label points A and B.</p>
  <p>B-C&#8212;From point B, measure upward a distance on this line equal to the <em>Underarm
    Length</em> and mark this point C.</p>
  <p>D&#8212;Divide the line C-B equally and place a dot. Locate point D one-half
    inch above that dot.</p>
  <p>C-E&#8212;From point C, square a line right which is equal to <em>one-half Biceps
    Measurement</em>. Label E.</p>
  <p>C-F&#8212;From point C, square a line left which is equal to <em>one-half Biceps
      Measurement</em>.
    Label F.</p>
  <p>F-C&#8212;plus C-E equals entire <em>Biceps Measurement</em>.</p>
  <p>F-G&#8212;From point F, measure off a distance equal to one-fourth of line F-C
    and label point G.</p>
  <p>E-H&#8212;From point E, measure off a distance equal to <em>one-half</em> line
    F-G. Label point H.</p>
  <p>A-I&#8212;From point A on line A-C, square a line right equal to combined lengths
    of F-G and E-H. Label point I. Connect points I and H.</p>
  <p>A-J&#8212;From point A, square a line left equal to twice length of line F-G.
    Mark point J. Connect points J and G.</p>
  <p>D-K&#8212;From point D, square line right which is equal to C-E less 1/2 inch.
    Label point K.</p>
  <p>D-L&#8212;From point D, square a line left which is equal to C-F less 1/2 inch.
    Label point L.</p>
  <p>NOTE: The combined amounts deducted in the last two steps reduces the elbow
    one inch as compared to the biceps. This reduction is for the normal arm
    and might vary with individuals.</p>
  <p>F-L&#8212;Connect points F and L. </p>
  <p>E-K&#8212;Connect points E and K.</p>
  <p>M&#8212;From point B, square a line to the right 1/2 inch long and mark this
    point M.</p>
  <p>M-N&#8212;From point M, square a guide line downward which is 4 inches long.
    Label point N.</p>
  <p>O&#8212;Divide the line D-K equally in halves and label point O.</p>
  <p>M-P&#8212;From point M, extend the line M-B to the left a distance equal to <em>one
    half</em> the <em>Wrist Measurement</em> and mark that point P.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illust/04-92-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',414,292);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/04-92-b-t.jpg" alt="Figure 1" width="138" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Q&#8212;Place your square on the points O and P as illustrated in Fig. 1. The
    corner of the square must rest somewhere on the line M-N. Place a dot at
    the exact corner of the square and label that dot Q.</p>
  <p>Q-P&#8212;Connect points Q and P. </p>
  <p>Q-O&#8212;Connect points Q and O.</p>
  <p>R&#8212;Divide the line Q-P equally in half and mark the point R.</p>
  <p>R-S is a guide line. Make it seven inches long, and make it parallel to
    line M-P.</p>
  <p>P-T&#8212;From point P, measure a line equal to P-R to fall somewhere on the
    guide line. R-S. Mark point T.</p>
  <p>L-T&#8212;Connect points L and T.</p>
  <p>Q-U&#8212;Extend the line P-Q to the right, an amount equal to the distance
    from Q to R. Label point U.</p>
  <p>K-U&#8212;Connect points K and U.</p>
  <p>V&#8212;Subtract the length of the line F-L-T from the length of the line E-K-U.
    The difference represents the dart appearing at the elbow for control. Starting
    from K, measure off this distance and label point V.</p>
  <p>O-V&#8212;Connect points O and V.</p>
  <p>NOTE: When making sleeve drafts for various sizes from standard measurements,
    the difference in the biceps and wrist measurements may cause F-L-T to have
    an outward curve. It makes a more shapely sleeve if this seam is straight.
    This may be easily accomplished by straightening the line and then adding
    the amount which was lost to the back of the sleeve where the dart is located.
    The dotted lines in the diagram on the previous page illustrate the steps
    which follow.</p>
  <p>W&#8212;Connect points F and T with a straight line. Label point W at the new
    intersection point.</p>
  <p> X&#8212;Extend the elbow line W-O-K an amount equal to the distance between
    L and W. Label point X. Connect points E and X.</p>
  <p>Y&#8212;Extend the line O-V until it is equal to the line O-X. Label point Y.
    Connect points Y and U.</p>
  <p>The intersection of lines between X and Y represents the center of the dart.</p>
  <h3><em><a name="cap" id="cap"></a>Shaping the Sleeve Cap</em></h3>
  <p>You are now ready to shape the sleeve cap. In placing point J a greater
    distance from point A than point I was located from A, it results in a rounder
    curve at the front of the sleeve cap than that at the back of the sleeve.
    Some pattern makers make the two curves&#8212;front and back&#8212;identical.
    However, making an equal distribution requires more alterations when fitting
    sleeves to individuals. It is recommended that the proportion illustrated
    be used when making basic draft in standard sizes.</p>
  <p><em>Read Each Step Carefully</em></p>
  <p>Points 1, 2, 3 and 4 which appear on the sleeve draft are merely guide points
    for establishing a shapely, proportionate sleeve cap for standard size garments.</p>
  <p>G-1&#8212;From point G, measure off a distance on the line G-J which is equal
    to the length of the line F-G. Label point 1.</p>
  <p>J-2&#8212;From point J, on the line J-G, measure downward a distance which is
    equal to the length of the line J-A. Mark that point 2.</p>
  <p>1-3&#8212;From point I, on the line I-H, measure downward a distance equal to
    the distance between A-I. Mark that point 3.</p>
  <p>H-4&#8212;From point H, on the line H-I, measure upward a distance equal to
    the line H-E. Mark that point 4.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illust/04-93.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',241,359);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/04-93-t.jpg" alt="Figure 1" width="268" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>With the aid of your curve, placed in the positions illustrated in Fig.
    1, establish clear, clean, curved lines between F and 1; 2 and the line J-A;
    E and 4; 3 and the line A-I. The top of the cap can follow the line J-I in
    the area of point A. It is not a good plan to make the top center of the
    cap too curved as the shoulder joint is a round shape and the width is needed
    around the top of the cap. Soften wrist with curve from T to R.</p>
  <p>With blue pencil, trace around draft:</p>
  <p>A-3-4-E-X-0-Y-U-Q-R-T-W-F-1-2-A.</p>
  <p>Check your draft over carefully before allowing seams as given on next page.</p>
  <p>Seam allowances for standard size sleeves are usually 3/4 inch on the sides
    and cap and 1/4 inch at wrist edge.</p>
  <p>Some garment manufacturers allow extra seam allowance from 2 to A to 3 to
    provide for adjusting the length of the sleeve caps when alterations are
    necessary in stores. This is usually done in suits and better grade dresses.</p>
  <p>Your cardboard sloper should be labeled as shown in <a href="#fig3">Fig.
      3, page 90</a>. Make
    certain that the biceps and elbow lines are at right angles to the grain
    line and that each is labeled properly.</p>
  <h3><em><a name="points" id="points"></a>Personal Sleeve Slopers</em></h3>
  <p>When making a sleeve sloper for an individual, in most cases you will find,
    by checking the four measurements, that she will closely resemble some standard
    size which will conform to the size dress she would buy. By a few simple
    alterations, her sleeve sloper can be made. Unless the woman has an arm which
    is abnormal in shape because of certain flesh deposits, most alterations
    will be simple. When customers have abnormal bone structure, such as an extra
    long upper arm and a normal lower arm, or just the opposite, then the full
    set of measurements should be taken and a special draft made to those personal
    measurements. Usually, she will tell you her troubles with ready-to-wear
    garments and that will help you to decide the proper steps to take.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illust/04-94.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',389,349);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/04-94-t.jpg" alt="Figures 1 and 2" width="156" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>As in the case of making a bodice sloper, the muslin should be properly
    prepared before fitting is started. A blue vertical line should plainly mark
    the vertical grain line and another blue line should mark the horizontal
    grain line. See Fig. 1. Allow a full inch or more for seams and possible
    adjustments which may be necessary. The sleeve should be pinned together
    as shown in Fig. 2. In most cases, the designer is fitting the customer to
    a bodice at the same time as the sleeve. When the bodice has been properly
    fitted, the sleeve should be tested. Obviously, it would be impractical to
    attempt to fit a sleeve without the bodice muslin.</p>
  <p>Points A and B are marked on the muslin proof with a single blue straight
    line in front and two lines in the back at a point 6 inches upward from the
    side seam of the bodice and a like position on the sleeve. (The area below
    A and B should be without ease.) In some cases, you will find that as much
    as 7 inches can be smooth, depending upon the amount of flesh deposit around
    the shoulder joint. It is best to make these points as high as possible and
    still maintain a good fit. It results in a smarter looking sleeve.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illust/04-94-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',247,254);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/04-94-b-t.jpg" alt="Figures 3 and 4" width="180" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Figures 1 &amp; 2 show the sleeve muslin prepared for fitting. Figures 3 &amp; 4
    show how the bodice armscye should be prepared to receive the sleeve. To
    make the curved edge of the armscye fold back smoothly, short slashes should
    be snipped at about one inch intervals. Points A and B should be marked with
    a straight blue line.</p>
  <p> There are two special points of fitting a sleeve:</p>
  <p>1. The sleeve cap, to permit freedom of the shoulder joint.</p>
  <p>2. The elbow control, to permit freedom to bend the arm regardless of the
    shoulder.</p>
  <p>The sleeve cap must be long enough to provide a smooth fit without excess
    fabric, but it must not be droopy. It must also be wide enough to actually
    enclose the entire arm, because if it is too narrow, it will stretch the
    bodice and not permit the entire garment to be comfortable.</p>
  <p>More discomfort can result from improperly fitted sleeves than any other
    portion of a garment. Few dressmakers thoroughly understand just what constitutes
    a truly well fitting sleeve. Each of the above factors is considered individually
    and one has little to do with the other.</p>

  <p>Your customer's arm should hang relaxed throughout this procedure, as far
    as possible.</p>
  <p>Slip the sleeve muslin over the arm as shown in Fig. 1. Note that horizontal
    grain line is on a true horizontal. Likewise, the vertical grain line will
    be in a truly vertical position. Fig. 2 shows a common error found in hanging
    sleeves. This tips the sleeve too much to the back and will result in droopiness
    at the back of the cap when the arm hangs relaxed.</p>
  <p>With the sleeve in the position shown in Fig. 1, pin it into that position
    temporarily <em>regardless</em> of the position of the shoulder seam of the bodice
    with relation to the blue vertical grain line of the sleeve.</p>
  <p>Have customer raise her straight arm directly upward from the side and place
    a pin to attach the sleeve under the arm. Try and keep an equal portion of
    the biceps ease to the front and back when placing this pin.</p>
  <p>Starting at the armpit, slip the raw edge of the sleeve cap under the folded
    edge of the armscye, removing the first pins as you insert the new ones.
    Fit the sleeve into the armscye smoothly up to, or beyond points A and B
    until the curve of the arm shows the need of ease.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illust/04-95-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',443,371);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/04-95-b-t.jpg" alt="Figures 3 through 6" width="145" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig3" id="fig3"></a>Gently
    smooth the upper cap into the armscye, working in the direction shown by
    the arrows in Fig. 3. <em>Keep customer's arm relaxed at side!</em> You
    may note that, due to bone structure, or distribution of the flesh in upper
    arm, more
    fullness is needed to front than at back half of sleeve cap. Use some of
    the seam allowance of sleeve, if necessary, to provide a smooth, shapely
    cap. As you proceed, your muslin should look like that shown in Fig. 4.</p>
  <p>Fig. 5 shows how it will look if you have pushed the cap in too much. Fig.
    6 shows how it looks if sleeve cap is too long. Such errors result in complete
    loss of style in the garment.</p>
  <p>So far, you have been fitting only the <em>sleeve cap</em> and the arm has
    been in the relaxed position. To test the width of the cap for muscular activity
    such as reaching, car driving, et cetera, place your hand on the other side
    of the bodice armscye in line with shoulder blades and ask your customer
    to keep her arm <em>straight</em>, but lift it forward. If you feel too tight
    a strain across the shoulders, widen the sleeve cap in the vicinity of point
    B. A
    very small amount, such as 1/8 inch may prove sufficient to provide the necessary
    ease with no loss in the smartness in fit.</p>
  <p>Your next step is to check for sufficient elbow control to permit freedom
    of the arm itself. This is an entirely separate procedure from fitting the
    cap and checking the reaching width mentioned above.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illust/04-96.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',593,368);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/04-96-t.jpg" alt="Figures 7 through 10" width="121" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>With upper arm close to her side,</em> have customer bend her elbow
    as seen in Fig. 7. Watch shoulder area as she does this. If it draws, as
    shown
    by arrows,
    either the elbow dart is not exactly over the elbow, or there is not a large
    enough dart to provide sufficient control. If the sleeve just binds at the
    elbow, just release the seam in elbow area and test once more.</p>
  <p>To increase elbow control, remove pins from wrist to elbow dart. Work the
    back of sleeve up gently, and re-pin seam and test again. When sufficient
    amount has been added, she should be able to bend her arm without causing
    the back of bodice to strain. Fig. 9 shows how corrected sleeve would appear.
    Dotted line shows original stitching line. Amount lacking at wrist shows
    amount added to elbow dart. Pin on a little piece of muslin and mark the
    new wrist line in red.</p>
  <p>Modern factory methods require that sleeves have seams which fall in a true
    line with the underarm bodice seam in the basic slopers. Check the muslin
    on your customer and if necessary, correct the position of the underarm seam
    as shown in Fig. 10. Make a similar check at the shoulder and correct, if
    necessary, as shown in Fig. 3 on the previous page. These new basic seam
    positions should be marked in red pencil.</p>
  <h3><em>Completing Personal Sloper</em></h3>
  <p>Customer's sloper will now be made from this muslin fitting of bodice and
    sleeve. Remove muslin from customer with sleeve still pinned into position.
    Mark position of points A and B across armscye seam on bodice and sleeve
    with red pencil. This locates position of notches in patterns. Go over all
    darts, seams and other basic points with red pencil. If correction is made
    as shown in Fig. 10, &quot;true&quot; up all red sketched lines and cut bodice
    apart <em>on red lines</em>, leaving original seams still pinned. Cut away
    all excess remaining seam allowance outside of your red lines. Cut away dart
    areas.
    Press muslin without stretching. Pin muslin down to a piece of cardboard.
    Mark all grain lines and other identifying marks, such as notches, darts,
    et cetera, just as they appear in <a href="#fig3">Fig. 3</a>. Write customer's name
    and date fitting was made. This personal sloper may be the basis for all
    garments made for her in the future.</p>
  <p>Students in classes like to test the perfection of any personal sloper by
    making an inexpensive, or muslin blouse which involves additional style features,
    such as added drapery, yokes et cetera. This might be a good plan until you
    have had experience in fitting several customers.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illust/04-97-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',396,361);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/04-97-a-t.jpg" alt="Figures 11 and 12" width="159" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Fig. 11 shows a high style garment showing the use of a simple, close fitting
    basic sleeve. The ease which was provided above points A and B has been steamed
    out at the seam and the cap fits closely, yet provides the smartest possible
    fit.</p>
  <p>Fig. 12 shows two supplementary measurements which may be taken on individuals.
    B is taken with arm closely bent to test required width provided by line
    L-K. A locates elbow height, or actual distance of point D from B on basic
    draft shown on <a href="#91">page 91</a>. These additional measurements can reduce need for
    muslin adjustments.</p>
  <h3 class="clear">Variations of Elbow Control</h3>
  <p class="clear"><a href="illust/04-97-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',256,654);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/04-97-b-t.jpg" alt="Variations of elbow control" width="500" height="186" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></p>
  <p class="clear">The ease provided at the top of the sleeve cap, where it will meet the armscye
    of the garment is slight enough, in most fabrics, to be steamed out over
    a round pad in the final garment. When the fashionable silhouette calls for
    an exaggerated width at top of the sleeve, darts, gathers and seams are employed
    and extra length and width are inserted to produce the exaggerated silhouette.
    This will be illustrated in following diagrams.</p>
  <p>As you found to be the case in the study of bodices, the basic control dart
    in the sloper must extend to the highest point of the curve being fitted.
    This is also true with regard to the elbow dart. But,
    it is equally true that the dart may be shortened in the final garment to
    provide
    extra
    elbow
    room as needed. The basic dart may also be replaced by several small short
    darts or gathers. Diagrams on this and previous page show method for making
    such changes.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illust/04-98-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',252,208);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/04-98-a-t.jpg" alt="Variations of elbow control" width="142" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>You will notice that many ready-to-wear dresses show the elbow dart merely
    folded over without being stitched. The reason for this is obvious. Although
    the method does not produce a sleek, well fitted sleeve, it makes it more
    possible for many women to wear the dress without alterations. In higher
    priced garments, where expert cut and fit is expected, the darts are usually
    stitched into position but ample seam allowance is provided so that proper
    alterations may be made as needed.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><em><a name="folded" id="folded"></a>The Folded Sloper</em></h3>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illust/04-98-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',343,734);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/04-98-b-t.jpg" alt="Folded sloper" width="442" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em></p>
  <p class="clear">Another convenient supplementary sloper is made of brown kraft paper, with
    the control at the elbow. This is then folded in such manner as to appear
    as a fabric sleeve would when hanging on the figure. In other words, this
    new sloper when folded, represents the <em>silhouette</em> of the fitted sleeve. This
    sloper will prove most convenient when planning sleeves with width at the
    back and below the elbow. It provides speed in developing such patterns.
    Carefully study the diagrams shown above before proceeding.</p>
  <p>Make a tracing of the elbow control sloper and cut out of heavy paper. Be
    sure the grain line is in place, with the biceps and elbow lines at right
    angles to it. Study carefully steps 1, 2, 3, and 4 as illustrated above.
    The shaded areas represent the under side of the sloper.</p>
  <p><strong>Step 1: Fold front of the sleeve pattern over to the grain line,
      so that the biceps remains at a perfect right angle to the grain line.
      Note this
    makes the front of the sleeve parallel to grain line.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Step 2: Fold area above elbow dart over to the grain line&#8212;again
      keeping the biceps at right angles to the grain line. Result: The back
      fold, down
    as far as the elbow, is parallel to grain line.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Step 3: Fold over remaining portion of sleeve below elbow dart so as to
    have lower wrist points meet. (Sections of the sleeve on either side of elbow
    dart may overlap at that point.)</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Step 4: Unfold sloper and label front and back fold as illustrated. These
    folds represent the true front and back to the sleeve. Place one notch at
    the top of the front fold, two notches at the top of the back fold.</strong></p>
  <h3 class="clear"><em><a name="shifting" id="shifting"></a>Shifting Control to Little Finger Position</em></h3>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illust/04-99.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',325,699);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/04-99-t.jpg" alt="Shifting control to little finger position" width="445" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em></p>
  <p class="clear">As is the case in bodices, the basic control in sleeves may be shifted to
    another position and the sleeve still retain the original dimensions. A position
    which is preferred by many designers is that which starts at the wrist, at
    the back, in line with the little finger on the hand. Although the dart is
    longer than the elbow dart, it is the same size at a point equidistant from
    the elbow control point.</p>
  <p>In the drawings above you will see illustrations showing the procedure used
    to shift the control to this little finger position. Note that when the control
    is at the elbow, the portion below the elbow dart is somewhat off grain.
    When the control is shifted to the wrist, the grain of the fabric in the
    back section straightens somewhat. Therefore, when a woman has a large biceps
    and elbow measurement and a small wrist and requires a generous amount of
    control, sleeves made with the little finger dart or with the control divided
    between the elbow and little finger position will be more shapely and comfortable
    to wear.</p>
  <p>NOTE: Naturally, the seam allowances in the wrist dart will depend upon
    the manner of closing the sleeve. If the placket is to be placed at the back
    of the arm (where it is most pleasing in appearance), the allowance would
    be made accordingly. If the placket is to be in the basic sleeve seam on
    the <em>inside</em> of the arm, then it would be provided accordingly.</p>
  <p>As you complete your sleeve muslins, pin them up against the model form
    by attaching the tip of the sleeve cap to the shoulder seam line. Every muslin
    should be traced to show the vertical and horizontal grain lines. Study the
    effect closely. It will be of great help in recognizing faults of sleeves
    in finished garments. It is important that you keep in mind which part of
    the pattern is front, and which is the back, as you will study sleeves from
    the profile point of view more than from the front or back view.</p>
  <p>By this time, you can readily see the convenience of having a sleeve sloper
    which provides for control at the little finger position. This should be
    made of cardboard from the construction pattern of the previous design. It
    should be notched and labeled in a similar manner to the original sloper
    having elbow control.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><em><a name="variations" id="variations"></a>Variations of Little Finger
  Control</em></h3>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illust/04-100.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',370,785);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/04-100-t.jpg" alt="Variations of little finger control" width="383" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em></p>
  <p class="clear">The following illustrations show the many possibilities for originating
    new designs from the &quot;little finger control&quot; sloper. Observe that
    the new designs are all created in the wrist and dart area.</p>
  <p>Fig. 1 has tabs added. Seam allowance on the final pattern would depend
    upon the designer's decision regarding the actual closing of the sleeve.</p>
  <p>Fig. 2 produces a design that includes a pointed shape at the <em>top</em> of the
    wrist. The dart has been shortened to provide more ease in the elbow area.</p>
  <p>Fig. 3 shows the simple basic dart shaped gently. Note that the button-holes
    are placed to bring the sleeve together at the original sloper wrist measurement.
    Cuff links would give a little additional freedom at the wrist.</p>
  <p>In these designs, the focal point of interest lies between the elbow and
    the wrist. In general, the silhouettes are practically identical. When the
    long, close fitting sleeve is a fashion favorite, the clever designer continues
    to produce fresh, interesting varieties of detail so the finished garments
    will have greater appeal. Each new design is produced from the same sloper,
    which represents the fashionable sleeve silhouette of that year.</p>
  <h3><em><a name="coat" id="coat"></a>Analysis of Coat Sleeves</em></h3>
  <p>If you will inspect garments found in shops, you will notice that certain
    types of sleeves are common to certain types of garments. Current fashions
    change, but certain basic sleeve silhouettes are used for certain <em>basic</em> garments.
    Dress sleeves may have a tight fit at the wrist and a placket provided. Suit
    jackets, coats, bathrobes and certain similar garments usually have sleeves
  which eliminate the need for a placket as it would prove to be a nuisance.</p>
  <p>When a sleeve is fitted tightly at the wrist and there is no &quot;play&quot; at
    that point, it is <em>absolutely essential</em> that control be provided for comfort
    in wearing. If this control is too scanty, it will affect the fit and comfort
    of the entire bodice. But, when the wrist is loose, and the arm bends, the
    sleeve will slide up a little and permit such arm motion without the need
    of so much control. Many coat type sleeves are so constructed. One piece &quot;coat
    type&quot; sleeves appear in dresses occasionally.</p>
  <p>Coat type sleeves may be roughly classified into three basic types, all
    three of which provide, for less fit at the wrist. They are:</p>
  <p>FIG. 1. The semi-fitted one-piece sleeve. </p>
  <p>FIG. 2. The straight one-piece
      sleeve. </p>
  <p>FIG. 3. The two-piece semi-fitted sleeve.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><em><a name="semi" id="semi"></a><a href="illust/04-101-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',433,347);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/04-101-a-t.jpg" alt="Semi-fitted coat sleeve" width="158" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>Semi-Fitted Coat Sleeve</em></h3>
  <p>The accompanying diagram (Fig. 1) shows the procedure used to produce the
    semi-fitted sleeve for use in jackets, dresses, coats, bathrobes or other
    garments which are more convenient if the wrist is larger. The control is
    partially shifted to the wrist, by partially closing the elbow dart and then
    slashing from the wrist. The lower edge is properly shaped and the remaining
    control at the elbow is handled in the usual manner.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><em><a name="straight" id="straight"></a>Straight Coat Sleeve Eliminating Control</em></h3>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illust/04-101-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',454,349);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/04-101-b-t.jpg" alt="Figures 2 and 3" width="152" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>The method used for making the straight, one piece coat sleeve employs the
    use of the sloper in a folded position. Although the pattern might be made
    by using the flat sloper, this problem offers an excellent opportunity of
    clearly demonstrating the use of this folded sloper method which is so practical
    in making many following sleeve patterns.</p>
  <p>Fig. 7 shows the finished pattern for the straight coat sleeve. Note that
    the biceps and lower edge of the sleeve are the same width, the seam edges
    falling parallel to the vertical grain line. Note the front of the sleeve
    retains the actual front length of the sloper, while a slight curve at the
    back adds a graceful note to the design. Many sleeves made in factories are
    cut off straight at the wrist, to reduce production costs.</p>
  <p>Carefully study the following illustrations to visualize the procedure.
    Work directly on final pattern paper as this method requires no construction
    pattern to be made.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illust/04-102.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',351,1008);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/04-102-t.jpg" alt="Figures 1 through 7" width="500" height="168" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em></p>
  <p class="clear"><a name="102" id="102"></a>1. Trace around <em>folded</em> block as shown in Fig. 1 and mark position of horizontal

    up pattern and go over tracing with pencil. Fig. 6. Complete pattern and

  <h3><em><a name="twopiece" id="twopiece"></a>Two-Piece Coat Sleeve</em></h3>
  <p>Turn back to <a href="#straight">Fig. 3, page 101</a>, and study the illustration of the conventional
    two-piece coat sleeve. Notice that it has seams at both the front and back
    of the arm, the under section being somewhat smaller than the top, thus making
    the seams less conspicuous. Men's suit coat sleeves are usually cut from
    this type pattern.</p>
  <p>The first step in preparation for making a two-pieced pattern from the simple,
    one-pieced sloper is to properly fold it to provide added width at the wrist.</p>
  <p class="clear"><a name="105" id="105"></a><em><a href="illust/04-103.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',396,398);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/04-103-t.jpg" alt="Figures 1 through 3" width="140" height="139" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Fig. 1 shows the folded dress sleeve sloper as you have used it so far.
    The two edges are brought closely together to maintain the actual wrist dimension.
    In later diagrams which involve making deep cuff designs, you will see the
    reason for this.</p>
  <p>Fig. 2 shows how the sloper should be folded at the lower back section to
    provide extra wrist width, which is a functional feature of a coat sleeve.</p>
  <p>Refold the lower back section in such manner as to bring the edges of the
    dart together, without over-lapping. Crease in a new fold so that the pattern
    edges are parallel from the elbow down to the wrist as illustrated in Fig.
    2. This might vary slightly when using a personal sloper which might have
    a large elbow and a small wrist. The pattern would be merely folded to provide
    the desired wrist dimension.</p>
  <p>Trace around your sloper as you did in previous instructions. Also mark
    in the position of the elbow as it is labeled on your sloper. (Line G-H)</p>
  <p>Label your drawing as illustrated in Fig. 3 on this page.</p>
  <p>The two-piece sleeve pattern merely provides that the normal underarm seam
    used in the one-piece sleeve be eliminated and two shaped seams be used instead.
    However, these seams are not located exactly at the front and back but are
    made to fall partially out of sight by cutting the top portion slightly wider
    than the under section (<a href="#105">see Figs. 1 &amp; 2, page 105</a>).</p>
  <p>By increasing the wrist measurement as explained above, you have established
    the proportions of the silhouette. The following instructions demonstrate
    the method for properly placing the two new seams and eliminating the original
    underarm seam. Because the seams fall in the right position to do so, they
    also absorb the control furnished by the elbow dart in the original sloper.</p>
  <p>K&#8212;Divide line F-C in half and mark point K.</p>
  <p>L&#8212;From point G on the line G-D, measure off 1 inch. Mark point L.</p>
  <p>M&#8212;From point I on line I-B, measure off 3/4 inch and mark point M.</p>
  <p>K-L-M&#8212;Connect points K-L-M with solid line.</p>
  <p> N&#8212;Divide line E-C in half and
      mark point N.</p>
  <p>O&#8212;From point H on line H-D, measure off 1/2 inch and mark point O.</p>
  <p>P&#8212;From point J on line J-H, measure off 4 inches and mark point P.</p>
  <p>N-O-P&#8212;Connect points N-O-P with broken line.</p>
  <p>Measure the space appearing at the elbow between the edges of your folded
    sloper. Jot down that measurement.</p>
  <p>Q&#8212;From point L on the line L-D, measure off a distance equal to one half
    the above amount and mark point Q.</p>
  <p>K-Q-M&#8212;Connect points K-Q-M with a broken line.</p>
  <p>R&#8212;From point L, on the line L-G, measure off the remaining amount of that
    same amount and mark point R.</p>
  <p>K-R-M&#8212;Connect points K-R-M with a broken line.</p>
  <p>Fold your pattern paper under on the line F-G-I and trace as follows: I-M-R-K-F.
    Unfold pattern. See dotted line on diagram.</p>
  <p>S-T-U&#8212;Mark points S-T-U.</p>
  <p>V-W&#8212;Fold paper under on the line E-H and trace as follows: H-Q-N-E. Unfold
    pattern and see dotted line. Mark points V and W.</p>
  <p>X&#8212;Fold paper under along the line H-P and trace from P to O to H. Unfold
    and see dotted line. Label point X. Connect points X and W.</p>
  <p>The above tracing processes completed the larger section of your sleeve
    pattern. You are now ready to trace off the smaller, under-section of the
    pattern.
    This is done by placing a second piece of pattern paper directly under your
    draft
    and pinning the two pieces together firmly to prevent slipping.</p>
  <p>Trace as follows: M-Q-K-C-N-O-P-J-B-M.</p>
  <p>Trace grain lines and elbow line Q-O.</p>
  <p>Remove the under paper and observe your tracing. Turn it over and mark perforated
    lines with blue pencil.</p>
  <p>With blue pencil, mark the outline of the upper section appearing on your

    of 6 inches from points S, V, U, J, N, J, M, K. The area between the notches
    on the back of the top section will be slightly greater than that of the
    back of the lower section. This is due to the tiny amount of control which
    remained between points W and X in Fig. 4 on the previous page. This would
    be gently eased in when sewing the muslin together at that point.</p>
  <p>Dotted lines in Figs. 1 and 2 show how original lines would be softened
    in the final pattern when the muslin test is made. However, when using the
    cardboard sloper as the basis of problems which will follow later, it is
    more convenient to have straight lines. </p>

    Fig. 4 on previous page) would be dependent upon the desired elbow width
    for the garment being designed. These steps present the method only. </p>

  <p>The bishop sleeve reveals its origin in its name. It was a type of sleeve
    found in the robes of ancient priests. To the present day it is the conventional
    type found in religious vestments. It rises in fashion favor from time to
    time and is a favorite choice of theatrical designers for dramatic costumes.
    It is also frequently used for costumes for glee clubs, choirs and it has
    become a classic in negligee and hostess gowns.</p>
  <p>The chief characteristic of the bishop sleeve silhouette is the bulk or &quot;movement&quot; at
    the back of the arm only. In a later lesson, you will study the cut of the &quot;bell&quot; sleeve
    which resembles the bishop sleeve somewhat but produces an entirely different
    silhouette.</p>
  <p>Follow the same procedure used in making the straight coat sleeve. Amount
    added at back is dependent upon fabric. When sleeve is to be confined in
    close fitting cuff, the new back line 3-U must equal or exceed original back
    line 3-O-J to permit freedom for bending arm.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><em><a name="foldedsloper" id="foldedsloper"></a><a href="illust/04-106-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',382,320);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/04-106-b-t.jpg" alt="Figure 3" width="145" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>Folded Sloper Variations and Methods</em></h3>
  <p><a name="straight" id="straight"></a>Any number of sleeve designs can be developed from a single basic sleeve
    silhouette. Some seasons the silhouette may favor width at the top of the
    sleeve. In another, the sleeves have width at the lower edge, or at the elbow.
    Once a pleasing basic sleeve has been produced, it may be faced, piped and
    trimmed in countless ways. Once you have an understanding of the method used
    to produce some silhouette, you can start originating ingenious sleeves,
    which, incidentally, can provide the major style interest in any garment.
    High style clothes, such as dinner gowns, negligee, lounging pajamas, et
    cetera, offer endless possibility for the use of interesting sleeves.</p>
  <p>Provide for a closing in this sleeve as you believe it should be constructed
    in final garment.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><em><a name="simulated" id="simulated"></a><a href="illust/04-106-c.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',369,375);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/04-106-c-t.jpg" alt="Figure 4" width="178" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>Simulated Cuffs</em></h3>
  <p>In the study of bodice cuts, you learned how to make the simulated yoke.
    Here we find the simulated cuff. For relationship in an entire garment, this
    sleeve could be used with a bodice employing the use of a simulated yoke
    or plastron (<a href="mpd-01.html#simulatedyoke">page 40</a>).</p>
  <p>The back line 3-U is first established and should equal 3-O-K to permit
    bending the arm. Pattern is folded on back sleeve line 3-U, traced and opened.
    Then pattern is folded on line K-J and the cuff portion traced.</p>
  <p>It becomes apparent, due to the fact that you are working your design closer
    to wrist than elbow, that the line 3-U is limited in length although it could
    be extended gently from L to U to form a larger pouch in the finished sleeve.</p>
  <p>As was the case in using this principle in bodices, a small amount must
    be pinched out for the seam which tapers to nothing at point E. In many cases,
    you will observe such sleeves having trimming covering the seam, such as
    insertion, braiding, et cetera. Occasionally a designer will combine lace
    and fabric and because there is a piecing seam introduced further up on the
    sleeve, she can add more length to the back and produce an exaggerated pouch
    as desired. The notch is placed at U to show where the back portion will
    meet center back point K when sleeve is being constructed. Hence, the fabric
    from E to U must be gathered into the cuff portion E-K.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><em><a name="fitted" id="fitted"></a><a href="illust/04-107-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',374,370);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/04-107-a-t.jpg" alt="Figure 5" width="173" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>Three Quarter Length Sleeves with Cuffs</em></h3>
  <p>This design produces a sleeve which has a one-piece cuff which extends around
    the wrist to a closing at the little finger position. Such cuffs are more
    difficult to attach and are therefore usually found only in higher priced
    garments. In some cases they are imitated in the lower priced garments but
    there is a seam in the cuff on the under side of the wrist to meet seam at
    sleeve portion (at K-B). This permits assembling the garments with the sleeves
    flat as they would be in many other simple styles.</p>
  <p>If the cuff is traced off on a second piece of paper that eliminates the
    need for tracing off the upper portion, as that first tracing may be used
    for the final pattern. Seam allowances are added and lines forming cuff can
    be ignored.</p>
  <p>In this style of sleeve, the puff at the back may be exaggerated as desired
    by lengthening the back line 3-U and widening sleeve proportionately.</p>
  <p>The close fitting cuff with the exaggerated silhouette becomes a flattering
    sleeve, for it suggests that the wearer has a small hand and slender wrist.
    Many interesting new shapes of cuffs may be used and when a combination of
    fabrics are used, such as lace and chiffon, further interest may be developed.
    Through the styling of the garment, a wide variety of designs may be produced
    from a single pattern.</p>
  <h3><em><a name="adaptation" id="adaptation"></a>Adaptations of the Coat Sleeve Sloper</em></h3>
  <p>The simple, straight coat sleeve pattern (<a href="#102">page 102</a>) is used as the basis
    for unlimited designs of coat and dress sleeves. Designers who use the straight
    coat sleeve for functional reasons&#8212;as coat designers would&#8212;utilize
    every possible idea for working up new sleeve designs all of which will
    adhere to the basic silhouette of the foundation pattern.</p>
  <p>This can be done in countless ways, and once the designer has experimented
    a little, she will find it simple and easy. Some of her designs may create
    the interest on the top of the arm and others may emphasize the back of the
    wrist to elbow area.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illust/04-107-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',372,335);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/04-107-b-t.jpg" alt="Figure 1" width="157" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Fig. 1 on previous page shows a basic coat sleeve silhouette divided into
    sections which create a line of interest down the top of the arm. Because
    the original sloper provides a dip at the little finger, she has reduced
    that curve because diagonal lines are the dominant design interest. When
    the sleeve is worn, it will <em>appear</em> to be straight across the bottom. If it
    were to be three-quarter length or &quot;bracelet&quot; length, it could
    be cut straight, but when it reaches the wrist, the straight lower edge appears
    awkward.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illust/04-108-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',379,319);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/04-108-a-t.jpg" alt="Figure 2" width="146" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Fig. 2 shows the coat sleeve as it might be used by a blouse designer. The
    original length is left at the back, and, if anything, might be increased
    slightly. The ruffle portion is merely an extension. Because the band will
    hold the sleeve firmly about the wrist, it requires ample length at the back
    to permit bending the arm. An excessive amount of added length, however,
    would produce an awkward looking sleeve as the extra length must be dependent
    upon the widened silhouette as you learned in the previous problems employing
    that principle.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illust/04-108-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',386,296);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/04-108-b-t.jpg" alt="Figure 3" width="140" height="186" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Fig. 3 shows the same basic pattern used for the simple shirt sleeve. The
    amount the tuck shortens the sleeve equals the amount planned for the width
    of the straight cuff. A small amount extra has been added at the back to
    give the sleeve a generous appearance when the arm is relaxed at the side.
    (This is the mark of a good shirt waist blouse!) The cuff is planned to close
    at the back with a tailored button closing.</p>
  <h3><em>Bell Sleeves</em></h3>
  <p>The bell sleeve is slightly different from the sleeves you have made which
    add the bulk of silhouette at the back only. It derives its name from the
    silhouette which is produced. The bishop sleeve produced a silhouette which
    added little weight from a front view of the figure. The bell sleeve is slashed
    to produce bulk <em>around</em> the arm, with an increased amount being placed at
    the top and back. (If too much bulk were placed under the arm, it would be
    awkward to wear.)</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illust/04-109-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',367,690);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/04-109-a-t.jpg" alt="Bell sleeves" width="338" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Before slashing and spreading the pattern, the final pattern paper should
    be prepared with vertical and horizontal guide lines. These are a convenient
    means of judging the proportionate amount of bulk which will appear in the
    finished sleeve.</p>
  <p>The front point P retains its original length given in the sloper. Points
    S and R will be of equal distance from the biceps line. Because a slight
    amount of extra length is added at B in proportion to width being added,
    B should
    be dropped <em>slightly</em>.</p>
  <p>The above sleeve could be pushed up on the arm and held in place with an
    elastic band.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illust/04-109-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',390,752);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/04-109-b-t.jpg" alt="Figure 1" width="396" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>The lower sleeve has a shaped cuff cut to fit the middle of the lower arm.
    It is supported at point P which is kept at original length. The puff is
    then added to the remainder of the sleeve. Points R and S should be of equal
    distance from biceps line. B is slightly lower or may be equal. Because seam
    edges on folded sloper don't quite meet, cuff pattern can be adjusted to
    fit tightly upon arm by reducing it accordingly.</p>
  <h3><em><a name="puffed" id="puffed"></a>Various Types of Short Puffed Sleeves</em></h3>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illust/04-110.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',654,624);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/04-110-t.jpg" alt="Figure 3&#8212;puffed sleeve variations" width="450" height="472" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em></p>
  <p class="clear">The short puffed sleeve has a youthful character in appearance so it is
    the choice for children and young girls or mature women having youthful proportions.
    The sleeves you have just been studying provided for extra bulk being emphasized
    at the back, of the arm to conform to the shape of the arm itself. When fullness
    is being added above the elbow, the more pleasing effect is achieved by making
    the center of the sleeve the center of interest. There might be a few exceptions,
    but in most cases, the statement is correct. Therefore, the highest point
    of the added curve is at the vertical grainline.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illust/04-111.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',432,599);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/04-111-t.jpg" alt="Figures 1 through 3" width="246" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Study the three following silhouettes. Fig. 1 introduces bulk at the lower
    edge only and, when viewed from the front, adds width to the silhouette on
    a level with the bust. This would be true whether a cuff is used or not.
    Fig. 2 produces a feeling of width at the shoulder and on a level with the
    bust, or just above it. Fig. 3 invites the eye to the shoulder level only.
    By contrast, the exposed arm below will appear to take on a slimmer appearance.
    Hence, this single sleeve is best suited to the mature woman who has a plump
    upper arm.</p>
  <p>To achieve an even, round silhouette in the puff, it is necessary to proportion
    the added length to the amount of added width. If sleeve is widened 3 inches,
    the build up should be at least 1 inch. After trial patterns have been made,
    it is advisable to jot down proportions which produced your conception of
    a pleasing silhouette. Naturally, a fabric
    must be used which has enough &quot;body&quot; to sustain the silhouette.
    A well cut puff will neither &quot;break&quot; nor &quot;droop&quot; when
    worn. Half way between elbow and base of armscye is a good proportionate
    length. A shorter length is childish and a longer one, unless it extends
    below the elbow, is awkward looking.</p>
  <p>NOTE: The perfection of many sleeve patterns is done in the final muslin.
    In manufacturing plants, they are tested upon individuals for appearance
    and comfort for movement of the arms. These diagrams will give you the key
    to the procedure and it is to be expected that final changes will be made
    as they are needed for the proportions being used by the individual student
    of pattern making.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><em><a name="mutton" id="mutton"></a>Leg<a href="illust/04-112.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',451,920);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/04-112-t.jpg" alt="Figures 4 through 8" width="365" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>-Of-Mutton Variations</em></h3>
  <p>At some future date, when you study Costume History, you will recognize
    many of the following types of sleeves, with their varying degrees of bulk
    in silhouette, to have an interesting historic background dating back to
    the early 17th century. As space prevents further details about the origin,
    you will study and compare the procedure used for each and will observe and
    compare the silhouettes in the finished muslin proofs.</p>
  <p>Although this pattern shows the use of the little finger control sloper,
    either one might be used. The
    vertical row of buttons exaggerates the slim lower arm in comparison with
    the wide silhouette at the shoulder.</p>
  <p>Note that slashes are made in the outer part of sleeve only. The extra length
    appearing at elbow aids in supplying plenty of length. The amount added at
    shoulder point or top of cap must be dependent upon amount of width introduced.</p>
  <p>Note that first slash at point 3 could be made to absorb normal elbow control
    if desired. As illustrated here, however, grain line is the same at front
    and back of sleeve.</p>
  <p>This silhouette differs from that illustrated on the previous page in that
    a round, melon-like puff appears throughout the cap area but the remainder
    of the sleeve is closely fitted to give further emphasis on the exaggerated
    silhouette. It is therefore necessary to slash in such manner as to avoid
    widening the remainder of the sleeve.</p>
  <p>Compare the diagrams showing the procedure used in each. Notice that width
    starts from the elbow in the sleeve on <a href="#mutton">page 111</a> but in this design, the underarm
    seam takes on a curved line, which, when sewed and fabric snipped, will straighten
    and then force the silhouette bulk outward from the arm.</p>
  <p>Slash and spread the sections until your pattern assumes similar proportions
    to that shown in the diagram.</p>
  <p>Obviously, this same pattern could be produced from a little finger control
    sloper. And for the sake of design, a seam might be introduced and a similar
    silhouette produced with the upper area slashed as desired to seam.</p>
  <p>In the two previous leg-of-mutton styles, the biceps measurement was increased.
    Compare this style with them and note the different patterns produced for
    each. This style, when viewed from the profile, should be long and slim and
    an exaggerated height shown in the cap portion. From the front and back view,
    it adds no bulk to the shoulder area, but merely adds height to the wearer.
    The padding for this sleeve would be a round sausage-like roll set into the
    armscye and extending out into the sleeve portion only.</p>
  <p>During 1939, after several years of various types of the leg-of-mutton and
    various puffed sleeves, this sleeve became the forerunner to the &quot;molded
    shoulder&quot; of 1941. In the intervention, obvious gathers and drapery
    were gradually abandoned for shaping darts which aided in producing the exaggerated
    silhouette but dispensed with the appearance of bulk.</p>
  <p>As no balancing width is added to the biceps measurement, the degree of
    added height and width to the small cap portion must necessarily be limited.
    About
    2 1/2 inches extra length would probably be the limit in a size 14 sleeve.
    When the new point A is established, the line is then &quot;blended&quot; down
    through points 2 and 3.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><em><a name="novelty" id="novelty"></a><a href="illust/04-113.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',352,718);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/04-113-t.jpg" alt="Figures 1 and 2" width="420" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>Novelty Adaptations</em></h3>
  <p>Countless varieties of designs may be cut which maintain some popular silhouette
    of the present fashion. In the problems presented below are two illustrations,
    both of which give bulk and width at the shoulder. To analyze the procedure,
    consider the silhouette first. Then the construction pattern may be shaped,
    as in previous problems. The additional design interest may next be inserted
    as the sketch might show.</p>
  <p>Fig. 1 is a direct adaptation of the pattern produced for the third type
    of leg-of-mutton sleeves just discussed. Because the cap had already been
    lengthened and fullness introduced around the armscye, the sections were
    spread only at the seam provided in cutting the strap. If a more exaggerated
    amount of bulk were desired, an extension could be added to the area where
    sections were spread apart.</p>
  <p>Fig. 2 was developed from the average sleeve sloper. When completed, the &quot;boxy&quot; silhouette
    stood away from the shoulder seam smartly. Point A located one inch upward
    produced a pleasing silhouette.</p>
  <p>F-D-B and G-E-C fold in to make the silhouette. For practical reasons, combined
    measurement of B-A and A-C should not be more than 4 inches. This forms plain
    section on top of cap. Cap adjustments at 2 and 3 are dependent upon amount
    of extension at point A.</p>
  <h3><em><a name="circular" id="circular"></a>Circular Cut Novelty Sleeves</em></h3>
  <p>Occasionally, interesting new designs for sleeves are evolved from a single
    cutting principle. Many ingenious designs may be developed that are hard
    to copy and easy to produce.</p>
  <p><em><a href="illust/04-114-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',231,628);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/04-114-a-t.jpg" alt="Figure 1" width="500" height="174" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em></p>
  <p class="clear">Fig. 1 shows a novelty design for a sleeve that has a &quot;boxy&quot; silhouette
    with a single, horizontal shaping seam. Because the point of the sleeve is
    above the level of the armscye, there is no need for control; this is already
    provided in the basic sloper. The darkened area, A-B-C, shows how it has
    been removed. Point C represents the desired width of the sleeve &quot;yoke.&quot;</p>
  <p><a name="yokes" id="yokes"></a>To place the line 2-C-3 any lower would spoil the &quot;hang&quot; of the
    sleeve. When position of &quot;yoke&quot; line has been sketched and slashing
    lines marked, cut pattern apart on line 2-C-3. Fold in the dart A-B-C and
    pin securely. Slash and spread pattern as indicated, against a straight line.
    Now slash the lower portion and spread so that the sleeve will flare in shape
    as it meets the yoke. Distance E-F should be equal to G-H. Spread sections
    of lower portion until curved line 2-E-3 equals edge of &quot;yoke&quot; section
    where they meet in a seam.</p>
  <p><em><a href="illust/04-114-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',246,725);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/04-114-b-t.jpg" alt="Figure 2" width="500" height="160" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em></p>
  <p class="clear">The &quot;Chinese Lantern&quot; novelty sleeve, Fig. 2 below, has repeatedly
    appeared throughout the periods of fashion. Modern designers frequently adapt
    it in pleasing ways.</p>
  <p>Like the sleeve above, point C lies above armscye level A, which means that
    normal ease will be removed from this pattern also. To secure the pattern,
    make the tracing to a point halfway between base of sleeve cap and elbow.
    Make the three lower pieces from the one circular pattern. Spread upper section
    until edge E-C-F equals similar line E-C-F to which it attaches.</p>
  <p>Note how line E-C-F on the construction pattern follows the general line
    of the cap. Drawing it horizontally would lead to corrections in the final
    muslin proof. Dividing the pattern in half, as far as possible, results in
    a satisfactory muslin sleeve with little need for correction. This silhouette
    could be further exaggerated by extending the pattern sections at point C,
    making one balance the other. However, all such exaggeration in silhouette
    should be added only to the outside portion of the sleeve. The depth of the
    inside disks, towards the body, must be kept shallow to avoid excessive bulk.</p>
  <h3><em><a name="balanced" id="balanced"></a>Balanced Fullness</em></h3>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illust/04-115-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',441,680);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/04-115-a-t.jpg" alt="Balanced fullness in a sleeve" width="314" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>The use of balanced fullness in sleeves is identical with that used in bodices.
    When fashion favors the normal shoulder contour, usually bulk will appear
    at the wrist or elbow areas. This may be accomplished through the use of
    circular cuts studied in bell or peasant sleeves, or through the use of balanced
    fullness a similar silhouette can be produced in variation.</p>
  <p>Shirring, smocking or little pleats could be used to retain the natural
    contour of the shoulder area. Then the remaining bulk could be released at
    the elbow or any level desired.</p>
  <p>Clever designs are developed through the use of the small yoke in the cap
    area with added fullness introduced below it. Such fullness might be balanced
    or a circular cut.</p>
  <p><em><a href="illust/04-115-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',237,732);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/04-115-b-t.jpg" alt="Pleats over paper" width="500" height="152" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em></p>
  <p class="clear">When using pleats, a quick method is to pleat the paper first and then lay
    the sleeve pattern over it and make the tracing. When opened up, the notches
    can be placed according to the resulting irregular edge. As flat pleats cannot
    absorb basic control, the curve in the sleeve cap at armscye must be accomplished
    by adjusting pleats to absorb &quot;ease&quot; provided in sleeve sloper
    between 2 and 3. Note straightened seams under arm.</p>
  <h3><em>Novelty Sleeves</em></h3>
  <p><em><a href="illust/04-116-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',394,337);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/04-116-a-t.jpg" alt="Novelty sleeve" width="149" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>This style of draped sleeve is frequently used for wedding gowns, negligee
    or other garments having an emotional quality. Naturally, it is not the sleeve
    for the person having a plump arm. Gathers might be substituted with pin
    tucks or pleats et cetera to eliminate the silhouette bulk which appears
    when drapery is used.</p>
  <p>The area left by the elbow dart provides the space for spreading the sections
    and the wrist shaping appears on the top of the hand as shown in the diagram.</p>
  <p>Lace, soft velvet or satin and chiffon would be suitable for such a design.</p>
  <p><em><a href="illust/04-116-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',441,670);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/04-116-b-t.jpg" alt="Novelty sleeve" width="270" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>The unusual sleeve below dates back to the period of the French Renaissance
    and was revived again in the reign of Queen Elizabeth of England when it
    was successfully employed when stiff brocaded velvets were the fabric choice
    of the English court. It has been successfully employed in both daytime and
    evening wraps of modern times. Study the sketch and you will see that the
    largest area is at A-B seam. The other seams are merely decorative. Extra
    length is thrown to the center back at point C to make the sleeve curve to
    the arm.</p>
  <p>Desired width at the wrist is obtained by lapping the sections while spreading
    them. Proportions may be more easily judged by using vertical guide line.
    Added increase in length of back must be dependent upon amount added to width.
    When upper and lower halves are completed, they are cut apart to produce
    the secondary seams as illustrated. Seam allowances are then provided on
    each in the final pattern. When muslin has been tested for silhouette, sketch
    in vertical lines to study possibility for originating a second design on
    the same unusual silhouette.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illust/04-117-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',507,340);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/04-117-a-t.jpg" alt="Novelty sleeve" width="131" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>The sleeve below is merely a novelty variation of the third type of short
    puffed sleeve which was shortened and additional drapery added. As it has
    been emphasized repeatedly in this text, designers use every chance for adapting
    new detail in some accepted silhouette of the season. This is particularly
    true in skirts and sleeves.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illust/04-117-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',448,337);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/04-117-b-t.jpg" alt="Novelty sleeve" width="140" height="189" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>During 1939 and 1940, when the accepted fashion silhouette called for width
    at the shoulder but molded into form, many sleeves were designed which employed
    simple darts to manipulate the fabric around the shoulder. The best method
    proved to be to use a sleeve pattern which had previously provided for gathers
    and then, by working in the pattern, to shape the darts into position. When
    the satisfactory results were obtained the paper patterns were made from
    the muslins. The angle of the darts would determine the shape and in the
    final pattern, would assume irregular shapes. In producing this pattern,
    it is suggested that you employ that same method. Try arrangements of various
    types and compare the finished patterns.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><em><a name="cowl" id="cowl"></a><a href="illust/04-118-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',363,670);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/04-118-a-t.jpg" alt="Cowl sleeve" width="332" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>Cowl Sleeve</em></h3>
  <p>The cowl principle may be applied to sleeves and skirts with pleasing results.
    It produces a silhouette, in sleeves, which gives bulk just above the level
    of the bust. When introduced with a close form fitting bodice, it can serve
    as the focal point of design interest in the garment.</p>
  <p>Because the front and back of the sleeve are not identical, the best method
    for producing the cowl would be through the use of the slashing method. The
    dart A-B eliminates the ease provided in the original sleeve sloper. The
    length of that dart determined the &quot;neckline depth&quot; as it was explained in
    the bodice patterns. That may be made any length desired as is illustrated
    in the diagram for the following sleeve which is an adaptation of the cowl
    cut.</p>
  <p>The dart areas between the sections will become folds of fabric which will
    taper from points at the armscye. More fabric bulk might be added by raising
    point C above the horizontal guide line but the &quot;neckline&quot; would
    then be sewed up like a seam. </p>
  <p>The proportion shown here produces a pleasing
      sleeve and drapes better if cut on a true bias as indicated.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><em><a name="new" id="new"></a><a href="illust/04-118-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',306,730);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/04-118-b-t.jpg" alt="Novelty cowl sleeve" width="434" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>Variation of Cowl Sleeves</em></h3>
  <p>When normal ease has been removed between A and B and sections are in position
    shown in step 2, this pattern would produce a high, short cowl. When first
    pattern is finished, slashing and spreading the sections to allow for pleats
    prevents sleeve from falling into a drape, and maintains the oblong silhouette,
    emphasized by the horizontal folds of fabric. Make muslin (step 2) to see
    this.</p>
  <p>Variations of this effect can be produced from first cowl pattern (step
    2). Instead of folds of fabric, braid could be applied, or bias folds of
    contrasting fabric, which would support that section of the sleeve, and thus
    produce a similar silhouette.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><em><a href="illust/04-119-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',451,664);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/04-119-a-t.jpg" alt="Variations of two-pieced sleeves" width="261" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>Variations of Two Pieced Sleeves</em></h3>
  <p>Designers in suit and cloak manufacturing plants use their two-piece sleeve
    slopers as the basis for originating many interesting sleeves. Because even
    the simple two-pieced sleeve must be set into the garment in tubular form,
    the position of the seams in the final new design may be placed in any position
    desired.</p>
  <p>When fashion dictates bulk through the shoulders in dresses, coats assume
    a similar silhouette. This provides ample room for covering the dress sleeve
    and the woman is assured that her outer wraps reflect the current fashion
    as well as her dresses. You will see this illustrated in the design of capes
    also.</p>
  <p>The steps of procedure are quite simple:</p>
  <p><strong>1. Make a tracing of the top section of the two-piece sleeve sloper.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>2. Place the smaller underarm section of the sloper against the tracing
    as shown in Fig. 1. Trace around it as far as vertical center grain line.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>3. Turn the under portion of the sloper over, placing the opposite edge
    against the tracing as shown in Fig. 1. Trace around it as far as grain line.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>4. Build up the sleeve cap desired distance to produce 1 1/2 inch
      darts. Total sleeve cap measurement should finish to equal that of the
      original
      two-piece
    sloper less normal ease. (As sleeve stands away from the upper arm, it requires
    no control.)</strong></p>
  <p><strong>5. Cut away the two halves of lower section of new sleeve; restore them
    to normal position as shown (Fig. 2). Allow seams; cut pattern from muslin.</strong></p>
  <p>Such sleeves should be tested carefully in muslin. While pattern is on the
    table, it is hard to visualize how the darts will look when sleeve is set
    into armscye. Leave ample seam allowance around cap to facilitate later
    adjustments. (Drawing illustrates results of a muslin providing four darts;
    if three or five darts were used, dart angles would differ in each case.)</p>
  <p>NOTE: The new cap must measure equally to original sloper cap less the provided
    ease. This new sleeve must fit armscye of garment. Many styles of leg-of-mutton
    sleeves and other silhouettes of one-piece origin can be adapted from two-piece
    sloper with study and practice. &quot;Style&quot; sleeves produced in dressy
    coats are usually made from one piece sleeve patterns.</p>
  <p class="clear"><a name="variationsleeves" id="variationsleeves"></a><em><a href="illust/04-120.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',439,649);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/04-120-t.jpg" alt="Figures 1 through 3" width="263" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Many new sleeve designs may emerge when a basic silhouette produced in the
    previous problem has been perfected. The following sleeve was produced from
    the muslin of that pattern. Dotted line in first step shows desired position
    of new seam. With muslin still pinned, sketch in this line. Leave all original
    seams and darts pinned into position and cut the sleeve apart, starting at
    the wrist: F-E-C-O-D-A-G-E (Fig. 1). The top panel section should appear
    as shown in Fig. 2.</p>
  <p>Flatten the muslin, removing a few of the pins in the front seam as needed.</p>
  <p>Your remaining sleeve pattern should look like Fig. 3.</p>
  <p>Allow seams on both these new sections, after a paper pattern tracing has
    been made directly from the muslin. Reassemble and observe that, except for
    losing a little of the shaping around the elbow at the front of the sleeve,
    you have repeated the silhouette of the sleeve from which this pattern was
    made.</p>
  <p>NOTE: From this second muslin, produce another pattern which provides for
    gathers appearing in panel section only. An endless chain of new designs
    can be produced from one good basic style silhouette.</p>
  <p class="clear"> <em><a href="illust/04-121-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',417,728);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/04-121-a-t.jpg" alt="Variations on two-pieced sleeve" width="312" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>The designs on the following page might be developed from the two-pieced
      sleeve block at a time when fashion favored bulk of silhouette at the elbow.
      The first has a panel removed at the back which is represented by A-E-F-D.
      The remaining sleeve sections are then arranged to meet at normal front
    seam position and this seam is eliminated. A little of the curved fitting
    is lost
      in this procedure. The back panel is then slashed and spread and the pouch
      added. The original back seam of the sloper provides the closing at the
    little finger. The decorative seams need not follow the grain line. In fact,
    one
      of them could be eliminated. Can you do this in your final pattern?</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illust/04-121-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',426,728);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/04-121-b-t.jpg" alt="Variations on two-pieced sleeve" width="305" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>The sleeve design below provides for new seams to fall down the top of the
    arm and at the curved back of sleeve. It was successfully produced in a Persian
    lamb fur coat as the fur concealed the actual position of the seams and the
    tabs became the focal point of interest on the sleeve. To eliminate bulk,
    the tabs were lined with heavy satin and the buttons were of an interesting
    design in plastic material.</p>
  <p>Again, the seam on the top of the sleeve need not follow the grain line
    and you will note in the diagram that it has been swung forward slightly.
    It might have a very shallow curve to conform to the arm.</p>
  <p>The first step is to build on the curve at the back of upper and lower sections.
    Normal seam in front is then eliminated and slashing is completed in the
    new top of sleeve. Tabs are made by extending on at end of the sections which
  will produce the effect of pleats.</p>

<p>Up to this time, you have been making patterns which have extended only
    to the waistline. You have learned that the sloper can be the means to producing
    an almost limitless number of new designs, all of which are based upon but
    a few principles common to the block system of pattern making. The sloper,
    when made for an individual, is a pattern of that certain person's body contours.
    If the individual has a small waist and large bust, then her sloper will
    have an extra large basic dart because, for the size of her bust measurement,
    the fabric must be brought down to the size of her waist measurement. If
    she has sloping shoulders and a pronounced curve through the shoulders, the
    pattern must be carefully made to record such a fact. Then, as it will be
    used as the basis for creating designs for her, the designer may choose lines
    that will aid in concealing her bad proportions.</p>
  <p>People who have ideal or nearly ideal bodily proportions can wear garments
    that may be so very simple in form and line that they may be cut directly
    from a sloper. But if the customer has a body which is not one to be so revealed,
    her sloper pattern remains only a functional means to creating designs that
    involve drapery, divisional lines, etc. which will aid in hiding her bad
    proportions. The information set forth in these pages was originally based
    on normal figures. But it is now being successfully adapted to the designing
    for women of all sizes and shapes. It is to be assumed that the reader will
    use his judgment with each new customer.</p>
  <p>Your basic waistline control sloper may be the basis for making a hip-length
    jacket sloper.</p>
  <p>Designs which provide for <em>vertical</em> fitting around the waistline, without
    any seam at the waist, are adaptable to normally proportioned figures. Women
    who have too intense curves about the waistline must be fitted with garments
    which have:</p>
  <p><a name="partial" id="partial"></a>1. Partial waistline seams.</p>
  <p><a name="semi" id="semi"></a>2. Semi-fitted silhouette (to conceal irregular curves).</p>
  <p><a name="vertical" id="vertical"></a>3. Several vertical seams, or seams with additional vertical darts to provide
    opportunity for more shaping to the curves.</p>
  <p><em><a name="front" id="front"></a></em><em><a href="illust/03-80.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',357,148);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/03-80-t.jpg" alt="Figure 2" width="66" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>The first step in making the front hip-length sloper is to divide the bust
    control between the waistline and the shoulder. On some occasions, this simple
    hip-length sloper may be used in this simple form, but, you will find through
    the study of following problems, it is the basis for many other styles which
    produce a superior fit in finished garments.</p>
  <p>Label your <em>waistline</em> sloper as indicated above, making point A the center
    of the shoulder seam. Lay your sloper upon pattern paper and trace around
    it in the following manner:</p>
  <p>A to B; B to C; C to D; D to E.</p>
  <p>Holding the waistline sloper firmly in this position, place a dot halfway
    between points G and E. Trace along the side of dart E-F.</p>
  <p>Keep pencil point in position at the point of waistline dart and pivot your
    sloper to the <em>right</em> until the left side of the waistline dart falls upon
    the dot. With sloper in this position, trace:</p>
  <p>F to G; G to H; H to I; I to J; J to AA.</p>
  <p>Lift your sloper. The space between AA and A is the opening of the shoulder
    dart which has been shifted by partially closing the waistline dart. Connect
    A and A A with F. (Shorten both shoulder and waistline darts as indicated
    when using this pattern for an actual garment.)</p>
  <p>D-K&#8212;Extend line C-D downward equal to hip length (7 inches).</p>
  <p> K-L&#8212;Square a guide-line from D-K; K-L equals D-E plus 3/8 inch. Draw
    L-E.</p>
  <p> L-M&#8212;Extend K-L a distance equal to G-E. Label point M. Connect M and
    G.</p>
  <p>N is your side hip point. Use <em>one-half</em> front <em>Hip Measurement</em> of model form.
    From that, subtract length of K-L. Amount remaining must be M-N.</p>
  <p>Using tapeline and square, locate point N, 7 inches down from point H, the
    proper distance from M determined above. Curve lines H-N and M-N very slightly.</p>
  <p>The area enclosed by M-G-F-E-L is an &quot;open end&quot; dart extending
    to hip. Allow usual seam allowances and complete the pattern. Mark in position
    of normal waistline H-G-E-D on muslin as well as pattern as a guide when
    judging results. Front will be attached to back hip-length muslin produced
    in next page of instructions.</p>
  <p>NOTE: In standard sizes, Point N should be slightly higher than the level
    of point M as shown in the diagram. When making this hip-length jacket sloper
    for individuals, the heavier figures will require about two-thirds of the
    basic waistline control shifted up to the shoulder position. The extra slender
    figures may require only one-third shifted to the shoulder. This should then
    produce a finished jacket length sloper which will more closely resemble
    the standard sizes in the hip and waistline areas. The sloper will then be
    more adaptable for making the following styles of jackets.</p>
  <h3><em><a name="back" id="back"></a><a href="illust/03-81.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',362,374);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/03-81-t.jpg" alt="Drafting a back hip-length sloper" width="181" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>Drafting a Back Hip-Length Sloper</em></h3>
  <p>The back hip-length sloper is used in its original form as the basis for
    many jacket designs and full length garments. It is simple to construct and,
    if the darts are properly spaced for the individual wearer, it is becoming
    to most figure types.</p>
  <p>In order to keep the grain of the fabric on a true horizontal across the
    shoulders, a seam is thrown into the center back which might be handled like
    a dart if desired. This seam is shaped to conform to the curve of the back
    and then shapes outward again to accommodate the curve of the hips.</p>
  <p>Observe that the control is not changed at the waistline or the shoulders.
    The procedure merely includes the provision for a center back seam which
    will shape the fabric as needed at that point, and changes the position of
    the grain.</p>
  <p>1. Draw a vertical guide line at the left edge of paper.</p>
  <p>2. Place back bodice sloper in such a position as to make A rest upon guide
    line and B 5/8 inch from it.</p>
  <p>3. With sloper in that position, trace around it, including the darts. For
    convenience, label points B-C-D-E as shown.</p>
  <p>The hip section should be built on as follows:</p>
  <p>F&#8212;From point B, measure off a straight line 7 inches long to somewhere
    on the vertical guide line. Mark point F. Square a line right from guide
    line
    A-F. This is the tentative hip line.</p>
  <p>F-G&#8212;Along the hip guide line, measure off a distance equal to distance
    from B to C plus one inch. Label point G. Connect G and C; G and D to complete
    dart.</p>
  <p>G-H&#8212;Use <em>half</em> of back hip measurement. Subtract from that the
    distance from F to G. The remainder will be length of G-H. With aid of tape-line
    and
    square,
    locate point H 7 inches down from point E. Curve E-H slightly.</p>
  <p>Shorten both ends of dart slightly. If possible, make sides of dart equal.
    As waistline is abandoned in this type of garment, position of line D-E may
    be shifted if necessary to equalize sides of dart. (When this pattern is
    made for individuals having more than normal curves, this step may be impossible.
    Such figures would be fitted with aid of seam on line D-E and use panel effect
    down center back of jacket only.) <a href="#peplum">See page
    87</a>.</p>
  <p>Allow seams in usual manner including the center back, A-B-F. Cut muslin
    proof. Trace in position of waistline B-C-D-E. Pin this section with front
    section and test upon the model form.</p>
  <p>NOTE: As the grain of fabric is no longer parallel to center back seam A-B,
    but parallel to guide line, this means that the shaped center back seam does
    not follow grain of fabric. This change in grain of fabric straightens grain
    at underarm seam slightly. Mark final muslin for plaid before cutting to
    observe this fact closely.</p>
  <p>The position of the hip dart was established by measuring a standard size
    14 model form. When making personal slopers, this would vary according to
    the relative hip and waist measurements of the individual. The best plan
    is to plan the dart for a figure having ideal proportions, such as those
    used in a model form, and then correct the position of the dart slightly
    while the muslin is upon the customer, if necessary.</p>
  <h3><em><a name="complete" id="complete"></a>Making Front and Back Hip-Length
    Slopers</em></h3>
  <p>Most designers, making full length garments or jackets, like to have slopers
    on hand of the two patterns made in the foregoing problems. In later problems,
    when you will use them for making various jacket designs and full length
    garments, you too will find it convenient.</p>
  <p>Cut away all seam allowances on the foregoing patterns and cut out the complete
    dart section, extending to the bust. Using brown cardboard, trace around
    the patterns and label them as shown in the diagrams below.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illust/03-82-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',334,285);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/03-82-a-t.jpg" alt="Drafting a back hip-length sloper" width="181" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>The notches are placed in the waistline area to mark the exact position
    of the waistline as that aids in placing other horizontal lines which might
    be a part of a design.</p>
  <p>Notice that the darts are squared off again in the finished sloper to hold
    the sections together. Make a hole, with your scissors, on the bust point
    as a means to pivoting the front section.</p>
  <p>Check the sloper to make sure that M-G and E-L are still in the original
    parallel position of the original draft.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><em><a name="make" id="make"></a><a href="illust/03-82-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',358,358);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/03-82-b-t.jpg" alt="Semi-fitted jacket" width="175" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>Semi-Fitted Jacket</em></h3>
  <p>This style of jacket is extremely popular because the front may be fitted
    as closely as desired and it is generally becoming to many women. It is
    made from the hip-length sloper. By closing the open-end dart at the hip-line,
    through pivoting, still more control is shifted to the shoulder area. This
    produces a jacket which has the grain of the fabric on the line of the bust
    <em>and hip lines.</em></p>
  <p>1. Starting with shoulder seam point A, trace A-B-C-D-K-L-E-F.</p>
  <p>2. Hold pencil in point of dart, pivot pattern to right until point M meets
    L. Continue tracing
    F-G-M-N-H-I-J-AA.</p>
  <p>3. Connect points A and AA with bust point F.</p>
  <p>4. Shorten darts as desired. Mark notches as for basic sloper to show waistline.</p>
  <p>5. Allow usual seams on the pattern, mark muslin for a plaid. It can be
    attached to the following back section for testing.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illust/03-83-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',366,377);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/03-83-a-t.jpg" alt="Figures 1 and 2" width="181" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>In this design for the jacket back, the vertical shaped seam A-B-F is abandoned
    for the straight line A-F which will lay upon the fold of the fabric when
    garment is cut. Because this straight line is shorter than the original shaped
    fitting line, this will cause the garment to only partially fit the back
    waistline.</p>
  <p>To modify this, the side darts may be increased at point C one-fourth inch,
    but if an attempt is made to establish a <em>close fit</em> through the use of darts
    only, horizontal wrinkles will appear at the center back of the garment.</p>
  <p>The semi-fitted silhouette is flattering to those who have abnormal proportions.
    It modifies the bad curves. The exact depth of the fitting must be decided
    by fitting directly upon the individual. The pattern can be cut and the muslin
    adjusted to suit and then the pattern proportions established from the muslin.
    The only women who should wear closely fitted clothes are those who have
    ideal figure proportions!</p>
  <p>NOTE: These various designs for vertically fitted jackets may be used interchangeably.
    The same patterns can be used for dresses which may be designed to have a
    sash or belt. Wash dresses, maids uniforms and other such types of apparel
    frequently are found to have the back section cut from this pattern.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><em><a name="introduce" id="introduce"></a><a href="illust/03-83-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',370,728);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/03-83-b-t.jpg" alt="Figures 1 and 2" width="354" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>Multiple Dart Tucks</em></h3>
  <p>Many variations of designs for either the back or front of jackets may be
    developed. The single dart may be substituted for several, just as you have
    learned in bodices. The foregoing diagrams show the bodice sloper pattern
    used as a foundation for such a style of garment.</p>
  <h3><em><a name="origin" id="origin"></a>French Lining Jacket</em></h3>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illust/03-84.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',359,670);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/03-84-t.jpg" alt="Figure 1" width="383" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>This design takes its name from the old shaped linings made as foundations
    for the draped garments of the 19th century when France provided most of
    the patterns for all our garments. It is also used over standard dress forms
    which custom designers pad up for special customers. The many seams provide
    opportunity for close adjustments as needed. In this simple form, it is a
    favorite with the coat and suit industry every year and is used as the basis
    for many classic styles each year.</p>
  <p>It is occasionally referred to as the &quot;princess&quot; style in dresses.
    Additional seams and secondary darts are occasionally used when desired.
    When used for dresses, it may be shortened and is then called the &quot;basque&quot; type.
    (<a href="mpd-08.html#178">See page 178</a>.)</p>
  <p>Obviously, when this principle of pattern designing is used in coats or
    jackets, shoulders may be broadened or raised to permit the use of padding
    (<a href="mpd-05.html#padding">see page 125</a>), but the sloper developed for use in jackets and coats could
    be used in the manner illustrated above and the garment would employ this
    same means of shaping the fabric to the figure. In these pages, the fundamental
    principles of cutting patterns are illustrated in various types of garments
    merely to show the reader how they might be used to produce a variety of
    garments.</p>
  <p><a name="pattern" id="pattern"></a>Note the dotted lines around the bust. The curved dotted line G-F produces
    a more <em>revealing</em> fit at that point. The &quot;rib measurement&quot; is used
    to decide the intensity of this curve. If the curved line G-F is intense,
    and therefore lengthened, it may be necessary to slash the front panel section
    horizontally between E and F and spread until the length of E-F equals the
    curved line G-F. This will produce a bust revealing garment which closely
    fits the diaphragm. To further emphasize the fit at this point, the center
    front edge may be curved also. Designers of expensive, simple but expertly
    fitted garments use these tricks in shaping which give unusual beauty to
    garments. At this stage, you are primarily studying <em>methods</em>. With study,
    you will master the finer points of this art of designing patterns.</p>
  <p>If the reader will turn to <a href="mpd-10.html#slip">pages 221</a> and <a href="mpd-11.html#vertical">230</a> he will find this same principle
    illustrated for cutting slips and coats. It is one of the most important
    principles of cutting, as all control has been absorbed in the seams and
    it produces a garment which is fitted entirely through the use of vertical
    seams. This permits the grain of the fabric to rest upon the bust and hip
    levels, which is assurance that the garment will hold its shape well with
    continuous wearing.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illust/03-85.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',366,646);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/03-85-t.jpg" alt="Figure 2" width="362" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Notice that the normal shoulder dart in the back section can be shifted
    into the seam. Also observe that the grain of the fabric is established across
    the bust. In normal figures this places the grain on the lower edge of the
    jacket also. As the lower edge of the jacket is of secondary importance except
    as a line of design, it may be altered to suit the posture of the wearer.</p>
  <p>Because this design is so very simple, it is of utmost importance that the
    position of the seams be pleasingly established.</p>
  <p>For further study clip many examples of the use of this basic cut in all
    types of apparel, from bathing suits to bridal attire. You will soon be aware
    of its possibilities in designing. It is least interesting in this simple
    form.</p>
  <p>You will observe, upon assembling several variations of this French lining
    pattern, that through slight changes in line, or through the addition of
    varying shaped pockets, it may be adapted to figures of varying proportions.
    When fashion calls for movement at the back of the jackets, flares may be
    added in the same manner they would be added to gores in skirts. Inverted
    pleats may be inserted in the lower seams as they would be in skirts, also.
    Through interesting styling details added to the seams, a new design may
    emerge&#8212;and yet the same <em>pattern</em> remains. Hence, it is important, to
    the hobbyist who may design patterns as a means of developing a personal
    wardrobe, to produce a well fitted French lining pattern which may be used
    again and again in clothing. It saves much time and gives further opportunity
    for producing new designs, each of which is dependent upon the fabric and
    the details for new design interest.</p>
  <p>Upon thumbing through period fashion books, you will find that this same
    French lining was used for the jackets of our grandmothers' day. You will
    find that this method of shaping men's garments was used in early days also.
    Many old records offer excellent inspiration for modern designs.</p>
  <h3><em>Variations of French Lining</em></h3>
  <p>On the following page we have an interesting variation of the basic French
    Lining. Through the combination of line, we create the illusion of width
    through the shoulders and then narrow the waist with the vertical lines in
    that area.</p>
  <p>Because the new curved line falls directly over the bust, blending into
    the vertical line of the original dart, the control becomes shifted to that
    position. The curve of the bust has been intensified just for further beauty
    of the silhouette, as in the previous problem.</p>
  <p><em><a href="illust/03-86-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',347,732);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/03-86-a-t.jpg" alt="Variations of French lining" width="435" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>However, in the back section, the curved line does <em>not</em> fall across the point
    of the shoulder control dart and therefore we still have need for a control
    dart near the neck or shoulder. It has been placed at the shoulder neck point
    rather than the shoulder in order not to distract the attention from the
    main style interest in the garment.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illust/03-86-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',348,737);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/03-86-b-t.jpg" alt="Variations of French lining" width="383" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Below, the dotted lines of stitching show the position of the first division
    of the pattern. When these have been established and the pattern is cut apart,
    the simulated pleats are <em>built on</em> when making the final pattern. Because
    these seams are curved at the waistline, these simulated pleats must be faced.
    These facing patterns are made from the final pattern. Notches should be
    placed in the shoulder seam to show where the topstitching should start.
    This design presents a construction problem which must be understood by the
    pattern designer to insure success in the final garment.</p>
  <h3><em><a name="peplum" id="peplum"></a>Peplum Jackets</em></h3>
  <p><em><a href="illust/03-87.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',686,738);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/03-87-t.jpg" alt="Peplum jackets" width="500" height="464" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em></p>
  <p class="clear">The peplum style of jacket, which provides for a seam at the waistline is
    used for women having small waist measurement and large hip line. The back
    is used in combination with French lining styles when practical to do so.</p>
  <p><a name="panel" id="panel"></a>As shown in small diagrams, occasionally the center front panel section
    is made without the waistline seam and then the small side peplum section
    is added. The panel effect is slenderizing and the seam from the panel to
    side seam at the waist aids in attaining a perfect fit in that area. Observe
    that this would be possible in the back also, but in such case the dart would
    not be eliminated as it would form the effect of the part from the dart point
    down through the hips.</p>
  <p>These various styles of jacket patterns may serve as the basis for full
    length coats and dresses in unlimited variations. Through slashing, additional
    fullness may be added as desired. These will be illustrated in later examples
    showing the possibilities for cutting patterns for coats and other full length
    garments.</p>

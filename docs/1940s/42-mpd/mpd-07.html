<h3><em><a name="importance" id="importance"></a>Collars and Cuffs</em></h3>
<p>A well fitting collar may make or break a garment. The thought and study which
  may be necessary to originating a beautiful collar is well worth the time and
  effort because the same pattern may be used repeatedly in its same form or
  with minor changes. Wholesale manufacturing designers always have their &quot;pet&quot; collar
  patterns which they find to please many types of women. In fact, the right
  proportions to a collar may be what sells the dress by the hundreds.</p>
<p>A well fitting collar must be comfortable and flattering. It must be so designed
  as to permit wearing a wrap, if it is on a dress. If it is attached to a coat,
  it must permit wearing a hat unless it is attached to an evening wrap.</p>
<p>The same basic principles used to produce collar patterns may be applied to
  designing cuff patterns. As cuffs are usually of secondary interest and may
  merely repeat the design interest of the collar, only limited space will be
  devoted to the study of cuffs in this text.</p>
<p>Collars are graded when garments are reduced or increased in size. The collar
  which has been designed for a size 16 would appear of wrong proportion when
  used on a size 40 dress. Certain collars, having certain degree of roll or
  stand, are better suited to junior size dresses. Others prove more adaptable
  for children's apparel and still others give a feeling of dignity and would
  be used for clothes for elderly women.</p>
<p class="clear"><em><strong><a href="illust/07-145.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',197,190);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/07-145-t.jpg" alt="Vocabulary of the collar" width="168" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em><a name="vocab" id="vocab"></a><em>Vocabulary</em>: Before attempting to interpret the instructions for making collars,
  it is important that you know the terms which are used to describe certain
  portions of collars. They are:</p>
<p><em>Attached</em>: A collar so designed as to be attached to any shaped neckline and
  to be so worn without being adjustable.</p>
<p><em>Convertible</em>: A collar designed to be attached to bodice in such manner as
  to permit wearing it open or closed and still maintain a finished appearance.</p>
<p class="clear"><em><strong><a href="illust/07-146-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',134,291);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/07-146-a-t.jpg" alt="Break line" width="271" height="114" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>Break</em>: A term used to indicate the point where the rever, which is built in
  with the bodice, may start to fold back into lapel.</p>
<p><em>Neckline</em>: The portion of the collar which will be attached to the garment.</p>
<p><em>Style Line</em>: The outer edge of the collar where trimming may be added.</p>
<p><em>Stand</em>: The portion of the collar which provides the height of roll.</p>
<p><em>Folding Line</em>: The actual point along which the roll appears when
  collar is being worn. It may be imaginary or pressed into a flat edge as in
  tailored
  suit types.</p>
<p><em>Classification of Collars</em>: From a pattern designer's point of view, collars
  may be classified into three major classifications, namely: Attached Collars,
  Convertible Collars and Tailored Suit Collars. These classifications refer
  to principle of cut rather than functional use of collar itself. Some collars
  are cut by one method, others by a combination of two methods.</p>
<p>NOTE: All measurements given are for full size garments&#8212;14 to 18.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a name="attached" id="attached"></a>ATTACHED COLLARS</h3>
<p><a name="sloper" id="sloper"></a><em><strong><a href="illust/07-146-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',470,241);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/07-146-b-t.jpg" alt="Collar sloper" width="98" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>Making the Collar Sloper: </em>Neckwear designers use a collar sloper to produce
  new designs for collars to be attached to varied size garments. Custom designers
  usually use the new neckline on the garment pattern instead of a sloper as
  the single collar design will be used as a part of the design for a garment.
  Likewise with the wholesale dress or coat designers. The sloper merely represents
  the shape of the area around the neckline, with notches placing the position
  of the shoulder seam of the bodice sloper.</p>
<p><strong>1. Place front and back bodice slopers together in manner indicated on this
  page.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Trace around them on manila cardboard.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Measure inward from points E, A and F a distance equal to one half the
  shoulder seam length. Describe circle parallel to neckline which will connect
  these points.</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. Mark notches showing position of basic shoulder seam. Label front and back.
  Cut out the sloper, ready for use when needed.</strong></p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><a name="flat" id="flat"></a>Flat Collar</em></h3>
<p>This<em><strong><a href="illust/07-147-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',213,262);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/07-147-a-t.jpg" alt="Flat collar" width="219" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em> name<em><strong><a href="illust/07-146-c.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',210,274);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/07-146-c-t.jpg" alt="Flat collar" width="234" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em> is given to any collar which appears to lie flat around the base
  of the neck with no visible appearance of any roll. It may be cut directly
  from the collar sloper or the shaped neckline of any garment for which the
  pattern has been designed and collar is to become a part of.</p>
<p>Trace around sloper and add 1/8 inch around neckline which will reduce its
  true size slightly. Mark indicators. Add 1/4 inch seams to style line and make
  facing
  pattern. Cut bias neck band.</p>
<p>NOTE: When attaching neck band, or sewing collar directly to garment, neckline
  of collar must be stretched very slightly to fit. This will cause a very slight
  roll, which provides space for edge of garment to lie between collar band and
  collar. This little trick prevents tendency of the flat collar to &quot;kick
  up&quot; on the edge upon being attached to neckline of garment.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><a name="plastron" id="plastron"></a><strong><a href="illust/07-147-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',262,300);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/07-147-b-t.jpg" alt="Plastron type collar" width="202" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>Plastron Type Collar</em></h3>
<p>The plastron collar above is merely a flat collar which has been finished
  without the neck band to attach it to garment. The neckline is built up 1/8
  inch, plus the normal 1/8 inch seam allowance to insure a close fit so neckline
  of
  garment will not creep up above neckline of collar. Some designers attach tabs
  at the center front and each side of back closing so the collar may be temporarily
  attached with small safety pins. The illustration shows a plastron collar with
  a round neck designed to conceal a square neck on garment. Notice how the buttonholes
  on the collar have been placed in line with buttons on the dress to facilitate
  buttoning the collar down firmly in front.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><a name="bertha" id="bertha"></a>Bertha Collar</em></h3>
<p>The <em><strong><a href="illust/07-147-d.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',225,269);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/07-147-d-t.jpg" alt="Bertha collar" width="213" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em>true<em><strong><a href="illust/07-147-c.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',184,288);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/07-147-c-t.jpg" alt="Bertha collar" width="268" height="164" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em> Bertha collar extends from the neckline to a point just beyond the
  normal armscye. Occasionally you see a similar type collar which has a definite
  shaping seam over the arm. Such a collar would be made from the Dolman cape
  pattern.</p>
<p>The neckline is reduced in size to form the tiny roll and collar is completed
  in manner desired. Should it be used on a garment having a puffed sleeve, it
  would be slashed and spread slightly at normal shoulder seam position to
  insure the neckline fit.</p>
<p> This collar derives its name from a short cape which was popular in
  the 1920's. It need not necessarily be used with a close, round neckline
  nor have a round style line. It may be emphasized in outline  by the addition
  of ruffles or it might be cut into several sections to add further interest.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><a name="rippled" id="rippled"></a>Rippled Collar</em></h3>
<p>The rippled collar,<em><strong><a href="illust/07-148-c.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',384,258);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/07-148-c-t.jpg" alt="Rippled collar" width="131" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em> cut <em><strong><a href="illust/07-148-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',240,326);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/07-148-a-t.jpg" alt="Rippled collar" width="243" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em>on a circular flare principle is youthful and pleasing.
  In this design, the collar has the seams at normal shoulder position and center
  front in order to have each half the front spread into a complete circle. Necessity
  for seams would be dependent upon the degree of fullness. If collar closes
  at center front, no center back seam is needed. Circular ruffles may be introduced
  to plain round collars, or small godets set into the style line at intervals.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><a name="elizabethan" id="elizabethan"></a>Elizabethan Collars</em></h3>
<p>It<em><strong><a href="illust/07-148-d.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',346,328);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/07-148-d-t.jpg" alt="Elizabethan collar" width="165" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em> has <em><strong><a href="illust/07-148-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',175,218);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/07-148-b-t.jpg" alt="Elizabethan collar" width="198" height="155" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em>been told that proud Queen Elizabeth sponsored this fashion for collars
  which would conceal the back of the neck because she had a blemish and wished
  to conceal it. It became conventional attire during her reign along with the
  wide stiff ruff. It being impractical to wear under wraps, it is generally
  used for hostess and bridal gowns. In more conservative proportions, it is
  seen on waitress and beauty operator uniforms. This demonstrates method for
  using a style neckline as basis for designing collar. The slashes are started
  1 1/2 inches from center back. <em>This is the secret of making the collar
  stand up without artificial support.</em> Spread sections 1/4 inch each for
  a collar 4 inches wide.</p>
<p>When a strip of old lace is being used, one is  reluctant to cut it. A similar
  style of collar can be produced by shaping it with darts which reduce the style
  line down to size of neckline. In this design, sections A and B would be folded
  back under neckline of the garment. If the ends of the lace were mitred into
  squares, a similar style to that illustrated at the left would result.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><a name="half" id="half"></a>Half <strong><a href="illust/07-149-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',128,192);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/07-149-a-t.jpg" alt="Half rollcollar" width="172" height="108" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>Roll Collar</em></h3>
<p>This style of collar is extremely popular in the dress industry because it
  is becoming to many women. It has a stand at the back which gradually lessens
  until the collar lies flat at the front base of the throat. It is adaptable
  to various shapes of necklines as the following illustrations show. The basic
  instructions apply to any one of the three varieties of the following finished
  collars illustrated.</p>
<p class="clear"><strong><a name="simple" id="simple"></a>1. Draw<em><a href="illust/07-149-c.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',135,226);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/07-149-c-t.jpg" alt="Half rollcollar" width="206" height="115" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em> around <em><a href="illust/07-149-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',249,323);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/07-149-b-t.jpg" alt="Half rollcollar" width="232" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>front and back bodice slopers
  as illustrated, shifting the shoulder dart over to the shoulder for convenience.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Draw in the style line of the front of the collar on the front tracing.
  Label A, B and C.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Label points G and E on back bodice tracing.</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. From center back point G, measure upward a distance equal to twice the
  desired amount of stand in the finished collar. Mark point H and locate J halfway
  between G and H. J is the folding line position.</strong></p>
<p><strong>5. From point J, measure downward a distance equal to the desired
    finished width of the collar at the back plus 1/4 inch. (F)</strong></p>
<p><strong>6. Locate point D by measuring line A-C on front bodice.</strong></p>
<p><strong>7. Square a line from H equal to back garment neckline G-E.</strong></p>
<p><strong>8. Connect D and I.</strong></p>
<p><strong>9. Cut out back portion of collar: D-I-H-J-G-F-D. Also cut out front collar
  section. Arrange the two sections so shoulder seams meet. Blend in line I-B.
  Complete final pattern and muslin.</strong></p>
<p>NOTE: Should you wish to reduce the width of the collar at the shoulder, to
  merely trim off the edge would cause it to sag at the shoulder.<em> A new draft
  must be made to the desired new proportions.</em></p>
<p>So that you may readily appreciate the many possibilities for creating
  new designs from a single collar pattern which fits attractively around the
  neckline, it is wise to pause here for experiment.</p>
<p>Because the line D-I supports the collar at a given point at the shoulder
  seam, the changes must be made from that point to the center front. Place a
  piece
  of thin paper over the illustration of this collar (upper left column). Trace
  in the area from the neck and shoulders to the collar edge, then roughly sketch
  out a few ideas for cutting experimental patterns. When you have a few, trace
  around the final pattern for this collar, first trimming away all seam allowances.
  Test the results of your pencil ideas, which may require correction when the
  muslin proof is on the model form. Round lines may be changed to diagonal,
  diagonal to vertical and horizontal, and so on.</p>
<p>Run through your daily newspaper ads, clipping interesting collar illustrations.
  After collecting a few, and working out some more basic collar patterns presented
  here, you will see that just a few patterns form the basis for hundreds of
  new designs that vary <em>only </em>in the style line at the front.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><a name="sailor" id="sailor"></a><strong><a href="illust/07-150.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',395,732);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/07-150-t.jpg" alt="Half roll sailor collar" width="332" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>Half Roll Sailor Collar</em></h3>
<p>Although many sailor collars are cut to lie flat, if a little stand is provided
  in the back, it will provide room for the bulk of the scarf and it will also
  be a little more becoming, especially to adult figures. The method used for
  this collar is identical with that used in the previous problem except that
  the V neckline is established first and then the remainder of the pattern is
  drafted.</p>
<p>When you have become familiar with the results of varying degrees of stand
  provided in collars, you will observe that the wider the collar, the less stand
  it should have. A satisfactory pattern was produced from this sketch in which
  the stand did not exceed three-fourths of an inch. If the stand is too high,
  from a profile view, the wearer will appear round-shouldered.</p>
<p>Because the original design for this half-roll collar was planned to provide
  width through the shoulders, the line D-I (which is dependent upon the original
  line A-C) is longer than it was in the previous pattern involving this cutting
  principle.</p>
<p>Although this illustration shows the conventional type of sailor collar, designers
  vary them in many ways, sometimes designing the front to be square and to fall
  slightly lower or higher than the point at which the lower back edge rests
  upon the shoulders.</p>
<p>If a deep V-neck similar to this were to be used as a detail of a hostess
  gown, the designer might employ gently curved lines and continue them into
  a curve across the back. Provided the length of the line D-I in the basic pattern
  isn't changed, she would use the same basic pattern to produce new designs
  quickly and accurately.</p>
<p>When you have experimented with variations of this basic collar, draft a new
  one from this same principle which will be attached to an oval neckline. Establish
  the line A-B first and then proceed in the usual manner. Compare the shapes
  of the two collars.</p>
<p>NOTE: Collars that have a stand at the back cannot be successfully closed
  in the back. To attempt this would result in the loss of the stand, and the
  entire beauty of the collar would be destroyed.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><a name="shawl" id="shawl"></a><strong><a href="illust/07-151.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',291,706);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/07-151-t.jpg" alt="Half roll shawl collar" width="443" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>Half Roll Shawl Collar</em></h3>
<p>Like the sailor collar, the shawl (sometimes called &quot;fichu&quot;) collar
  may be cut flat or in a varying degree of roll as desired. In a simple style,
  it is used for mature women's clothing because it gives the feeling of dignity
  to the wearer and when it has been styled interestingly or given a new line
  through changing the style line, it may assume a more youthful feeling. A similar
  effect is achieved by the use of a simple bias fold of fabric such as that
  purchased at any trimming counter. However, that type will stand rather high
  at the back of the neck and this pattern may be designed as desired. You will
  also study another means of cutting a similar appearing collar in a later problem.</p>
<p>Notice that the little quarter circle godet which is set into the small slit
  at the point creates a softened effect and invites the eye above the bust level.
  Any number of interesting designs can be produced from the basic shawl collar
  pattern as long as the width of line D-I which rests upon the shoulder is not
  changed. Such a change, you have previously learned, will mean drafting an
  entirely new pattern to the revised width at that point. Notice the compound
  sweeping curve which appears through point OD on the finished pattern. This
  gives a graceful line to the silhouette of the collar, even when used in a
  simple form.</p>
<p> When the pattern is finished, try laying it on the muslin with a true bias
    fold at the center back and observe the result. The bias will permit the
  collar to adjust more smoothly. A collar which has an inch stand in the pattern
  will
    appear to have but a three-fourth inch stand when worn if cut on a true bias.
    While making this pattern, watch your proportions when planning the godet.</p>
<p>Because line A-B is straight, such a collar, when drafted, might be made a
  part of the bodice front from A to B. Lay the collar against the bodice front
  tracing, so the neckline edge B-I rests along the line A-B, and see how such
  a seam might be eliminated by placing a seam at the center back of the collar
  (the garment would slip over the head). If this type collar is planned for
  a surplice bodice front, the surplice pattern is made as usual (<a href="mpd-01.html#surplice">page
  44</a>); then
  the collar pattern is sketched between the V-neckline and armscye and traced
  off on a separate sheet of paper. From there on, the procedure for completing
  the collar would be as shown above.</p>
<p>The author wishes to emphasize, now that you have observed and compared collars
  with no stand and those with a stand at the back only, that the latter is the
  more popular&#8212;and more becoming to most women and girls. The truly flat
  collar is quite juvenile. As women mature, a prominent bone appears at the
  back of the neck. The collar with a slight stand conceals this; it also tends
  to give, from the front, a well-proportioned neck. The half-roll collar also
  hides prominent collar-bones.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><a name="full" id="full"></a><strong><a href="illust/07-152-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',121,186);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/07-152-a-t.jpg" alt="Full roll collar" width="166" height="101" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>Full Roll Collar</em></h3>
<p>Although this collar is sometimes called the &quot;Peter-Pan,&quot; it takes
  its professional name from the appearance when being worn. The finished collar
  should have a stand which is equal around the base of the neck. Because of
  the roll, it is especially pleasing for the woman who has an exceptionally
  thin, long neck as its round shape softens her angular features. It is youthful,
  so is not suited to elderly or mature women and should be definitely avoided
  by the woman having a round face and short, broad neck. When cut on the bias,
  the roll is less apparent and it appears cut that way in the majority of designs.
  If you wish to make the experiment, you will see that this collar, when cut
  wide, will be unpleasant in appearance as width seems to emphasize the rolled
  appearance. Therefore it is made rather narrow.</p>
<p class="clear"><strong><em><a href="illust/07-152-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',437,222);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/07-152-b-t.jpg" alt="Figure 1" width="97" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>1. Trace around the shoulder area of front bodice sloper. Extend the line
  A-B outward from the shoulder neck point as a guide line.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Place the back bodice sloper against this guide line as shown in diagram
  with points C and B meeting. Fig. 1.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Square a guide line from the center front point E. Draw in the desired
  style line of the collar from the center back to the shoulder seam. Make this
  follow the general contour of the neckline.</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. Following the same shallow curved line of D-C, continue on to make the
  front collar line C-E.</strong></p>
<p><strong>5. Because the new collar line C-E is more shallow than the bodice front neckline
  B-E, it must be extended on to point F or until it equals the original neckline
  measurement, B-E, to which it will ultimately be attached.</strong></p>
<p><strong>6. From point F, complete the front style line to meet that which has already
  been sketched into the back section.</strong></p>
<p>NOTE: In this design, a rounded front has been used, but it could be square
  or the curved lines inverted if desired. <em>The distance that the front of your
  collar design stands away from the guide line will be the distance the same
  point will be from the center front edge of your finished blouse when the collar
  has been attached.</em></p>
<p><strong>7. Trace out the outline of the collar in blue pencil. Observe that it is
  a very shallow curved shape. It is this shallow curve, sewed to the deep curve
  of the garment neckline which produces the roll around the neck.</strong></p>
<p> It is suggested that you try this same type of collar in varying widths and
    with a variety of front shapes. You will then be able to observe its limitations.</p>
<p>Compare this finished full roll collar pattern with those made for the half-roll
  and the flat roll collars. Lay the center backs of all three collars one upon
  the other. Notice that the straighter the neckline, the more rolled the collar
  will become. This is an important fact to remember when you are designing collars.</p>

<p>If you will compare the shapes of all the collars you have produced thus far,
  you will see that the less curve there is in the collar, the more stand it
  will have when worn. The man's collar, being made of a straight strip of shaped

  shirts and other mannish apparel for women. Men's shirts show a wide variety
  of proportions and styles to suit the varying facial proportions of men.</p>

<p>A-B and C-D equal one half neck measurement. F-D equals half back neck measurement.
  B-D and A-C are equal in length. Locate point E half way between A and C one

  curves.</p>

<p>Convertible collars are so named because they are designed to be worn either
  closed or open. When in the closed position, the convertible collar appears
  somewhat like a half roll collar attached to the neckline. When worn open,
  the front of the bodice folds back to assume the appearance of revers and the
  collar has a notched design. Such styles of collars must be accompanied with
  a facing which is attached to the bodice front so the garment will have a finished
  appearance either way it is worn.</p>
<p>Naturally, the width of the rever portion is governed by the amount of lap
  which is provided for closing the garment. They are, therefore, quite similar
  on all types of styles. The basic neckline is usually lowered slightly to create
  varied results, and the style line of the front of the collar may be varied
  as desired. However, as this type of collar is an accompaniment to so many
  tailored shirt-waist types of blouses and dresses, the proportions have become
  somewhat standardized and a designer will use what he considers to be the best
  proportions in many of his garments year after year.</p>
<p>After painstaking analysis in our classrooms, it was found that two types
  of the convertible sports type collar could be successfully developed on the
  same cutting principle. Although similar in appearance from a front view, these
  two collars are quite different in fit in the back.</p>
<p>For the sake of comparison, they are illustrated with similar pointed ends.
  However, there is no reason why they couldn't have curved ends instead. The
  important feature is the variance of cut in the back of each. It achieves a
  different fit.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><a name="sports" id="sports"></a><strong><a href="illust/07-154-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',339,355);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/07-154-a-t.jpg" alt="Active sports collar" width="184" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>Active Sports Collar</em></h3>
<p>This collar provides a close fit at the back of the neck when both open and
  closed. This snug fit at that point makes it more becoming and also more practical
  for wear under suit jackets and coats.</p>
<p>The first step is to lower the front bodice neck line slightly, removing some
  of the intense curve.</p>
<p><strong>1. To draft the collar, draw the horizontal line A-B equal to one half the
  new garment neckline.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. To locate point C, square a line downward from B equal to one-half
    desired stand at back. This may vary from 1 to1 1/2 inches as desired.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Locate D by squaring a line upward from B which is also equal to half the
  desired stand.</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. Locate E from point D, a distance equal to D-C plus 1/4 inch. (As
    this is the style line of the collar, it must be made deep enough to hide
    seam at neckline.)</strong></p>
<p><strong>5. B-H and E-G equal one half the back neckline measurement. They are squared
  from points B and E respectively.</strong></p>
<p><strong>6. C-A is squared from C up to a point in line with point H and then breaks
  to form a compound curve. Complete desired shape of points on collar at F.</strong></p>
<p>NOTE: The guide line A-B equaled the original neckline measurement. Curved
  line C-A has now become the edge of the collar and will be longer than the
  straight line A-B. Make A-C equal to A-B by moving E-C inward accordingly.
  Cut final pattern and make muslin proof with A-F-G-E-D-B-C-H-A comprising the
  one half of the collar cut on fold at center back.</p>
<h3><em>Variation of Active Sports Collar</em></h3>
<p>This variation of the regulation convertible sports collar looks about the
  same as the previous collar except at the back, where, instead of closely fitting
  about the back of the neck, it has a tendency to stand away from the neck.
  It is a good feature in the cotton sports garments because it provides ventilation
  at that point, but, when this collar is worn beneath the tailored jacket,
  which is made to fit up closely at the back of the neck, then the collar wrinkles
  badly and appears ill fitted.</p>
<p>Note that the style line of this collar appears on a straight line while the
  previous design provided for a slight fitting curve. This shaping curve contributes
  to the good fit, but unless the garment is intended to be worn closed, it can
  be designed on a straight line if desired. This collar develops nicely when
  using the striped fabrics because the style line is straight.</p>

<p><strong>2. B-E is three times the desired amount of stand.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. A-C is a shallow sloping line which becomes the neckline of the finished
  collar.</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. Broken line A-D represents the folding line in the fabric.</strong></p>
<p><strong>5. E-F is squared from B-E. It is a straight line. Connect points F and A.</strong></p>
<p><strong>6. Your finished collar pattern is represented by the area A-F-E-D-C-A. Line
  C-A is longer than the guide line B-A which was made equal to half the bodice

<p>Try your pattern with a collar four inches wide with a stand of one inch on
  a full size garment. When back section has been drafted, cut it out and complete
  design as for the full roll collar. The squared line from center front is a
  guide line for making design for end of the collar. It may then be shaped as
  desired for the finished garment.</p>
<p>Note the compound curve at the shoulder point of collar. This permits it to
  adjust to curve of body. Center front of garment can be lowered as in active
  sports collar.</p>

<p>The mannish-type tailored suit collar is so named because it is generally
  used for men's apparel. It resembles the convertible collar but it is not convertible
  and is not cut to be worn closed. When you have studied the method used to
  produce this type of collar, you will see that many styles may be designed
  upon that same basic method. The problems which follow this first explanation
  involve the repeated use of this basic procedure with varying proportions.
  <a name="points" id="points"></a>The four basic points where variety is shown may be listed as follows:</p>
<p><strong>1. The height of the closing which establishes break of rever.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. The width and shape of the rever portions.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. The height of the notch.</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. The shape of the collar portion.</strong></p>
<p>When we stop to consider that the majority of men's coat styles are dependent
  upon these varied points of collar design, we can appreciate that some designs
  for tailored suit collars will be becoming to certain women while others will
  be suited to some other women. A mature dignified appearing garment can be
  produced or a snappy, impudent appearance can be produced.</p>
<p><a name="method" id="method"></a>Many methods have been worked out for producing this collar in men's tailoring
  work. Exhaustive tests were made by students in class sessions and as a result,
  the method given here was produced. The method was then tested with many varying
  heights of the closing, heights of stand, widths of revers and heights of the
  notch. It then became apparent that this method might be accepted as being
  adaptable for designing women's garments. Very few women's garments are &quot;man-tailored&quot; and
  it was necessary to work out a method which would produce a neat, smartly fitted
  tailored suit collar which could be made of soft fabrics. The finished garment
  depends upon final construction.</p>
<p>Although the following examples afford an opportunity for you to create many
  designs from this basic method, to complete this study, you should clip many
  examples of the tailored suit collars. You will find that fashion in certain
  years will favor the high closing, for instance, with rounded lapels.</p>
<p>Another year the notches may be open and the next year they may be closed.
  In a like manner, fashions for men change from year to year, yet these changes
  are all based upon the use of the same collar.</p>
<h3><em>The Single Breasted Type with Medium Closing</em></h3>
<p>The proportions given for making the draft for this collar are based upon
  a normal size 14 figure.</p>
<p>In each of the following problems, a suggested height of the stand has been
  given. These dimensions produced what the writer considered the most pleasing
  muslin for the height of the closing. In manufacturing plants, such dimensions
  are more or less standardized at between 1 inch to 1 1/2 inches. When using
  these instructions to produce a pattern for individuals, the length of the
  neck should
  be considered and stand of the collar changed accordingly.</p>
<p>The accompanying sketch shows an average garment having the tailored suit
  collar. The height of closing, width of revers, position of notch and the height
  of stand are average. Therefore it would be a style suited to mass production.</p>
<p class="clear"><strong><em><a href="illust/07-157-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',307,362);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/07-157-a-t.jpg" alt="Figures 1 and 2" width="209" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em></strong>Experiment in our resident classrooms proved that, to produce a well fitting
  collar of this type, best results were obtained in most of the styles,<em> if
  a portion of the basic bodice control was thrown to the center front. </em>This results
  in length being added from the shoulder neck point B and the center front point
  A. (Figs. 1 &amp; 2.)</p>
<p>It is necessary that you know just how much additional length will result
  from pivoting some of the control to the center front as the darts vary in
  size in different personal blocks. Figs. 1 and 2 show how this may be done.</p>
<p><strong><a name="157" id="157"></a>1. Square a horizontal line from the center front of your waistline sloper
  over to the point of the bust. Label this point C.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Starting from point C, trace around the sloper to the point of
    the dart, as shown by the arrows in Fig. 1. </strong><strong>Keeping the sloper firmly in position, label your starting point on your draft
  as point A.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Place your pencil in the dart point and pivot the sloper to the left as
  shown in Fig. 2, until point C on the sloper is the desired distance (the desired
  extra length being added for the type of collar being drafted) from point A
  on your draft. With your sloper held in position, complete the tracing up to
  shoulder neck point B.</strong></p>
<p>NOTE: It is only necessary to trace the sloper to point B and it does leave
  the area between points A and B unhampered with unnecessary lines.</p>
<p><em>Read Each Step Carefully</em></p>
<p>1. Trace around front bodice sloper, from A to B, pivoting one inch into the
  center front. (See above instructions.) This amount can vary.</p>
<p>2. Establish height of closing two inches below bust line. Add one and one-half
  inches lap. Label point C.</p>
<p>3. Extend shoulder line from B three-fourths inch to locate point D. (This
  amount standard in all sizes.)</p>
<p>4. Draw folding line C-D. Extend this line from D a distance equal to one-half
  back neck measurement plus 1/4 inch. Label point E. (This added fraction should
  be doubled when making double breasted styles.)</p>
<p>5. Square the line E-F from line D-E. It is one-half inch long. Connect F
  and D.</p>
<p>6. Line F-G is squared from line F-D. It is one and one-fourth inch long or
  <em>the desired stand</em>. Label G.</p>
<p>7. The line G-H is squared from G and is one-fourth inch long in all standard
  sizes. Label point H.</p>
<p>8. Connect points F and H. Extend line H-F through F, a distance equal to
  the collar stand (F-G) plus one-half inch. Label point I. This is the width
  of the collar at the center back.</p>
<p>9. Fold pattern paper under on <em>folding line</em> C-D. Sketch in desired shape of
  collar and lapel upon front bodice section using proportions shown in your
  sketch for a basis. Locate point J, temporarily, on the folding line.</p>
<p>10. Trace these lines through with your wheel and then open paper flat. With
  blue pencil, trace over the perforated lines so you may clearly see the shape
  of the pattern as it appears at this stage.</p>
<p>11. The shape of the line H-B will vary with different styles. In this case,
  it is a shallow curved line. Start to form this line by squaring a distance
  of one and one-half inches from H and then, with the aid of your curve, connect
  the line with point B. In some designs, a straight, squared line from H might
  connect with B. In other types of closings, it may appear as a reverse curve.
  However, in any case, always start the line by squaring a short distance from
  H so your pattern for center back collar won't have a point.</p>
<p>12. In order to give a pleasing appearance when the garment is being worn,
  the line J-K should have the appearance of being practically straight. It should
  extend smoothly through point J. Lay your curve from KK to B, using the straight
  arm. If point J does not fall exactly on the line, that is not important as
  the neckline of this type of collar is not fixed, as in the convertible type,
  but is actually part of the design. KK-J-B should be a continuous sweeping
  line.</p>
<p>13. The next step is to complete the style line of the collar. When you sketched
  in your design in step #9, you traced the design for the ends which would appear
  as a part of the notched design lying upon the chest when garment is worn.
  That portion is labeled J-KK-MM-OO. The remaining style line of the rest of
  the collar must be dependent upon the first sketched lines made in step #9.
  Square a line from center back line I-F a distance of one inch ?nd label that
  point Q. Connect points I-Q-OO-MM with a shallow compound curve.</p>
<p>14. The collar being cut double, the under section usually is cut on the bias
  with a shaped seam which aids in making the upper collar hug the back of the
  neck closely. The revers are cut in one with the bodice and have a facing which
  extends out to the dotted line N-P.</p>
<p class="clear"><strong><em><a href="illust/07-157-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',648,373);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/07-157-b-t.jpg" alt="Figure 3" width="112" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em></strong>NOTE:
  Although, to avoid confusion in the diagram, notches were not placed in Fig.
  3, they should be recorded before following tracings are
  made of the various sections. A cross sectional line across the line J-KK with
  the tracing wheel will establish position of the notch which may then be made
  in the usual manner in the final pattern.</p>
<p>15. On another piece of pattern paper, trace off the pattern for facing: B-Q-N-P-C-LL-KK-J-B.</p>
<p>16. As your upper, or outside collar portion wilt be attached to the facing,
  trace this section off next: MM-KK-J-B-H-F-I-Q-OCHMM. Establish grain parallel
  to center back of collar and indicate with three circles for a fold.</p>
<p>17. Trace off pattern for bodice front: C-LL-KK-J-B-O-N around armscye and
  bodice to C.</p>
<p>18. Trace off pattern for half of under collar: MM-KK-J-B-H-G-F-I-Q-OO-MM.
  Note the shaped center back which provides for use of a seam. Also note that
  the neckline of the collar facing is larger than the upper collar. This is
  necessary when the heavy woolen is used for lining and is not turned under
  but &quot;cat-stitched&quot; over the neck seam of garment as in men's suit
  coats. When making a silk weight jacket, the under collar is made identical
  to upper collar. In this problem, cut the upper and lower pattern sections
  to study their usefulness.</p>
<p>19. Provide normal seam allowances to all edges except the collar and rever
  edges and edge of facing. These may be smaller because there is little strain
  on them. Retain your draft and complete your muslin as instructed on the following
  page. To get a good test, baste sections together instead of pinning them.</p>
<h3><a name="assemble" id="assemble"></a>ASSEMBLING CONVERTIBLE AND TAILORED SUIT COLLARS</h3>
<p>The proper method for assembling the convertible style collar, or the tailored
  suit notched collar, is simple. However, because so few of our resident students
  were familiar with the method, it was believed advisable to include these instructions
  in this text.</p>
<p>It is not practical to attempt to assemble the Muslin by the pinning method,
  so a basting stitch should be used instead.</p>
<p class="clear"><strong><em><a href="illust/07-159-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',326,336);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/07-159-a-t.jpg" alt="Figures 1 through 6" width="181" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em></strong>1. If the under collar has been planned to have a seam at the center back,
  sew these two sections together. (Fig. 1.)</p>
<p>2. Sew shoulder seams of bodice. (Fig. 2.)</p>
<p>3. Sew shoulder seams of facing sections together. (Fig. 3.) (When no back
  facing is used, the collar would be attached to the front portions of the facings.)</p>
<p class="clear">4. Starting from <strong><em><a href="illust/07-159-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',293,306);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/07-159-b-t.jpg" alt="Figure 4" width="183" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em></strong>the<strong><em><a href="illust/07-159-c.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',147,361);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/07-159-c-t.jpg" alt="Figure 5" width="200" height="74" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em></strong> center back, pin the neck edge of the upper collar to
  the neck edge of the facing, working toward the front of the garment. Keep
  the material flat upon the table. Baste and remove pins. (Fig. 5.)</p>
<p>5. Sew neckline of the under collar to neckline of the bodice, working in
  the same manner.
  (Fig. 4.) In tailored wool suits, this step would be eliminated. (Examine a
  man's coat collar.)</p>
<p>6. Flatten and snip raw edges of seams on both sections just assembled.</p>
<p class="clear"><strong><em><a href="illust/07-159-d.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',298,408);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/07-159-d-t.jpg" alt="Figure 6" width="244" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em></strong>7. Lay facing against bodice section with the right sides of each lying against
  the right sides of the other. (Fig. 6.)</p>
<p>8. Starting at the center back of the collars, pin the outer edges of the
  collars and revers together, with the seams meeting exactly. Baste, starting
  from center back. (Fig. 6.)</p>
<p>9. Snip off the pointed corners of collar and revers to eliminate bulk when
  garment is turned right side out. Snip inverted corners A and B diagonally
  to stitching line.</p>
<p>10. Turn garment right side out, carefully pulling points into shape.</p>
<p>11. Tack seam edges together across center back to hold collar in position.</p>
<p>12. In woolen tailored notched collars, the under collar is usually cut on
  the bias and reenforced. In such cases, this would be your second step in
  the procedure.</p>

<p>In a full size pattern, size 14 to 18, the following proportions produced
  a successful muslin.</p>
<p><strong>1. Make the stand on this collar one inch.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. As the closing is extra high and revers short, this style did not require
  more than one-fourth inch shifted to center front to lengthen the folding line.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Plan the break at three inches above bust level.</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. Plan your lap to use conventional one inch buttons.</strong></p>
<p><strong>5. Try making the upper and lower collars identical as you might do for a
  gingham suit dress. That would mean that both collars would have the center
  back, I-H, on the fold.</strong></p>
<p>Notice how the shape of the divisional lines of the jacket have been repeated
  in the style line of the revers to bring further emphasis. For experiment,
  try a rough sketch using these lines inverted and then try to add further interest
  in pockets or other seams which repeat the lines. To produce this design which
  has an extra high closing, use the same basic instructions and the proportions
  suggested above.</p>
<p>NOTE: Before drafting this design, turn back to <a href="#157">page 157</a>; compare the two
  diagrams. Note that the high position of C swings the entire collar portion
  proportionately. Compare the two collars for style lines. Fundamentally, they
  employ the same drafting principle, but each change in the height of the closing,
  or in the width and shape of revers, causes the pattern for each of the following
  examples to change in shape. To become familiar with this phase of designing,
  many models should be made in muslin from original designs proportioned by
  yourself, or random sketches from fashion magazines. Through this drill, students
  soon memorize the steps of procedure and become adept in the use of this principle.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><a name="double" id="double"></a>The<strong><a href="illust/07-161-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',324,225);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/07-161-b-t.jpg" alt="Double breasted style" width="135" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong> Double <strong><a href="illust/07-161-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',306,231);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/07-161-a-t.jpg" alt="Double breasted style" width="140" height="190" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>Breasted Style</em></h3>
<p>In a full size pattern, the following proportions produced a successful muslin.
  Note that, although the break is located on a level with the bust, the extra
  length shifted to the bust is only one-half inch. On a single breasted garment,
  it would be an inch. See set of proportions in summary on <a href="#summary">page
  163</a>.</p>
<p><strong>1. Shift one-half inch to folding line.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Plan full double breasted closing. Note that lap edge is not truly vertical.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Plan lap for use of button one and one-fourth inch in diameter.</strong></p>
<p>NOTE: Step 4 in your draft instructions makes special reference to the length
  of the line D-E when making a pattern for a double breasted garment. Use your
  curve when describing curved shape of the rever portions.</p>
<p>The amount to be added to the folding line through shifting of control will
  vary greatly with individuals. Tailors take a &quot;guide measurement&quot; from
  the center back of the neck down to the desired level of the break. Then the
  tape line is extended to the waist to establish exact height of point C on
  pattern. This permits checking to insure that sufficient length has been pivoted
  into center front before a muslin is made. It is difficult to so alter the
  muslin afterward. <em>Make the folding line a bit too long rather than too short.</em></p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><a name="low" id="low"></a>The <strong><a href="illust/07-162-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',346,475);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/07-162-a-t.jpg" alt="Single breasted type with low closing" width="244" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>Single Breasted Type with Low Closing</em></h3>
<p>The sketch for this design suggests a low stand used at the back. Compare
  it with the sketches shown on the two previous designs. Also note that the
  break of the rever is located just above the waistline, which forms an extra
  long folding line. The following proportions produced a pleasing result in
  muslin when the pattern was drafted from the sketch.</p>
<p><strong>1. Plan the collar stand at only three-fourths of an inch.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Because the folding line is extra long, shift the control to lengthen it
  one and one-fourth inches.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Plan the button to be one inch in diameter.</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. Use normal one-fourth inch extension to make line D-E.</strong></p>
<p><strong>5. Plan wide, generous revers which extend beyond the armscye of the garment
  as shown in the sketch. Note the horizontal line of the top edge of the revers.
  This will give the finished garment a youthful appearance despite the deep
  V closing. If the same low closing were used, with narrow revers, the garment
  would appear mature.</strong></p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><a name="tuxedo" id="tuxedo"></a><strong><a href="illust/07-162-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',357,465);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/07-162-b-t.jpg" alt="Tuxedo closing" width="231" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>Tuxedo Closing</em></h3>
<p>Observe that this design provides for the open or &quot;Tuxedo&quot; style
  of front which eliminates the usual V-shaped neckline. This will mean a few
  minor changes in the method used in the previous designs. The following proportions
  were used to produce a pleasing garment.</p>
<p><strong>1. Make stand of the collar one and one-fourth inches.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. The Tuxedo style front eliminates the need for shifting extra length into
  center front.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Plan the tuxedo points wide enough to accommodate a button one and one-half
  inches wide.</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. Step 4 in your drafting instructions doubles the amount added to
    the line D-E when making a double breasted closing. In this style,
    that rule would be reversed and only one half the amount would be added
  or <em>one-eighth</em>  inch. Upper and lower collars could be made identical
  as for a wash garment.</strong></p>
<p>The area used for the tabs would be built on the rever section as they extend
  down below normal waistline.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><a name="shawl" id="shawl"></a><strong><a href="illust/07-163.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',323,430);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/07-163-t.jpg" alt="Single breasted type with shawl collar" width="237" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>The Single Breasted Type with Shawl Collar</em></h3>
<p>It is possible to cut a shawl collar on the principle of the tailored suit
  collar such as illustrated here. The proportions given were found suitable
  for a size 16 garment.</p>
<p><strong>1. Make the stand of the collar one inch.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Plan the break of the rever at two inches below bust leveL</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Increase length of folding line one inch by shifting control to center
  front.</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. Follow drafting instructions given for tailored suit collar except that
  point J is eliminated.</strong></p>
<p>This produces a garment which has the collar cut in one with the bodice front
  and the shaped seam at the center back. Although in this simple form, it appears
  mature, many interesting designs may be produced from this method. When used
  for house coats, bathrobes and evening coats designed for a double breasted
  closing the same rules which apply to the double breasted tailored notch collars
  would be used to make this collar.</p>
<h3><strong><a name="summary" id="summary"></a></strong>SUMMARY</h3>
<p>After drafting this series of varied tailored suit collars, you have probably
  become aware that variations, aside from the size and the shape of the collar,
  occur in the two basic steps given below. The following proportions represent
  the findings of the instructors and students who spent many hours in comparative
  study by drafting a great variety of designs. This chart may serve as a guide
  for you.</p>
<p><strong>Establishing Length of Line D-E:</strong> varies with style of closing or degree of
  lap used:</p>
<p>Single Breasted: Line D-E equals one-half back neck measurement <em>plus one-fourth
  inch</em>.</p>
<p>Double Breasted: Line D-E equals one-half back neck measurement <em>plus one-half
  inch</em>.</p>
<p>Tuxedo Closing: Line D-E equals one-half back neck measurement <em>plus one-eighth
  inch</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Lengthening Folding Line by Shifting Control to Center Front:</strong> varies with
  height of break of rever&#8212;also with postures of individuals.</p>
<p>At bust level: Shift control to increase folding line <em>three-fourths inch</em>.</p>
<p>One to three inches above: Shift control to increase folding line <em>one-fourth
  inch</em>.</p>
<p>Two inches below bust: Shift control to increase folding line <em>one inch</em>.</p>
<p>Waistline closings: Shift control to increase folding line <em>one and one-fourth
  inches and up</em>.</p>
<p>Tuxedo style closings: No extra length required at folding line.</p>
<p>Extra high chest closings: No extra length required.</p>
<p>Double Breasted styles: At the above mentioned levels, shift control only
  <em>half</em> that normally required for single breasted closing.</p>
<p><strong>When Cutting Collars Involving the Use of Thick Fabrics:</strong> sometimes the outer
  edge of the collar has a tendency to curl. If the width of the finished pattern
  for the upper collar is widened from one quarter to one eighth inch at the
  neck edge, throughout the area which provides a stand, this will correct this
  difficulty. The thicker the fabric being used, the greater the need for the
  increase.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><a name="raised" id="raised"></a><strong><a href="illust/07-164-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',347,720);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/07-164-a-t.jpg" alt="Raised necklines" width="375" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>Raised Necklines</em></h3>
<p>The raised neckline is a favorite with designers because it may be used as
  a substitute for the plain flat collarless neckline which is not so flattering
  to some women. The proportions given below will produce a nicely fitting neckline
  for standard sizes providing for normal head carriage. (Fig. 1)</p>
<p><strong>1. Establish the height of closing three inches above bust level.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. B-C is equal to one half back neck measurement and is squared from the
  shoulder line B.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. D-C represents the stand and is one inch long, squared from point C.</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. From D, square a guide line equal to one half the back neck measurement.
  Label E.</strong></p>
<p><strong>5. The line D-A should be a compound curve. It appears straight when garment
  is worn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>6. The standing neck band is cut in one with the bodice. Provide seams as
  shown in diagrams of final patterns.</strong></p>
<p>NOTE: Because this design called for a high closing, no control was shifted
  to lengthen the edge of the new neckline which is relative to the folding line
  on tailored suit collars you have just been studying. When designing this style
  of neckline with a low closing, first shift control in accordance with the
  summary on the previous page.</p>
<p>When cutting this pattern for one having an <em>erect head carriage</em>,
  this draft should be corrected slightly to give extra length at the top edge
  of
  the neck
  band. When draft has been made, locate point C in the manner shown in upper
  diagram. Move C one fourth inch and then you will have a slight flare from
  E to D. (Fig. 2)</p>
<p>Likewise, when cutting this style of collar for a woman who carries her head
  <em>somewhat forward</em>, the opposite type of curve would be needed to keep
  the collar from gaping awkwardly at the upper edge. In such cases, swing point
  C over one fourth inch in the opposite direction and complete in usual manner.
  Note how this produces a curved collar of the opposite type. (Fig. 3)</p>
<p>If you look for them, you will find many interesting uses for this neckline
  in conjunction with other portions of the design for dresses and coats. It
  is worked into yoke as well as plain styles.</p>
<h3><em><a name="collarless" id="collarless"></a>Collarless Necklines</em></h3>
<p>The plain, collarless neckline is the most difficult for most women to wear
  as its unrelieved line provides little more than a frame for the neck and throat.
  The addition of trimming, small revers, or a collar which has an interesting
  style line, will prove more flattering to most women. Therefore, when planning
  to use such a simple neckline, great care must be taken to give it pleasing
  proportions which are suited to the face, neck and size of the wearer.</p>
<p class="clear"><em><strong><a href="illust/07-165-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',148,694);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/07-165-a-t.jpg" alt="Collarless necklines" width="500" height="95" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em>Fig. A illustrates a square neckline of uninteresting proportions. It is neither
  high nor low and its monotonous proportions do nothing to flatter the wearer.
  Fig. B shows the same neckline lowered to form a rectangle. Note that this
  change will have an effect in slenderizing the neck of the wearer. Fig. C shows
  the broad, squared neckline. As the edge is outside the area of the head and
  neck, it requires perfection of neck and shoulders to be worn. If used for
  a customer having a broad neck and square shoulders, it will reveal and emphasize
  her physical type. Fig. D is a pleasing variation of the square neck. Its broad
  base is flattering. Fig. E shows the straight lines curved to give a still
  softer effect. The drapery and clips invite attention away from the throat.</p>
<p class="clear"><em><strong><a href="illust/07-165-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',161,680);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/07-165-b-t.jpg" alt="Collarless necklines" width="500" height="107" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em></p>
<p class="clear">Fig. F shows a badly proportioned round neck which is monotonous and which
  does nothing for the wearer. It lacks character. Note the improvement shown
  in Fig. G when the line has been brought close to the neck at the sides and
  then lengthened to form an oval. It is a good plan, when fitting a muslin foundation
  pattern to a customer, to experiment with a string of beads and then trace
  in the best type of oval neckline for her.</p>
<p>The &quot;bateau&quot; or boat neckline shown in Fig. H is not suited to many
  women. It broadens the shoulders and will seem to shorten the neck. Therefore,
  it should not be used by stout, plump women.</p>
<p>Fig. I exposes both neck and shoulders, like C, and may be worn only by women
  who have exceptionally beautiful throats. For that reason, it does not appear
  in many evening dresses found in stores.</p>
<p>When planning the V shaped neckline, be sure that the line is straight and
  clean. The narrow shaped V neckline is sophisticated and flattering to the
  greater percentage of women. Therefore, it seems to remain in the fashion picture
  year after year. It has dignity and creates an emotional, dramatic feeling
  when used in evening dresses, hostess gowns and semi-formal apparel. When additional
  drapery is added, as shown in Fig. J, with a focal point of interest appearing
  at the point of the neckline, such as a bow, or jeweled clip, it is most pleasing
  to the young matron or dowager.</p>
<p>Carefully study examples of collarless necklines. Clip those which show careful
  planning. It will help you to appreciate the work of a good designer.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><a name="style" id="style"></a><strong><a href="illust/07-166.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',808,720);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/07-166-t.jpg" alt="Cuff variations" width="266" height="300" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>Cuffs</em></h3>
<p>On this page are illustrated a few basic types of cuffs, with the diagrams
  which give the method which might be used for cutting each. They are not presented
  as a problem, but as a basis for analysis of representative styles. It is hoped
  that they will be a guide for you to develop a method for cutting original
  designs which you may wish to make from time to time. Note that the same principles
  are used for introduction of fullness as has been used in previous problems
  in pattern making.</p>

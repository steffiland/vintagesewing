<p>    <a name="analysis" id="analysis"></a>The exquisite bits of apparel belonging
  to the general classification of lingerie (pronounced lan-jer-ee) are an important
  part of milady's wardrobe. They include
  all pieces of underclothing and other garments designed especially for use
  in the privacy of her boudoir. The group includes nightgowns, slips, panties,
  brassieres, bed jackets, negligee, sleeping pajamas, corsets et cetera. The
  boudoir negligee is not to be confused with the &quot;hostess gown.&quot; The
  former is intended for <em>emergency</em> while the latter is a modern substitute
  for any semi-formal dress except that it is usually purchased for wearing when
  entertaining guests. Lounging pajamas differ from sleeping pajamas. Although
  these flimsy bits of apparel appear fragile and impractical, they are indeed,
quite the opposite!</p>
<p><a name="functional" id="functional"></a>Lingerie, first of all, is functionally designed. By this, the author means
  to say that the garment, aside from being made as beautiful as possible, must
  first be perfectly cut to provide a minimum of bulk but a maximum of comfort.
  Most lingerie must withstand repeated launderings. It therefore may be beautiful,
  but the fabric must still be as durable as possible. When the functional points
  have been created, then whatever beauty is added must be added without loss
  to the functional value of the garment.</p>
<p><a name="requirements" id="requirements"></a>Corset, brassiere and lingerie
  designers become highly specialized in their field. Probably designers have
  labored more diligently over the design for
  a girdle or a slip than any designer has struggled to create a dress or coat.
  Women want a smooth-fitting slip, and although they may require dresses made
  to their measurements, they still expect to buy their slips ready to wear.
  Hence the development of our bias slips. They adjust somewhat to the varying
  contours of women's bodies with a minimum amount of excessive wrinkles. A fortune
  was made on an ingeniously cut pantie which provided for the use of a gusset!
  Many manufacturers patent their designs for slip and underwear patterns and
  each year they add some improvements to the functional design and offer a new
  style made from that same basic pattern. Once a pattern is developed, the other
  changes are relatively simple.</p>
<p>As mentioned previously, most lingerie is made of washable knitted or woven
  fabrics. Occasionally some luxurious garment is shown in a shop and the sales
  girl will mention that it should be dry cleaned. But fabric manufacturers have
  developed such a fine assortment of truly beautiful washable fabrics, most
  lingerie may be laundered carefully with no disastrous results. Lingerie satin,
  crepe de chine, flat crepe, fine muslins and knitted silks and rayons and even
  washable satin and lastex are now to be had in popular priced lines.</p>
<p>The greater portion of lingerie is constructed by machinery. New attachments
  on the sewing machines have reduced the need for handwork and brought simulated
  luxury at popular prices. The fashion conscious woman, who can afford it, will
  want some of her lingerie wardrobe to be hand made, even though she may realize
  that will give it no greater durability. Most hand finished lingerie is made
  outside this country. In some countries, such as Porto Rico and the Philippines,
  our manufacturers have built large finishing factories where the gifted native
  women add their needlework artistry under the direct supervision of American
  stylists. This accounts for the fact that a hand finished garment may be purchased
  here at considerably less than ten dollars.</p>
<p>The person who is especially talented in the creating of intimate apparel
  can find excellent opportunities in the designing field. First must come the
  study of the need for functionalism in the cut of the garment and after that,
  ideas for beautifying the garment may be varied and interesting. Lingerie design
  follows trends suggested by dresses. Nightgowns show pronounced fashion changes.
  Underwear changes to meet the demands of dress silhouettes. A surprising amount
  of beauty is to be found in this highly selective field of women's apparel.</p>
<h3><em><a name="panties" id="panties"></a>Panties, Bloomers etc.</em></h3>
<p>In the past few years corset designers have perfected a modern garment known
  as the &quot;pantie-girdle.&quot; This serves the purpose of the two garments
  and the sale of chemise and panties has lowered. However, you should study
  the two basic patterns which form the basis for most designs for panties or
  the modern version of the &quot;bloomers&quot; of past years.</p>
<h3><em>Straight Panties</em></h3>
<p class="clear">Straight<em><strong><a href="illust/10-220-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',200,242);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/10-220-b-t.jpg" alt="Straight panties" width="216" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em> panties <em><strong><a href="illust/10-220-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',201,261);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/10-220-a-t.jpg" alt="Straight panties" width="233" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em>are developed from the basic slack pattern draft. For the
  uncorseted figures of adolescent girls, such garments may be hemmed and an
  elastic inserted in the hem to give a snug fit at the thigh.</p>
<p>Quite recently a pajama manufacturer introduced a summer sleeping garment
  which had a pajama &quot;short&quot; instead of trouser. His designer placed
  inserts of elastic at each side of the back, and provided the control which
  was adjustable to waistline of wearer.</p>
<p>Notice that the silhouette of this pantie is that of a trouser. When elastic
  is used at the waistline, no placket is necessary. This basic pattern forms
  the basis for many such garments which are made from fine knit fabrics. Some
  models are re-enforced at the seat for more durability.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><a name="simulated" id="simulated"></a><strong><a href="illust/10-220-c.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',183,320);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/10-220-c-t.jpg" alt="Simulated circular panties" width="300" height="163" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>Simulated Circular Panties</em></h3>
<p>Because this style of garment will adjust to fit more variations in figures,
  it is used more frequently. It is made from the semi-circular culotte pattern.
  The usual center front and back seams have been eliminated and the inside leg
  portion has been made into a gusset which is set into the slash placed at the
  center front and back of the main sections of the garment. The setting of the
  gusset requires expert machine operating. If you will inspect some models found
  in the stores, you will recognize the use of this cut, or variations of it.</p>
<p class="clear"><strong><em><a href="illust/10-221-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',396,358);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/10-221-a-t.jpg" alt="Draft of simulated circular panties" width="157" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>1. Cut semi-circular culotte off at desired level.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Cut off inner leg sections at E-D and F-B.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Place these together with normal seam line G-H closed. Trace around them
  and eliminate this seam. Two gusset sections are required for the garment.</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. Original back and front seam lines C-D and A-B are then labeled
    to lay on fold.</strong></p>
<p><strong>5. F and E indicate point to which slash will be made in fabric.</strong></p>
<p><strong>6. Sew gusset sections on line E-F. Set into slashes in body of the garment.</strong></p>
<h3><em><a name="slip" id="slip"></a>Slips</em></h3>
<p>As has been. The designs presented for your analysis
  are selected as being typical styles found available in almost any apparel
  store today.</p>
<p class="clear"><a name="princess" id="princess"></a><strong><em><a href="illust/10-221-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',825,314);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/10-221-b-t.jpg" alt="Princess slip" width="73" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em></strong> As
  mentioned previously in this text, designers have spent countless hours of
  effort in
  designing the &quot;perfect&quot; slip which will adjust to the varying contours
  of women's bodiesFig. 1 shows the &quot;princess&quot; style
  which has vertical seams which achieve the fit in the garment. Because of its
  many vertical seams this is a popular design for slips being
  made to customer's measurements. The sweep at the hemline may be varied as
  desired. In some cases, this style of slip is cut entirely on the bias with
  the lower front and back panel cut double to make the garment &quot;shadow-proof.&quot;</p>
<p>Fig. 2 shows the method for producing the pattern from the basic hip length
  bodice sloper. By introducing an extra dart at H, a close fit is assured at
  the top. This dart is then shifted over into the vertical seam extending down
  over the bust point. Extra hemline sweep is added as for gored skirts.</p>
<p class="clear"><strong><em><a href="illust/10-222-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',337,272);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/10-222-a-t.jpg" alt="Construction of pattern for princess slip" width="139" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em></strong>Fig. 3 shows the construction pattern with the discarded sections removed.
  To provide a snug fit under the breasts and around the diaphragm, draw a compound
  curve from B to C. D-E, being the same length of the original line B-C must
  be lengthened to equal the new curved line B-C. This is accomplished by slashing
  construction pattern horizontally at point A and the extra length provided
  in the final pattern by spreading the sections as needed.</p>
<p>The final pattern would be completed in the usual manner with grain indicators
  marked to intersect with the hip level line. Some designs provide for a double
  of fabric through bust area. This would be made in the same manner as a facing
  from final pattern.</p>
<p>The procedure used for making this slip is the same as that to be used when
  making any full length garment from the hip length bodice sloper. The front
  section being arranged to make the bust and hip lines follow the horizontal
  grain of the fabric will insure a well-hung garment. Later examples in coats
  and one piece dresses will give further practice in the use of this procedure.</p>
<p>A similar style, cut on the bias, eliminates the side seams and inserts elastic
  fabric in area of waistline to cause garment to fit snugly at side waist.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><a name="three" id="three"></a><strong><a href="illust/10-222-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',332,215);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/10-222-b-t.jpg" alt="Bias &quot;bra-top&quot; slip" width="109" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong><a name="braslip" id="braslip"></a>Bias &quot;Bra-top&quot; Slip</em></h3>
<p>Variations of this slip are to be found in most stores. It is usually made
  from a knit fabric or, when cut from lingerie crepe or satin, it is made on
  the bias of the fabric in the skirt portion at least. Because there are no
  vertical seams for fitting, it is best worn by the woman who has no intense
  curves.</p>
<p>The upper section may be designed with the simple double bodice top with adjustable
  shoulder straps or it may be shaped as shown here. In some cases the position
  of the darts will vary or the control may be divided with darts extending from
  raised waistline and the underarm seam.</p>
<p>The control is shifted in the bodice sections as illustrated. The working
  dart is introduced in the front skirt section and then that is shifted to the
  hemline to provide walking room. The normal basic dart appearing in the back
  skirt section is also shifted in a like manner.</p>
<p class="clear">Vertical <em><strong><a href="illust/10-223-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',467,259);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/10-223-b-t.jpg" alt="Back of bra-top slip" width="94" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em>guide<em><strong><a href="illust/10-223-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',436,242);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/10-223-a-t.jpg" alt="Front of bra-top slip" width="93" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em> lines are then drawn upon the final pattern paper and the front
  and back sections are arranged as shown in Figs. 2 and 3. Note how the shaping
  waistline seam is revealed when the two sections are placed against the guide
  line. In the front section, line D-C is the new raised waistline. The distance
  from B to C can be made about one half that distance shown between E and F.
  The remainder of the center front length is absorbed in the bias cut.</p>
<p>In the back section&#8212;because the new waistline starts from the normal
  waistline&#8212;the new seam can absorb all the normal fitting provided
  at the waistline in the slopers.</p>
<p>If a bias slip is cut too narrow through the thighs and at the lower edge,
  it will have a tendency to creep up when the figure is in motion. When such
  slips are ironed, the iron should follow the grain of the fabric by ironing
  in a diagonal motion. This will help to restore the shape the garment had originally
  with each washing. Any garment which is cut with a bias skirt will gradually
  sag when hung in a closet. The only way to avoid that problem is to store it
  flat in a dresser drawer.</p>
<p>When you have cut the pattern for this slip and have tried your results in
  muslin, it will become obvious that, because of the lack of vertical seams,
  this garment may not be made to fit as closely and smoothly as the previous
  princess design. In observing dresses in stores, you will notice that the high
  priced sheer dresses will have well cut slips accompanying them. The less expensive
  garments will have slips which may be made with less material, time and labor.
  The custom designer should select about the same method. The slip will vary
  with the final cost of the garment being made for the customer. The better
  the slip fits, the smoother the dress will look on the customer.</p>
<p>You may see a similar design to this slip which has a panel in the back which
  is cut on the straight of the fabric. That style will improve the fit and not
  add too much cost to the finished garment. In some instances, the back panel
  is cut on the bias. At this writing, lingerie designers are using a new elastic
  fabric which is set under the arms at the waistline. This may solve the problem
  for the customers who want a closely fitted slip with no placket at the waistline.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><a name="biasslip" id="biasslip"></a><strong><a href="illust/10-224.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',404,749);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/10-224-t.jpg" alt="Novelty slip" width="332" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>Novelty Slip:</em></h3>
<p>This style of slip introduces four seams, each one of which contributes to
  the fitting of the garment. By laying the pattern on a true bias of the fabric,
  this will aid in adjusting the fabric to the contours of the figure. It is
  given here in a simple form, as a problem for cutting, but it might be trimmed
  with sections of lace if desired.</p>
<p>Because this slip has only four seams instead of the six fitting seams of
  the princess style, it would be best suited to a slender woman or a full figure
  with a large waistline.</p>
<p><strong>1. Start by making the construction patterns for front and back bodices as
  shown in Figs. 2 and 3. Draw in the desired line of the top as shown by the
  dotted lines. Cut away the remaining area and discard.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. The back dart is eliminated by folding it in and pinning. Draw in the angle
  of center front dart and add the small fitting dart at the top.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Fig. 4 shows how the bodice section should appear when darts have been
  folded and control shifted to center front.</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. Use the four gored skirt pattern which you studied on </strong><a href="mpd-08.html#narrow">page
      185</a><strong> as the basis
  for the skirt portion. Arrange the sections as shown in Fig. 4.</strong></p>
<p><strong>5. If you wish additional walking room at the center front, this may be added
  as is shown by dotted line A- -B. Seam allowance would then be added as shown.</strong></p>
<p><strong>6. The shaped facing would be made from the final pattern. As the facing is
  cut narrow at the back, it would serve as a trimming and yet finish off the
  top of the garment. For durability, the facing could be cut much wider, if
  desired. If the slip were to be made of dull surface lingerie crepe, the facing
  cut of satin would give an added note of interest and trim.</strong></p>
<p><strong>7. The center back zipper closing would facilitate getting into the
    garment. </strong></p>
<p> A satisfactory test may be made of this design by cutting one-half
      the garment
      and then pinning or basting the side seams together.</p>
<p>NOTE: This style of slip would be adaptable to an evening length garment.
  This completes your study of methods used for cutting slips. From this information,
  you should be able to originate a wide variety of designs as desired. The method
  used for making these full length garments is that used in making coats or
  dresses which have no seam at the normal waistline. Space will be devoted to
  those in <a href="mpd-11.html">Chapter Eleven</a>.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><a name="bra" id="bra"></a><strong><a href="illust/10-225-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',194,159);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/10-225-a-t.jpg" alt="Corset cover" width="139" height="174" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>Brassieres</em></h3>
<p>During the late nineteenth century and the early twentieth century, the camisole,
  or corset-cover, was worn under blouses and dresses. Women who had an overdeveloped
  bust wore a blouse which had a fitted lining or a tightly fitted corset-cover
  to maintain a smoother contour. Shortly after the last world war, the social
  order changed. Women bobbed their hair, entered the business world and gained
  their right to vote. As is usually the case, fashions interpreted the new era
  and skirts became shorter and the &quot;boyish&quot; figure became the vogue.
  Waistlines were indefinite, but the bust was confined with the new &quot;bandeau
  brassiere.&quot;</p>
<p>Fortunately, this unhealthful garment was abandoned as the natural figure
  returned to fashion. The scanty garment remained, but it was changed to conform
  to the natural contour of the breasts. Since then, the corsets and brassieres
  have improved until today, a woman may find a wide choice of styles to suit
  her specific requirements in almost any price bracket. <a name="bias" id="bias"></a><a name="modern" id="modern"></a>Not only does the 1942
  brassiere mold the shape of the breast but it is designed to support it as
  well. It has been designed to serve a definite functional use. It has also
  been designed to bring comfort and serviceability. The variation in price usually
  determines delicacy in fabric, perfection of cut and the minimum amount of
  bulk.</p>
<p>Much credit should be given to the diligent designers who have specialized
  in the foundation garments. They usually work with models as they must study
  the problems of countless types of women. Usually they have had experience
  selling foundation garments before they entered the creative phases of the
  work. Some understudied experts for several years before they became head designers.
  They have contributed greatly to the enviable figures of American women. </p>
<p>Because
  there is such a wide choice of styles available in the stores, one seldom has
  occasion to create a single garment. Although most large cities have a few
  shops which specialize in foundation garments and negligee where a large stock
  of ready-to-wear is carried, there is little occasion for &quot;made-to-measurement&quot; service.
  A few small alterations will usually be all that is necessary.</p>
<p><a name="brassieres" id="brassieres"></a>Herewith are shown a few representative types which show the functional designs
  which are created to meet needs of customers:</p>
<p class="clear"><em><strong><a href="illust/10-225-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',207,288);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/10-225-b-t.jpg" alt="Figures 1 and 2" width="251" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>Fig. 1:</em> Was designed especially for the 1940 low, V-necked evening gowns.
  Elastic edges on the sides of the front assure modesty to die wearer.</p>
<p><em>Fig. 2:</em> is a style designed for the teen age girl with partially developed
  bust. It is light weight and cup shaped feature gives firm line desired.</p>
<p><em>Fig. 3:</em> is designed for the woman with the overdeveloped, sagging bust. Note
  stitched under portions to give support where needed. Some such designs show
  light boning instead of re-enforced stitched area.</p>
<p class="clear"><em><strong><a href="illust/10-226-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',310,338);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/10-226-a-t.jpg" alt="Figures 3 through 5" width="192" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>Fig. 4:</em> is a lacy creation having wide center front panel to divide the breasts.
  This foundation garment would be best for the gown having drapery in bust area.</p>
<p><em>Fig. 5: </em>was designed in 1938 for wearing with popular strapless evening gowns
  and bathing suits. Note gusset of elastic.</p>
<p><a name="brapattern" id="brapattern"></a>Methods given for producing bathing suit tops would be used to cut patterns
  for brassieres. Special model form should be used in such instances.</p>
<h3><em>Nightgowns and Panamas</em></h3>
<p>Like all well designed clothing, sleeping garments of today are less bulky
  than in our grandmother's day. Yet they are functionally designed to give comfort
  to the wearer. In the previous era, only women of wealth could afford nightgowns
  which were flattering but today, thanks to our able woven and knit fabric manufacturers,
  the modern woman may have flattering sleeping garments of delicate fabrics
  and colors and yet they will be serviceable and moderately priced.</p>
<p>Assuming that the fabric is beautiful to the eye, the next point of consideration
  is the cut. And there must be comfort. Comfort as to warmth and as to the cut
  of the garment. Most of the garments sold in the stores are &quot;year-round&quot; models.
  However, if you will notice, in the hot summer months, stores feature <a name="nightgowns" id="nightgowns"></a>nighties
  and pajamas made from extra sheer cotton and synthetic fabrics which are actually
  cooler than the usual garment. Now that American women have become actively
  interested in skiing, hunting, camping and rugged ranch living it is natural
  that the primitive heating conditions of some mountain cabins will create a
  demand for extra warm sleeping garments. As a result, there has been an increasing
  demand for fleecy nightgowns and a subsequent revival of cotton flannel. A
  modern fabric used to meet this demand is a &quot;brushed rayon&quot; which
  simulates wool in appearance.</p>
<p class="clear"><em><strong><a href="illust/10-226-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',237,334);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/10-226-b-t.jpg" alt="Nightgown with tie belt and one with waistband on bias" width="253" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em>A few general rules will apply to designing the pattern for a nightgown. The
  garment should be wide enough in the skirt to permit freedom of the limbs while
  sleeping. If sleeves are to be used, they should be cut to provide the necessary
  freedom of the arms. Whenever possible, the waistline should be adjustable.
  This may be accomplished with a tie-belt which runs through the loops placed
  at the waistline under the arms. Or, a set-in waistline band at the front may
  extend on into a sash belt across the back. Drop shoulders are not popular
  because they have a tendency to tear out with the movement of the arms. Tiny
  straps are not practical because they cannot be made durable enough. Therefore
  the sleeveless types, with wider areas over the shoulders, are the more popular.
  <em><strong><a href="illust/10-227-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',236,337);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/10-227-a-t.jpg" alt="Short puffed sleeves, flounced hem" width="257" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em>If short puffed sleeves are desired, some designers leave the sleeve unattached
  under the arm, finishing off the garment and the sleeve with a tiny, firm binding.
  This will add the freedom needed.</p>
<p>Like dresses, nightgowns fall into three basic classifications: the strictly
  tailored, mannish types; the semi-tailored and the distinctly dressy, elaborate
  feminine types. Designs for nightgowns usually follow the current trends in
  dresses to some degree. When special interest is being focused upon hemlines,
  then you may expect to see nighties having flounces on the hemline. When puffed
  sleeves were in vogue, both nightgowns and bed-jackets had puffed sleeves.
  The same is true with capes, circular skirts et cetera.</p>
<p>In recent years, sleeping &quot;ensembles&quot; have found a ready market.
  These include the nightgown with an additional negligee which matches. Some
  are padded and quilted to give added warmth. Others may be made with a contrasting
  lining for extra modesty. Combinations of nightgowns and pastel flannel dressing
  robes which match are found in the more expensive lines.</p>
<p>An ingenious refugee from war-torn Europe was confined to an American hospital
  for a few weeks and while there she was so annoyed with the purely functional
  hospital nightgowns which reach just below the knees and tie in the back, she
  designed similar models of silk which included the same functional features.
  She soon had more orders than she could fill!</p>
<h3><em>Sleeping Pajamas</em></h3>
<p>When sleeping pajamas were first adopted by women, many of the first models
  were not comfortable. The pattern makers&#8212;in an attempt to make the garments
  loose and roomy&#8212;made the mistake of lowering the crotch without widening
  the leg of the garment proportionately. The results were most unsatisfactory&#8212;like
  wearing a glove with too short fingers. In the chapter in this text which explains
  the method used for lowering the armscye, you were taught that when the armscye
  is lowered, the sleeve must be widened at the biceps accordingly. The same
  is true when the crotch is lowered on a trouser-like garment. The &quot;Frontier
  Pants,&quot; being cut high in the crotch to serve a functional need for horseback
  riding are proportionately tight in the thighs. However, the most comfortable
  sleeping pajama has the crotch depth of the average slack suit. It will provide
  ample room for movement of the limbs while sleeping.</p>
<p>Except in some special designs for children's garments, pajamas are usually
  made two-pieced. Due to the variation in torso lengths in adults, the one-pieced
  garments would only fit a limited number of people. Hence the popularity of
  the two-pieced models. Actual sleeping pajamas are usually quite simple in
  cut and trim to insure ease in the laundering. Lounging pajamas, which may
  be dry-cleaned, are sometimes quite elaborate.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><a name="hostess" id="hostess"></a><strong><a href="illust/10-228.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',513,241);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/10-228-t.jpg" alt="Hostess gown" width="90" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>Hostess Gowns</em></h3>
<p>Entirely unlike nightgowns, sleeping pajamas or negligee, this group of garments
  are a form of apparel for wear in the entire home. Lounging pajamas resemble
  a dress more than the sleeping garments and the fabrics are luxurious as to
  color and texture. Some women want them to harmonize with the color scheme
  of the house. They are modern in origin, filling an existing need for suitable
  lounging apparel for casual evenings at home whether guests are being entertained
  or not.</p>
<p>The hostess gown is full length, like an informal dinner dress. When it has
  been selected to harmonize with the home decorative scheme, it is reserved
  in the wardrobe for that purpose. Velvet, plain and figured silk crepes, metallics
  and other glamorous fabrics are usually used. The hostess pajama-suit serves
  a like purpose and would be made of similar fabrics.</p>
<p><a name="housecoat" id="housecoat"></a>The &quot;house coat&quot; or &quot;breakfast coat&quot; is an outgrowth of
  the hostess gown. Women enjoyed the hostess gown because it enveloped them
  completely. When women started to wear cotton slacks for the busy hours of
  the morning, a designer started producing the cotton house coats which proved
  to be far more attractive and they soon rose in favor. <a name="fabrics" id="fabrics"></a>The modern housecoat
  is usually made of gingham, cotton pique or calico and it should be crisp,
  fresh and becoming. The same pattern which might be used for a velvet hostess
  gown might be used to make a cotton house coat.</p>
<p>Women of moderate means can now enjoy the luxury of extra garments of this
  type. Modern business girls find that it gives them a definite mental lift
  to shed their business clothing and slip into an inexpensive garment of this
  type after a difficult day at the office. It is quite correct to wear when
  receiving casual drop-in visitors and, due to its simple cut, it may either
  be laundered or dry-cleaned inexpensively. Every woman and girl should try
  to manage to possess at least one such garment in the wardrobe. There is nothing
  quite so depressing as to see one trailing around in a flannel bathrobe or
  a jaded negligee. A few yards of twenty-five cent cotton percale can produce
  a most attractive garment which will endure for months and be a constant joy
  to the wearer.<br />

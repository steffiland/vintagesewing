  <p>THE increased popularity of trousers arid shorts for sports, holiday,
and general wear has focused much attention on these nether garments. In the
lay Press many professed critics have given their views on the suitability or
otherwise of bifurcated garments when worn by the feminine figure. In the
majority of comments, emphasis has been laid on the rather untidy appearance
presented at the back of these garments over the hips in comparison with a
well-cut skirt. Now there is a reason for this criticism, and it is justified
by the majority of the garments seen. The suggestion of untidiness which has
called forth unfavourable comment is the fault of the cutter, and the cutter
alone. This may seem rather a hard statement, but it is fully justified. We
have only to look around at trousers in general, apart from those cut for
women, to see in these garments an equally untidy appearance at the seat.</p>
  <p>Like every other section of garment cutting, trousers cutting is still
carried out on the same lines as those applicable perhaps ten to twenty years
ago. With men's trousers cutting, this may not be such a mistake, but in
cutting ladies' trousers and shorts, or for that matter any garments of this
character, we have to take into account the remarkable change in the contours
of the feminine figure in the last few years. The change may not be so
pronounced in elderly women, but in those most likely to wear shorts and
trousers, in other words the younger generation, the change of figure is very
pronounced.</p>
<p>The author has a cutting book and in it the proportionate hip size for a
26-inch waist girth is given as 42 inches. Another cutting book gives a waist
girth of 24 inches to agree with a hip circumference of 40 inches. The modern
woman in proportion to the former example would probably at the most measure
37 inches over the hips, and, in the latter instance, most of the women of 24
inches waist circumference the author has measured have been about 35 to 36
inches over the hips. These are not isolated instances; in the majority of
cases hip measurements these days are from 3 to 5 inches less in proportion
to given waist girths than those appertaining fifteen to twenty years ago.</p>
<p>Obviously, a cutting system arranged for the former proportions would be
seriously out of gear when adapted to the modern proportions, but, as well as
this inexactitude, there is a fallacy in the minds of cutters that ease of
movement in shorts and trousers or similar garments can only be achieved by
the addition of ample folds of material wedged into the seat seam over the
hips, to be kept in reserve for all possible movements of the trunk and
legs!</p>
<p>One would visualize women as continually stooping to pick up pins from the
floor by the exaggerated allowances of material infused into shorts and
trousers. The modern woman is, however, becoming more conscious of the
appearance presented by her garments in wear, and over matters of style she
knows as much or more than the tailor or dressmaker. She usually knows what
she wants and expects the maker to interpret her wishes to the letter. The
days are past when the tailor or dressmaker could lead the client away from
&quot;sticky&quot; points; the author, for one, is pleased over this, for
nothing acts more as a spur to endeavour than the attaining of an apparent
impossibility. He has been told that it is impossible to have freedom of
movement in trousers and shorts without this surplus untidy mass of material
lying over the hips. He must disagree with this idea, and his designs of the
trouser-skirt and shorts-skirt prove definitely that it is possible and, what
is more, practical to cut these garments without all this excessive reserve
of material.</p>
<p>Old ideas die hard and this allowing for stooping is one of the oldest and
hardiest. Admittedly, it is advisable to allow a slight increase of length in
the seat seam, but nowhere nearly as much as usually allowed, and it is
pleasing to see that some of the brighter and perhaps younger members of the
trade are experimenting with much less provision allowances than they have
been taught to make. Experience is only of use if it is modern and consonant
with the times. We can admire an elderly cutter who really is not afraid to
scrap all his established ideas and branch out in new paths, but
unfortunately the majority of cutters are slow to learn new systems and
prefer to practise out-of-date methods and have the painful necessity of
making alterations than to learn from the younger generation.</p>
<p>Recently the author was in conversation with a stranger on the top of an
omnibus. He was an elderly man of perhaps sixty or so years, and, as most men
do when talking to someone considerably younger than themselves, he spoke of
the terrific increase of movement of the modern world in comparison with that
in his young days. But the gem of his conversation was that he remarked, more
or less as follows: &quot;I just can't stand men of my age who will insist on
talking about their many years of experience when speaking to a younger man.
They just bore me, and I am glad to get away from them, for their trouble is
that the experience they are so proud of is really many years old and quite
out of touch with modern ideas. After all, experience is of no value unless
it is up with the times, and I, for one, am glad I am living in these days,
for there is always something new coming out.&quot;</p>
<p>But the final touch was perhaps the most amusing; he remarked that
&quot;in all probability when he was buried he would be wrapped up in a
shroud of some new-fangled cut!&quot; A refreshing outlook for a man of his
years and one very welcome in these days when the tendency is for age to
decry youth.</p>
<p>But to return to the more serious subject after this diversion.</p>
<p>The factor that governs free movement is that of stride-room or length
from back to front between the insides of the thighs. If there is
insufficient distance from back to front in the fork quantity no amount of
surplus material in the seat seam will allow the garment to permit the wearer
either to walk or to bend freely; every time the legs moved forward,
restriction would be felt round the thighs. Providing we have sufficient
allowance in the fork quantity for stride-room, we can practically ignore
making additions of surplus material in the seat seam for walking or
stooping. The looseness of the fork provides for both actions of the trunk
and legs.</p>
<p>In the drafts of trouser-skirts and shorts-skirts no provision has been
made for stooping by allowing a surplus quantity in the seat seam; only when
the garment is required to fit very closely round the thighs is an addition
of extra length really indispensable. In the days when men's trousers were
cut very tight at the thigh, knee and bottom edge a greater addition of
surplus length in the seat seam was essential; whereas to-day, with the
wide-cut legs, less surplus length is needed, and the garments do not
restrict the free movement of the limbs to such an extent.</p>
<p>The width of the legs to which modern trousers and shorts are cut permits
of free movement of the legs almost independently of the garment, which fits
at the waist only. In the author's opinion, the fault lies in the adaptation
of breeches systems to the cutting of trousers and shorts, owing to these
garments being a modern innovation, with the result that they are in a
trial-by-experiment stage. In the cutting of breeches and jodhpurs, the
allowance for stooping has a definite purpose, for the position of the rider
on the horse approximates to a stooping position all the time, and it does
not matter greatly how the breeches appear when the rider is off the
horse.</p>
<p>The allowance for stooping added to the length of the seat seam is called
the &quot;seat angle,&quot; which means the angle of divergence from the
perpendicular of the seat seam which, when returned to the perpendicular,
produces a certain quantity of length and contour shape in a similar manner
that the bust dart produces contour shape over the bust.</p>
<p>The seat angle is bound up with waist suppression, for the reduction of
the waist by means of darts produces contour shape in a similar manner to the
seat-angle principle. But darts only produce shape and not length, and to
provide for more length in the seat seam this must be added to the shape
provided by the closing-out of the waist darts.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><a href="illust/198.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,649);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/198-t.jpg" alt="Figure 198" width="210" height="194" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig198" id="fig198"></a>Fig. 198 (a)</h3>
<p>Fig. 198 (a) represents the back section of the trouser-skirt basis draft
with three darts marked to reduce the waist correctly to the finished size.
Now it must be seen that to increase the length of the seat seam from 1 to 4
and 2, it will be necessary to insert a wedge of material in the line from 4
to 5 and 6, the most prominent part of the seat.</p>
<p>Again, if the back waist suppression darts are scientifically correct, and
they are closed out by the pattern being cut through from 4 to 6 and 7, the
resultant wedge of material inserted at 4 to nothing at 7 will be the same,
no matter whether three or one dart is closed out of the waist seam.
Therefore, the waist suppression governs the seat angle to a great degree in
its fundamental principles. If we do not close out all the darts at the
waist, a consequent reduction of length in the seat seam will be manifest,
while, conversely, if all the darts are closed out, the increase of length in
the seat seam will be at its greatest extent. The point is that a varied
number of seat angles are available, from the &quot;straight&quot; angle
giving less length but more contour shape by larger waist darts, to the more
&quot;crooked&quot; seat angle giving most length but less shape as there are
no darts to infuse the same; or else a reduction of the length of the waist
darts would give a correspondingly easier-fitting garment over the seat, as
the inset wedge would be placed higher up in the seat seam. The correct seat
angle can be determined by practical experiment and the size of the waist
governs this angle; a larger waist than normal would, by reducing less from
the back waist darts, produce a seat angle less acute than that of a waist
circumference disproportionately smaller than normal in comparison with the
seat girth.</p>
<p>The seat angle ultimately decided as correct is subject to variation for
special purposes, as when adapted for breeches or jodhpurs to give an
increased quantity of length for the position in which the wearer is usually
seated. For obvious reasons, a garment cut to present a clean appearance at
the seat when the wearer is standing will be unsuitable if the wearer spends
most of her time in a seated position. One might just as well state that an
ordinary set-in sleeve is suitable and the nearest to perfection for a person
addicted to strap-hanging in tube trains! Cutting is not a matter of rigid
adherence to rules, but an adaptation of system to the purpose of creating
garments to agree with the use to which they are put and to present an
appearance of fit at the same time.</p>
<h3>Figs. 198 (b), (c), and (d)</h3>
<p>Figs. 198 (b), (c), and (d) show respectively the effect of closing out
two waist darts, all the darts, and one slightly larger dart to obtain
correspondingly three different seat angles, each, however, pivoting from an
identical point on the vertical seat seam from 1 to 2 at 4. Now if a line is
taken through 1 to 4, it will intersect the horizontal seat line from 3 to 2
at point A in Fig. 198 (b). In Fig. 198 (c) the intersection will be higher
up at B from A, giving a greater angle and more length from 4 to 4, whereas
in Fig. 198 (d) the reverse is seen and the intersection is at C. The point
where the line intersects the vertical from 3 to 2 is denoted by X in each of
the above illustrations.</p>
<p>Consequently, if the waist size is smaller or, in other words, the
quantity reduced by the back waist darts is greater, the angle in each
instance will be more acute; the converse follows in the event of a
disproportionately larger waist circumference. Therefore, if point A remains
constant, to achieve the greater angle for a smaller waist girth, point X
must recede more towards point 3 and, conversely, to decrease the angle and
to allow for a greater waist girth, reducing less from the back waist darts,
point X must be placed at a greater distance from 3.</p>
<p>Of the three different diagrams, Fig. 198 (b) is the most effective in
practice, giving a clean-hanging garment with ample freedom of movement
achieved by the easy fork allowance.</p>
<p>The fork quantity is that amount necessary to cover the insides of the
thighs between the legs. It is an addition to the overall seat girth and is
derived from the seat circumference. For additional ease of movement the fork
quantity is increased from the required amount at the top of the leg seam to
run into the original leg seam in a gradual curve. Separate from the fork
quantity is the addition made for stride-room. We could cut a garment fitting
the figure perfectly by making no provision for stride, and this garment
would be satisfactory until the wearer moved and then it would restrict the
pivoting movement of the legs immediately. So an addition to the close fork
quantity is made for stride-room. Of course, if the garment is not in close
proximity to the limbs, a certain amount of freedom can be obtained without
stride provision, but when the garment is close to the limbs it is necessary
to have this quantity in direct proportion to the freedom desired.</p>
<p>As has been stated previously, modern trousers and shorts do not restrict
the limbs by being close-fitting at the thigh and knee, so the stride-room
factor becomes also useful as a means of providing ease throughout the
garment in wear.</p>
<h3>TROUSERS CUTTING</h3>
<h3 class="clear"><a name="cutting" id="cutting"></a><em><a href="illust/199.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,431);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/199-t.jpg" alt="Figure 199" width="137" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig199" id="fig199"></a>Preliminary Trousers-cutting System
(Fig. 199)</h3>
<p>The preliminary trousers system illustrates the drafting of the topsides.
The tops are plain without pleats, but with a dart suppressing the waist over
the prominent hip bone in front.</p>
<p>The measures for trousers are taken by seating the customer on a chair and
then measuring up from the chair seat to the point where the tops of the
trousers are required in the waist. The sideseam length is taken from the
same point at the waist to the length desired, and the difference between the
two measurements is calculated as the length of leg. Waist and seat measures
are taken in the usual manner, the waist fairly tightly and the seat measure
easy. Widths of leg at the knee and the bottom are a matter of style and
subject to variation each season.</p>
<p>Measures for the preliminary draft are as follows&#8212;</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>Waist = 26 inches.</li>
	<li>Hips = 37 inches.</li>
	<li>Sideseam length = 40 inches.</li>
	<li>Body rise, measured from the chair level to the waist line = 11&frac12;
inches.</li>
	<li>Leg length is the difference between the body rise and the sideseam
length = 28&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>Knee width = 25 inches.</li>
	<li>Bottom width = 24 inches.</li>
	</ul>
<p>The last two measures are ample in width for all ladies' trousers except
for, perhaps, beach pyjamas.</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>Working scale = half the hip measure = 18&frac12; inches.</li>
	</ul>
<p>To draft&#8212;</p>
<p>Commence by drawing the construction line from X.</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>1 from X = the body-rise quantity plus &frac12; inch for turning in the
tops.</li>
	<li>3 from X = the total sideseam length = 40 inches plus &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>The knee position is located at 2, half the distance from 1 to 3 plus 2
inches from 3.</li>
	<li>Square out from the above points.</li>
	<li>4 from X = the hip level = 8 inches below the waist line.</li>
	<li>5 from 1 = one-fourth of the seat measure plus &frac12; inch for two
seams.</li>
	<li>Square up from 5 to 6 to intersect the line squared out from X.</li>
	<li>The front fork quantity from 7 to 5 = one-sixth of the scale plus &frac12;
inch.</li>
	<li>8 from 5 = &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>Join 8 to 6.</li>
	<li>9 from 5 = one-sixth of the scale.</li>
	<li>Square down from 9 to locate points 10 and 11 on the knee and bottom
lines.</li>
	<li>12 from 10 = one-fourth of the knee measure net.</li>
	<li>13 from 11 = one-fourth of the bottom measure.</li>
	<li>14 from 11 = one-fourth of the bottom measure.</li>
	<li>15 from 10 = one-fourth of the knee measure.</li>
	<li>Line from 4 to 16.</li>
	<li>Measure from 6 to 17 one-fourth of the total waist circumference plus
&frac12; inch for seams.</li>
	<li>18 from 17 = &frac34; inch for a dart at the front waist.</li>
	<li>19 from 6 = &frac12; inch.</li>
	</ul>
<p>The above are the construction points of the top-sides and to superimpose
the lines proceed as in the second diagram in Fig. 199.</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>Shape the fork run from 19 to 7 in a gradual curve, making point 20 from
8 equal to half the distance from 5 to 7 as a guide point.</li>
	<li>Shape the inside leg seam from 7 to 15 and 14 and the bottom edge run
from 14 to 13.</li>
	<li>Shape the sideseam from 18 to 4 and continue down to 12 and 13 from
4.</li>
	<li>Shape the waist line from 18 to 19 and reduce the quantity shown from 17
to 18 from the dart at 21, making the dart 6 inches in length to point
22.</li>
	</ul>
<p>This completes the draft of the trousers topsides.</p>
<h5>THE UNDERSIDES</h5>
<p class="clear"><em><a href="illust/plate-02.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,438);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/plate-02-t.jpg" alt="Style illustration of Figure 200" width="147" height="210" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><em><a href="illust/200.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,263);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/200-t.jpg" alt="Figure 200" width="100" height="247" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig200" id="fig200"></a>To produce the draft of the undersides (Fig. 200), the location of the
seat angle is decided and fixed as one-fourth of the waist measure up from 5

	<ul class="small">
	<li>23 from 5 for the seat-angle location = one-fourth of the waist measure
= 6&frac12; inches.</li>
	</ul>
<p>For trousers intended for walking and smart wear, point 24 is located at
one-third the distance from 5 to 7. This point requires variation to suit the
different purposes for which bifurcated garments are intended, as will be
seen in the future drafts of riding breeches and jodhpurs.</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>25 is located from point 26, which is one-fourth of the waist
measurement plus 2 inches from the seat angle line, the 2 inches of increase
being taken up by two &frac14;-inch seams plus 1&frac12; inches for the back
waist
dart. 25 is 1 inch above the waist line from 6 to 18 (Fig. 199).</li>
	<li>27 from 26 = one-sixth of the scale for the position of the back waist
dart.</li>
	<li>Reduce the quantity allowed for the dart equally each side of point 27
to 28 and 29.</li>
	<li>Square down from 29 to 30 6 inches.</li>
	<li>Shape out the back dart from 29 to 30 and 28 to 30.</li>
	<li>31 from 23 = half the hips measure plus 2 inches for ease and seams,
i.e. 20&frac12; inches, less the distance from 4 to 16.</li>
	<li>Shape the sideseam from 26 to 31 and in a gradual run to meet the
topside seam run at 12.</li>
	<li>32 from 25 = &frac14; inch of seat seam spring.</li>
	<li>By pivoting from point 15, sweep from 7 to 33 the stride-room quantity
of 2 inches.</li>
	<li>34 from 15 = 1 inch for the four seams necessary.</li>
	<li>35 from 14 = 1 inch.</li>
	<li>Shape the inside leg seam from 33 to 34 and 35.</li>
	<li>Shape the seat seam from 32 to 23 and 33 as shown to complete the
drafting of the undersides for plain-top trousers.</li>
	</ul>
<p>Both darts are to be sewn out in the marks or otherwise a seam is cut
inside each sewing line.</p>

<p>Smart trousers for sports and beach wear are usually made with four pleats
and a top waistband and are tailored like their masculine counterparts. The
waistband is usually made narrow in width and is often slotted at the back
waist to allow back straps to function from inside the sideseams.</p>
<p>Pleated trousers must be cut wider over the seat and thigh measures than
plain trousers to allow the pleats to function without gaping open in
wear.</p>
<p>Measures for the draft are as follows&#8212;</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>Waist = 26 inches.</li>
	<li>Hips = 37 inches.</li>
	<li>Body rise = 11&frac12; inches.</li>

<h3>SHORTS CUTTING</h3>
<p>There are many designs of shorts to be seen on the market these days, from
the perfectly plain boyish cut to the multi-pleated, one-piece shorts dresses
combining shorts and bodice in one. Other shorts are cut on the skirt
principle and resemble a flared skirt in wear, while others have pleats at
the side and centre front to disguise the shorts appearance.</p>
<p>The addition of hip yokes from which emanate knife and inverted pleats is
a feature of interest, and the author proposes to describe shorts cutting
from the plain styles to the one-piece designs.</p>
<p>Shorts are one of the offending garments from the fitting point of view.
Unless they are really well cut, they can present an extremely inelegant
appearance, and the author, for one, must heartily concur with the
expressions of disapproval heard. The. fact remains, however, that shorts can
be cut to hang perfectly straight at the back and front from the waistband
without a surplus quantity of loose material at the seat seam, and also cut
to disguise almost entirely the fact that the garment has legs.</p>

<p>This completes the drafting of the undersides of the shorts and the
following drafts will illustrate the method adopted for allowing for pleats
of various types from the basis pattern.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a name="allow" id="allow"></a><em><a href="illust/204.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,681);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/204-t.jpg" alt="Figure 204" width="220" height="193" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig204" id="fig204"></a>Allowing for the Pleats (Fig. 204)</h3>
<p>The general principles of pleat allowances in shorts are as
follows&#8212;</p>
<p>Cut through from 22 to 19 at the bottom edge. Fig. 204 illustrates the
procedure.</p>
<p>Allow 6 inches for the front inverted pleat from 22 to 22A and from 19 to
19A as shown, and then divide the distances from 22 to 22A and 19 to 19A by
half to find points 19B and 22B and to mark the inside crease line of the
inverted pleat. The centre front pleat should be sewn down to a point level
with the fork line to achieve a completely divided skirt appearance, and then
should be stitched on each side of the centre front seam to keep the pleat in
position and give a &quot;finish&quot; to the fronts.</p>
<p>The front side inverted pleat is inserted from 16 and 17 to 18 and 12 by
opening out the pattern and inserting 5 to 6 inches of extra cloth as
required by the width of the pleat.</p>
<p>The dart from 16 and 17 to 18 and 18A should be machined out and then the
pleat halved to form the invert, and the two edges of the pleat from 16 to 18
and from 17 to 18A should be sewn out from the inside downwards for a
distance of 8 inches. After the pleat has been divided into halves at the
back, it should be secured on the outside by stitching through on each side
of the seams to the same distance down as the inside has been stitched.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a name="undersides" id="undersides"></a><em><a href="illust/205.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,494);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/205-t.jpg" alt="Figure 205" width="240" height="187" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig205" id="fig205"></a>The Undersides Pleat Allowances
(Fig. 205)</h3>
<p>Cut through the pattern from 22 to 19 and then allow 6 inches from 22 to
22A and from 19 to 19A for the centre back inverted pleat.</p>
<p>Mark the centre crease line of the pleat from 19B to 22B as
illustrated.</p>
<p>Cut through the pattern from 28 and 29 to 27 and 31 and then allow 6
niches from 27 to 27A and from 31 to 31A for the side back inverted pleat.</p>
<p>Find the centre of the distance from 28 to 29 to locate point 28B.</p>
<p>27B is located midway between 27 and 27A and 31B is located at midway
between 31 and 31A for the centre of the side inverted pleat.</p>
<p>It is always advisable to carry the pleats at centre and side all the way
up to the waistband as this gives far greater support to the pleat and
prevents the inside edges of the pleat dropping below the level of the hem
line.</p>
<p>This completes the method of allowing for the pleats, and similarly any
additional pleats may be added to the shorts in positions where desired.</p>

<p>The one-piece shorts dress is cut by adding the shorts outline pattern to
a suitable bodice pattern outline, a seam being placed through the back
waist. The fronts of the bodice may be cut in one piece with the topsides of
the shorts and reduced to the waist by darts or manipulation as described in
the chapter on <a href="lgcm-10.html">Dress Cutting</a>. In view of the fact that the garment is stepped
into, it is advisable not to cut the waist to fit the figure tightly as for
shorts; in any case, a &quot;sporty&quot; garment of this character needs
ease for freedom of movement. The waist measurement of the bodice governs the
reduction by darts and suppression of the waist of the shorts section. If the
bodice waist is cut easier, the effect will be that the seat angle will
become less acute as the proportion of the waist size increases over the
normal hip measurement. This becomes automatically adjusted as the seat angle
is governed by the waist circumference in its definition.</p>

<p>The draft is without seam allowance for the convenience of allying the
bodice of a dress with the shorts system. Therefore, when cutting from the
material, provision must be made for all seam allowances, except in the
matter of darts, which, as usual, are sewn out in the marks.</p>
<p>The collar for this garment is drafted in a similar manner to the
single-breasted collar for jackets, with the exception of a narrower
stand.</p>
<p>Very often one-piece shorts dresses are cut away at the front and back
shoulders in a similar manner to a backless tennis dress. The same system is
used, but care must be taken to ensure the top edge of the bodice at the back
being a close fit to the figure, and, to that end, the usual suppression
lines from the back waist are tapered out to the blade as described for
close-fitting dress cutting.</p>

<p>Though not greatly in vogue for golfing wear, plus-four knickers have
become very fashionable for skiing and winter sports wear as an alternative
to long ski-ing trousers. With plus-fours are worn knitted gaiters and
ski-ing boots. Pleats are inset in the tops, and an all-round waistband
allows for openings at both sideseams. The bottoms are pleated into a narrow
band cut to fit the small of the leg and fastening with a patent fastener as
used for men's plus-fours.</p>

either pleated or gathered in to a band of the same material or to a band of
knitwear which will stretch as the wearer's foot is inserted.</p>
<p>These garments fasten just above the ankle and, if they are cut to the

<h3>RIDING BREECHES</h3>
<h3 class="clear"><em><a href="illust/210.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,326);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/210-t.jpg" alt="Figure 210" width="102" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig210" id="fig210"></a>Fig. 210</h3>
<p>In drafting riding breeches, we have firstly to take into consideration
the natural position of the rider on the horse and, subsequently, provision
for the change of posture in the draft. The natural position of the rider is
equivalent to a stooping position when considered in comparison with the
normal standing figure, and consequently an increase of length in the back
balance and a reduction of length at the front are indicated. The back
balance increase is obtained by means of an adjustment of the seat angle to
give an increased amount of length and infused contour shape when the seat
seams are sewn together. The lowering of the front balance in proportion is
simply effected by a reduction of the front rise length at the centre.</p>
<p>The second factor to consider is the fitting of the shape of the leg from
the knee to the small and calf and, supplementary to this, the question of
seam placement. In the older styles of riding breeches emphasis was placed on
the  necessity for easing the topsides to the undersides over the knee to
give the required length for the bending of the knee. These days, however,
the run of the leg seam over towards the centre front of the leg gives an
extra quantity of length over the knee which cannot be obtained with the old
style of seam placement at the sides. In addition, a valuable bias seam is
obtained by the new seam placement, which contributes greatly to the success
of the knee fitting.</p>
<p>Fig. 210 shows the standard riding breeches draft with a centre knee
fastening and a side plaquet. The breeches extend to below the calf in
length, and are cut to give freedom in wear with a reasonable fitting
appearance at the seat seam.</p>
<p>Measurements for the draft are as follows&#8212;</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>Waist = 26 inches.</li>
	<li>Hips = 37 inches.</li>
	<li>Body-rise height = 12 inches.</li>
	<li>Full sideseam length from the waist to the heel = 41 inches.</li>
	<li>Leg length, calculated by subtracting the body-rise height from the
sideseam length = 29 inches.</li>
	</ul>
<p>The following measures are taken over the leg in a bending
position&#8212;</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>Tight knee width =13 inches.</li>
	<li>Tight small width, 2&frac12; inches below the knee = 11&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>Tight calf measure, 3&frac14; inches below the small = 13&frac12; inches.</li>
	</ul>
<p>If the breeches are required to be longer in length than to the calf, an
additional measure must be taken&#8212;the bottom size = 11 inches</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>Working scale = half the hip measure = 18&frac12; inches.</li>
	</ul>
<p>To draft&#8212;</p>
<p>Square from X.</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>1 from X = the body-rise height plus a seam = 12&frac14; inches.</li>
	<li>Square out from this point.</li>
	<li>2 from X = one-sixth of the scale.</li>
	<li>3 from X = one-fourth of the seat measure = 9&frac14; inches.</li>
	<li>4 from 3 = 1&frac12; inches for the spring at the sides of the breeches.</li>
	<li>5 from 1 = one-fourth of the waist measure plus 1&frac12; inches, of which
&frac12; inch is for two seams and 1 inch for a dart.</li>
	<li>6 from 5 = one-sixth of the scale.</li>
	<li>7 from 6 = &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>8 from 6 = &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>Square down from 6 to 9 5&frac12; inches and shape out the dart from 7 and
	  8
to 9 as indicated.</li>
	<li>10 from 1 = &frac34; inch. Shape the waist seam run from 5, 7 and 8 to
10.</li>
	<li>11 from X = &frac34; inch. Join 11 to point 1.</li>
	<li>12 from X = one-sixth of the scale plus &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>Shape the fork run from 12 to 10.</li>
	<li>13 from 2 = &frac34; inch.</li>
	</ul>
<p>This quantity decides the extent of the openness of the legs of the
breeches. The riding position requires a greater length of inside leg seam
than that taken in a direct vertical line as for trousers, and the variation
of the centre line from the usual location provides for a greater distance
from the knee to the fork and allies the balance of the legs of the breeches
with the actual position of the legs when astride the horse.</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>14 squared down from 13 equals 1 inch to 1&frac12; inches. This quantity
	  is
allowed as an addition to the actual length from the fork to the knee to
provide for the increased leg length required between these two points when
the leg is bent in the riding position.</li>
	<li>15 from 14 = the knee position, calculated as half the total leg length
less 2 inches.</li>
	<li>16 from 15 = 2&frac12; inches down from 15 for the position of the small
	  of
the leg.</li>
	<li>17 from 16 = 3 to 3&frac12; inches for the position of the calf.</li>
	<li>18 from 14 = the full breeches length and the position of the bottom of
the breeches.</li>
	<li>Square out from points 15, 16 and 17, 18.</li>
	<li>19 from 15 = one-fourth of the knee measure = 3&frac14; inches.</li>
	<li>Square down from 19 to 20, 21 and 22 on the lines squared out from 15,
16, 17 and 18.</li>
	<li>23 from 19 = one-half of the tight knee width = 6&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>24 from 20 = one-half of the tight small width = 5&frac34; inches.</li>
	<li>25 from 21 = half the tight calf measure = 6&frac34; inches.</li>
	<li>26 from 22 = half the bottom measure = 5&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>Shape the inside leg seam from 12 to 23, 24, 25, and 26, adding a slight
quantity of round to the seam between points 12 and 23 just above the
position of the knee.</li>
	</ul>
<p>The fastening of the breeches is placed down the actual centre of the shin
bone. Therefore, to ensure that the button-holes or lace-holes are in exactly
the centre, an addition must be made for the button edge from 15 to A.</p>
<p>For laced or buttoned breeches the quantity allowed is &frac12; to &frac34; inch.</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>A from 15 = &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>Square down from A to B, C and D on the lines squared out from 16, 17,
and 18.</li>
	<li>27 from A = 1&frac12; to 2 inches, depending on the style of the breeches
and whether they are required to be tightly fitting above the knee and then
balloon out sharply at the sides.</li>
	<li>Join 4 to 27.</li>
	<li>28 is half the distance from 4 to 27.</li>
	<li>Square out from 28 to 29 2 &frac12; to 3 inches according to the shape
desired.</li>
	<li>Shape the sideseam from 5 to 4 and from 4 to 29 and 27 to A, B, C and D
at the bottom edge.</li>
	<li>E from A = &frac34; inch, the point where the gore seam terminates at the
sideseam.</li>
	<li>Measure round from E to 30 on the sideseam a distance of 4 inches for
the knee balance point.</li>
	</ul>
<p>This completes the drafting of the topsides.</p>
<h5>THE UNDERSIDES</h5>
<p>To draft the undersides, cut round the topsides and, taking a new sheet of
pattern paper, lay the topsides in position and continue by locating the
seat-angle point 31.</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>31 from X = one-fourth of the waist measure plus 1 inch.</li>
	</ul>
<p>The location of the seat angle for breeches is governed by the necessity
for allowing for a general stooping position in contradistinction to the
normal walking attitude and, consequently, an increase of length over the
seat from the waist to the knee is required.</p>
<p>By raising point 31, the diagonal length from this point to the knee is
increased and, in addition, extra width is provided horizontally over the
seat from sideseam to sideseam.</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>32 from 12 = &frac34; inch.</li>
	</ul>
<p>The location of this point is changed in relation to its position for
trousers or walking garments, and the effect of the readjustment will be to
give a more &quot;crooked&quot; seat angle. This indicates an increased
length of seat seam when sewn together, equivalent to a smaller waist size
reducing a greater quantity in the back waist darts to give a greater length
and contour shape of material over the prominence of the seat.</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>Line through the seat angle from 32 to 31 and 33.</li>
	<li>Measure back from the seat-angle line at 33 to 34 one-fourth of the
waist measure plus 1&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>Square across from 34 to 33, by squaring with the seat-angle line.</li>
	<li>35 from 34 = one-sixth of the scale.</li>
	<li>36 from 35 = &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>37 from 35 = &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>M from 35 = 5&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>Shape out the back waist dart from 36 and 37 to M, making the length of
the dart seams from 36 to M and 37 to M equal for sewing-out purposes.</li>
	<li>By pivoting from 23, sweep from 12 to 38 the back fork quantity of 2&frac12;
inches.</li>
	<li>Shape the seat seam from 3/8 inch in front of 33 to 31 and 38, taking
care not to hollow the seam too greatly between points 31 and 38.</li>
	<li>39 from 4 = 2 inches for sideseam spring.</li>
	<li>Measure from A to 23 and then apply from 23 to 40 half the knee width
plus 1 inch for seams less the distance from A to 23.</li>
	</ul>
<p>Square down from 40 to 41, 42 and 43, which automatically locates the
correct widths of small, calf and bottom measures, since the location of
points 24, 25 and 26 are each exactly one-half of their respective leg-width
measures, as is also the location of point 23 at the knee. Therefore,
measuring up the knee width locates the proportionate widths of the small,
calf and bottom edge.</p>
<p>Add &frac12; inch below 43 and 26 on the back for two seams which are consumed
when the knee gore sews to the undersides of the breeches.</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>44 from 40 = the distance from A to E for the position of the gore seam
at the sideseams.</li>
	<li>45 from 20 = 1&frac14; inches, the position of the gore seam at the actual
side of the leg seam.</li>
	<li>46 from 24 = &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>Shape the under-gore seam from 44 to 45 and 46 as shown, touching the
small construction line at 16.</li>
	<li>By pivoting from 45, sweep from 44 to 47, which makes the gore seams
from 46 to 45 and 44 equal to the gore seam from 46 to 45 and 47.</li>
	<li>Point 47 is definitely located by measuring round the sideseam on the
topsides from 4 to 29, 30 and to E, the position of the gore seam at the
sideseam.</li>
	<li>Apply this length down from 39 to 47 in a direct line as indicated less
&frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>48 from 47 = the distance from E to 30 less &frac12; inch for a very slight
amount of easing-in of the topsides to the undersides over the knee
prominence.</li>
	</ul>
<p>Add &frac12; inch of round to the seam between points 47 and 48, and &frac34; inch
of round between points 48 and 39. Then continue the shaping of the sideseam
from 39 to 34 at the waist line, hollowing slightly below the waist as
shown.</p>
<p>Shape the top of the gore from 47 to 45 and 46, hollowing from 1&frac14; to
  1&frac12; inches above 16.</p>
<p>A balance mark is placed in the sideseam at 39 to agree with a similar
mark at 4 on the topside side-seam, and these marks, as well as those at 30
and 48, should be accurately matched in making the breeches.</p>
<p>The knee tack is 1 inch below point 15,</p>
<p>This completes the standard draft of riding breeches.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a name="ride" id="ride"></a><em><a href="illust/211.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,403);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/211-t.jpg" alt="Figure 211" width="128" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig211" id="fig211"></a>Explanation of the Gore Overlap (Fig.
211)</h3>
<p>Fig 211 illustrates the three sections of the breeches draft in the
sewing-together position of the sideseams. The gore overlap at 44 to 47
becomes opened as point 44 becomes adjacent to 47 for the seaming out of the
gore cut. When the gore is sewn out, points 44 and 47 are allied with point E
on the topside knee, while at the bottom edge point 43 agrees with point D.
The &frac12; inch of round added to the underside sideseam from 47 to 48 follows
the hollow of     the seam over the knee between E and 30. This round seam
obviates creases in the back of the knees as indicated by the arrows from
sideseam to sideseam. The absence of this round when the sideseam is run down
the centre front of the knee causes these defects, and the only time this
round can be omitted is when the seam of the topsides runs down the actual
side of the leg. The further the seam from A to D in Fig. 210 is advanced
round the front of the knee, the greater will be the quantity of round to the
seam which is required to sew with the accompanying topside seam.</p>
<p>If the breeches have fly-fronts, the tack of the fly should commence about
&frac34; inch up from the termination of the seams at the fork.</p>
<p>The back and front waist darts are sewn out in the marks indicated;
otherwise, &frac14; inch seams are allowed through the draft.</p>
<p>There are several methods of finishing the tops, viz. by a waistband,
split-falls, cross-pockets and fly-fronts, of which split-falls are described
under a separate heading.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a name="jodhpur" id="jodhpur"></a><em><a href="illust/212.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,278);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/212-t.jpg" alt="Figure 212" width="100" height="232" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig212" id="fig212"></a>Jodhpur Riding Breeches (Fig. 212)</h3>
<p>The origin of jodhpur riding breeches, as their name indicates, comes from
India, and are the riding breeches used for everyday wear by the natives.
Jodhpurs have become very popular for riding as an alternative to breeches
and are also to be seen gracing the legs of flying women and other sporty
adventurers.</p>
<p>No doubt the informality of jodhpur breeches is a great point in their
favour, for the modern woman does not like to dress up too much for her
sports, preferring freedom more than slavish adherence to accepted and
standardized rules of dress.</p>
<p>Jodhpur breeches should not be cut too long in the leg for a good
appearance; it is usual to arrange the leg length to within 2 inches of the
heel. The legs have a small opening or vent at each seam to enable the wearer
to insert her boot without any strain. The vent may either fasten with a
zip-fastener or another method is to stretch a piece of wide elastic over the
vent from one side to the other and then to sew in a short length of
whalebone to keep the legs at the bottom edge free from creasing up in
wear.</p>
<p>Another method of recent origin is to have a buttoned fastening from the
small to the bottom edge, simulating a gaiter effect with the buttons
fastening down the centre of the shinbone. The corners of the seams should be
well rounded off from the centre front to the back.</p>
<p>There is very little change from the ordinary breeches system in the
drafting of jodhpur breeches, the variation being below the calf.</p>
<p>Measurements for the draft are as follows&#8212;</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>Waist = 26 inches.</li>

<p>The jodhpur breeches draft is now complete.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a name="gorevary" id="gorevary"></a><em><a href="illust/213.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,334);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/213-t.jpg" alt="Figure 213" width="105" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig213" id="fig213"></a>Analysis of the Gore and Variation
of Side-seam Placement (Fig. 213)</h3>
<p>Fig. 213 illustrates clearly the effects of diverting the sideseam of
breeches from the actual side to the centre of the shin-bone at the knee,
small and calf. As the breeches and jodhpur drafts indicate, the gore seams
are overlapped to provide for equal length of the under sideseam to agree
with the increased length of the top sideseam caused by its centre seam
placement. To understand thoroughly the meaning of this overlapping, it is
necessary to go back to the actual side position of the sideseam and then
analyse the effect of moving the sideseam to the front and the consequent
effect on the under sideseam.</p>
<p>Fig. 213 shows the drafting lines of three breeches styles with the
sideseam placed at the actual side, towards the half-front and at the centre
front.</p>
<p>The elongated dash lines from X to A, M and point 4 indicate the top
sideseam in the actual side position. M from the centre line is one-fourth of
the knee width. Square down from M to 4 at the bottom edge line. U from the
construction line joining M to 4 is one-half of the knee width. V from the
same line is half the small width.</p>
<p>W from the construction line is half the calf width. Y from the
construction line is half the bottom width.</p>
<p>Measure from U to N the full knee width plus 1 inch less the distance from
M to U. Square down from N to 2 for the automatic location of the small, calf
and bottom widths. The position of the gore seam when the sideseam of the
breeches is placed exactly at the side of the leg is at point 1, half the
distance from N to the small construction line. Point 3 is where the gore
seam sews to the topside sideseam. The gore seam ends at the inside leg seam
at point S, &frac12; inch above point V. Shape the gore seams from 1 to S,
hollowing 1&frac12; inches at the centre of the small as shown.</p>
<p>The pitch marks A and B are each respectively 4 inches and 3&frac12; inches
above 3 and 1.</p>
<p>With the sideseams placed exactly at the side of the leg, the two seams
from X to 3 and X1 to 1 are practically equal in length, and consequently the
gore seam does not require overlapping to provide length to agree with the
length of the top sideseam.</p>
<p>Now consider the front sideseam to be placed half towards the front of the
leg, as indicated by the small dash lines from O to 6 and upwards from O to C
and X. O from the centre line is 1&frac12; inches. Square down from O to 6. To
produce the undersides, measure from O to U and apply this quantity from U to
locate P, by measuring the full knee width plus 1 inch for seams. Square down
from P to 8 to locate automatically the small, calf and bottom widths. The
position of the gore seam becomes higher on the leg as the sideseam moves
round towards the front of the leg, and the sideseam position is located 1&frac12; inches back from the centre at 7, 1 inch below P. Correspondingly, point
5 is indicated on the front sideseam as the position of the gore seam.
Measure round the sideseam from 5 to C for the pitch.</p>
<p>Now if the sideseam length from X to C is marked down from X1 to D on the
underside seam, the distance from C to 5 less &frac12; inch must be added from D
to locate point 9 so as to make the top and under sideseams of equal length.
This indicates an overlapping of the gore seams to the extent indicated from
7 to 9. Measure round the gore seam from 7 to S and apply this distance round
the upper gore seam from S to locate 9 definitely.</p>
<p>In moving the sideseam to exactly the centre front of the shin, the length
from X to E and 10 will be greater than from X to A and 3. Draft the
underside of the breeches by measuring from U to T the full knee width plus 1
inch for seams, less the distance from U to R. Square down from T to 13 for
the small, calf and bottom widths. The gore seam will be at its highest point
on the leg when the seam runs down the centre of the shin, and is placed at
12, &frac12; inch below T. Similarly, 10 indicates the point where the gore seam
is sewn on to the topside of the breeches.</p>
<p>Measure round from 10 to E the distance of the balance point, 4 inches,
then measure down from X to E, and apply this quantity from X1 to F on the
under sideseam. Then apply the length from E to 10 from F to 14 less &frac12;
inch. Measure the under-gore seam from 12 to 1 and S, and apply this quantity
from S to 1 and 14 round the top gore seam to locate point 14 definitely. Add
&frac12; inch of round to the seam from 14 to F to fit into the hollow of the top
seam from E to 10. The greater hollow at the knee demands more round to the
adjacent seam of the undersides, and without this round seam it is impossible
to eliminate the creases from sideseam to sideseam it the back of the knee in
wear.</p>
<p>From this draft it will be readily understood that the movement of the
sideseam from side to front gives an increased length, which on a flat draft
must 36 compensated by an overlapping of other parts to insure the seam
lengths remaining equal. The farther the seam is placed from the side the
more the length of the sideseam is increased and the greater the quantity of
overlapping of the gore seams. The gore position, however, does not become
higher than the point indicated at 10, &frac12; inch below the knee balance line,
if the seam were placed inside the centre construction line.</p>

214)</h3>
<p>The split-fall bearer finish to the tops of breeches is an alternative to
the side opening or fly-front finishes. To make this bearer, it is necessary
to make a slight variation in the construction of the breeches draft.</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>Cut the breeches to the full sideseam length as illustrated by Fig. 214
(a), and then mark down 1&frac12; inches from 1 to 2 for the position of the
bearer height at the centre front.</li>
	<li>3 from 1 = 2&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>4 from 3 = 1 to 2.</li>
	<li>7 from 3 = 7 inches and 3&frac12; inches from the centre seam.</li>
	<li>5 from 3 = 2 inches for the level of the pocket mouth seam.</li>
	<li>Square from 5 to 6.</li>
	<li>9 from 6 = 2 inches.</li>
	<li>Make the pocket mouth opening from 8 to 9, 5&frac12; to 6 inches in
width.</li>
	</ul>
<p>Allow a facing along the pocket-mouth opening as shown by Fig. 214 (b),
and then cut the bearer as indicated by Fig. 214 (c), allowing 1&frac12; inches
below the pocket mouth for the inside facing. The bearer should be cut two
seams inside the line from 3 to 7 and 1 inch longer below 7. Allow 1 inch
beyond the centre front seam for the front button fastening, make the depth
of the bearer 5 inches in length, and shape from 7 to the centre front as in
Fig. 214 (d).</p>
<p>The inset welt is cut on the fold edge of the material and about 1 inch in
finished width.</p>
<p>Fig. 214 (e) illustrates the appearance of the breeches tops when
completed.</p>

  <h2>    <font

			face="Arial">Preface to Second Edition</font></h2>
  <p>IN presenting the revised second edition of LADIES' GARMENT CUTTING AND
    MAKING the object has been to bring up to date the technical diagrams and
    fashion styles in accordance with the changes of fashion and cutting methods
  since the original edition was compiled.</p>
  <p>While the great majority of the diagrams are as technically applicable to-day
    as when the work was originally published, certain garments of sports wear
    style are cut in a totally different manner from that in years gone by, owing
    in part to the increased style knowledge of the general public. For instance,
    the cut, style, and fit of ladies' trousers and shorts are very different
    from what they were five or six years ago, when these garments were a novelty
    rather than general wear, and the variation in cutting methods necessary
    to produce the desired modern effect is quite considerable.</p>
  <p>In all these and similar points this edition has been suitably modified,
    and the reader can be assured that, as far as cutting methods are concerned,
    the diagrams and technical matter represent the most modern methods based
    on practical trial and experience.</p>
  <p>On the fashion side new styles are included, and, as an example of the results
    achieved by the cutting systems described, a number of plates show made-up
    examples of sports wear styles which in themselves fully illustrate the high
    degree of fit and style obtainable. These plates, incidentally, are of garments
    cut to stock measurements, and not special models made up exclusively for
    photographic purposes only.</p>
  <p>An addition that will appeal to all students of garment cutting is the <a href="lgcm-24.html">chapter
    devoted to cutting for the wholesale trade</a>. It will be noted that these diagrams
    differ in some respects from similar drafts in the earlier chapters, which
    are designed and intended essentially for the measure trade. For in the wholesale
    trade there is more emphasis on fitting a large variety and number of figures
    than concentration on the perfect fitting of any one individual. These diagrams,
    however, will give a useful comparison and provide the reader with some new
    insight into the methods prevalent in the wholesale side of the trade.</p>
  <p>In conclusion, the reception given to the first edition by the tailoring
    trade was extremely gratifying to all concerned, and has given the confidence
    that the revised edition will again provide useful knowledge and experience
    to many ladies' tailors and cutters who are also keen students of new methods
    and ideas. Suffice it to say that the systems embodied are based on practical
    experience in everyday work and, as such, can be adapted with very little
    alteration to the varying style demands of all types of customers and localities.</p>
  <p>No cutting method can completely satisfy all the demands made on it, but
    from the reports received of the first edition it was apparent that LADIES'
    GARMENT CUTTING AND MAKING was successful in filling a long-felt need by
    providing for ladies' tailors and dressmakers a modern reliable basis system
    which had as its primary object the cutting and making of well-fitting 
    garments.</p>

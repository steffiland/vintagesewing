  </p>
<p>THERE are many different varieties of stitching used in the making of
garments of a tailored character, and it will be useful for the novice if
these are described in some detail. For instance, pad-stitching the lapels is
an operation the principles of which many dressmakers cannot understand, and
this is only one stitch of which knowledge is lacking. The stitches which
finish off the commencements of pleats or pocket openings are another mystery
to many workers; these stitches are known as the &quot;sprat's head&quot; or
&quot;arrowhead&quot; and the &quot;crow's foot.&quot;</p>
<p>As befits one of the most important decorative stitches and one which is a
hallmark of finish on a tailored garment, the &quot;sprat's head&quot; will
be described first.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a name="sprat" id="sprat"></a><em><a href="illust/331.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,606);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/331-t.jpg" alt="Figure 331" width="140" height="143" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig331" id="fig331"></a>The Sprat's Head Stitch (Fig. 331)</h3>
<p>To make a sprat's head stitch, mark a triangle with chalk to the size
required and then begin the stitch at the lower left-hand corner. Take the
thread to the top corner and insert the needle from right to left in the
material and then back to the lower right-hand corner, inserting the needle
from right to left and bringing the stitch underneath the material to come to
the outside in front of the commencement at the left corner inside the
triangle. Draw the thread through and then take the needle to the top corner
and insert from right to left below the previous stitch. Take back to the
right bottom corner and insert the needle from right to left to come to the
surface on the inside of the triangle at the left bottom corner. Repeat the
above instructions until all the space inside the triangle is completely
covered.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a name="crow" id="crow"></a><em><a href="illust/332.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,654);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/332-t.jpg" alt="Figure 332" width="211" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig332" id="fig332"></a>The Crow's Foot Tack (Fig. 332)</h3>
<p>As a contrast to the sprat's head stitch, the crow's foot tack may be
utilized. This tack resembles the sprat's head in shape, but the overlapping
of the stitches is different and more complicated.</p>
<p>Firstly, mark the shape of the tack as illustrated by Fig. 332 and then
commence from the left corner. Take the silk through the top corner from
right to left and then diagonally down to the right corner and continue the
stitch through in an upward direction. From the right corner take the silk to
the left corner and insert the needle above the previous stitch in a downward
direction from the left side of the triangle to the bottom side. Next take
the silk to the top corner and insert the needle from right to left, and then
insert it in the bottom side at the right lower corner to come out on the
right side of the triangle. Continue by taking the silk over to the left side
of the triangle and insert the needle in a downward direction to come out on
the bottom side of the triangle, and continue to the top corner as described
until the complete tack is formed.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a name="bar" id="bar"></a><em><a href="illust/333.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',526,792);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/333-t.jpg" alt="Figure 333" width="153" height="91" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig333" id="fig333"></a>The Bar-tack (Fig. 333)</h3>
<p>The bar-tack is used to a great extent in the making of trousers and
breeches. This tack may be employed for the plaquet opening on skirts, the
pocket openings on trousers, and the cuff openings of sleeves.</p>
<p>To make the tack, with a single cord of silk take three long stitches to
the length of tack required. Then work the barring stitch over the long
stitches from side to side as illustrated by the diagram.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a name="cross" id="cross"></a><em><a href="illust/334.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',545,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/334-t.jpg" alt="Figure 334" width="152" height="95" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig334" id="fig334"></a>Cross-stitching a Hem (Fig. 334)</h3>
<p>For catching down the hems of dresses, skirts, trousers turn-ups and
almost every type of seam which needs neatening, the cross-stitch is
indispensable.</p>
<p>Fig. 334 shows the working of this stitch. The edge of the seam to be
cross-stitched is held away from the hand with the edge of the garment
towards the worker, and the needle is inserted into the hem or turn-up at the
left side. The silk is then taken to the right and the needle inserted from
right to left in the material to come out on the left side. Continue by
crossing the silk over towards the right in advance of the lower stitch and
insert the needle from right to left as before. Similarly, in the upper row
cross the silk forward towards the right and insert the needle from right to
left. The needle is always inserted towards the commencement of the stitch,
while the silk is always taken forwards away from the start.</p>
<p>Always endeavour to keep an even distance between the insertions of the
needle, so that the slant of the cross-over stitches may be equal
throughout.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a name="pad" id="pad"></a><em><a href="illust/335.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,313);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/335-t.jpg" alt="Figure 335" width="100" height="194" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig335" id="fig335"></a>Pad-stitching Lapels (Fig. 335)</h3>
<p>Pad-stitching is an essential part of tailoring a coat, and in the
absolute sense should form a perfect series of &quot;V&quot; stitches when
completed. The right lapel is always commenced from the top of the crease
line and the left from the bottom, so that width of canvas is worked equally
over the lapel by the pad-stitching.</p>
<p>Insert the needle and silk from right to left, making sure not to take the
stitch untidily through the material on the underneath. Continue to work down
the lapel by stitches as above and, when at the end of the crease line, work
back by inserting the point of the needle into the hole of the previous
stitch and draw the silk through from right to left. Similarly, connect up
the stitches in rows of &quot;V&quot; lines to extend to the edge of the
lapel. In practice, these stitches do not often form perfect &quot;V&quot;
marks as the tune spent on padding the lapel would be too long, and so it is
necessary to spread the stitches out more.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a name="french" id="french"></a><em><a href="illust/336.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,717);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/336-t.jpg" alt="Figure 336" width="140" height="120" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig336" id="fig336"></a>Making a French Seam (Fig. 336)</h3>
<p>For unlined coats and dress seams, make a French seam. Allow &frac12; inch for
the seam when cutting from the material, and then lay the two wrong sides of
the cloth together and machine down the edges a &frac14;-inch seam inside. Trim
the edge and turn back to let the right sides of the material lie together
and then machine down again, taking care to machine outside the first seam so
that only a single seam of stitching is shown when finished.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a name="lapped" id="lapped"></a><em><a href="illust/331.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,606);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/331-t.jpg" alt="Figure 331" width="140" height="143" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig337" id="fig337"></a>The Lapped Seam (Fig. 337)</h3>
<p>Another method of making a neat finish to the sideseams of unlined coats
is the lapped seam, in which one side of the seam is turned in over the other
and neatly felled down. When cutting from the material, allow a &frac14;-inch seam
on one side and about 1 inch on the other, and then seam with &frac34; inch
allowed on the outside edge for the turning-in. Turn in the edge of the inlay
&frac14; inch, then fold over the edge of the narrow seam and fell down closely to
the machine stitching.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a name="bound" id="bound"></a><em><a href="illust/338.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,570);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/338-t.jpg" alt="Figure 338" width="183" height="188" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig338" id="fig338"></a>Bound Button-holes (Fig. 338)</h3>
<p>Bound button-holes should always be made before the facings of the coat
are sewn on, and then the button-holes can be catch-stitched round to the
canvas.</p>
<p>Mark the button-hole length on the fronts of the coat and tack round to
keep the parts together, as in Fig. 338 (a). Cut the facing for the
button-hole on the bias of the material for ease in turning out and tack over
the button-hole line. Make a chalk line on the bias material immediately over
the original button-hole line and then machine round as illustrated by Fig.
338 (b). Keep the machine lines about &frac14; inch apart so that the jeattings of
the button-hole finish very closely. Cut down the centre of the chalk mark
and notch into each corner to the machine stitching, as shown by Fig. 338
(c).</p>
<p>Pull the bias material through into the inside of the coat and press open
the edge seams (Fig. 338 (d)). Pleat over the corners of the facing and baste
round preliminary to catch-stitching round the edges (Fig. 338 (e)).
Catch-stitch round the edges of the facing, and then, after the coat facing
has been sewn on, slit through and turn in the edges of the facing for
felling down round the button-hole, as shown by Fig. 338 (f) and (g).</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a name="bias" id="bias"></a><em><a href="illust/339.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,731);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/339-t.jpg" alt="Figure 339" width="237" height="194" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig339" id="fig339"></a>Bias Bindings (Fig. 339)</h3>
<p>Bias bands should be cut on the exact bias, otherwise a twisted band will
result in the finished work. To cut the band, commence by levelling up the
material edge by tearing across or cutting in a drawn thread mark, and then
fold the end of the material towards the selvedge to form a diagonal fold
edge which is the true bias. The bias bands should be cut on this fold edge,
marked off to the width required, and follow the fold edge accurately.</p>
<p>When seaming bias bands for increased length, cut diagonally across the
end of the bands and machine together on the straight of the material. The
diagram shows the right way to machine bias bands, with the grain of each
band agreeing. With diagonal stripes, match the bias bands so that the
pattern runs the same way when machined together.</p>
<p>Bias bands shape themselves to curves if they are not too acute, but care
should be taken to ensure that the seam of the material bound is notched to
prevent twisting.</p>
<p>Bindings are cut to varying widths, depending on the material required to
be bound. For velvets, a single-width band cut to four times the finished
binding width is required. For thin materials, such as silks and transparent
fabrics, a double band cut on the fold edge should be used so that less
difficulty will be experienced in turning back and hemming down to a regular
width.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a name="button" id="button"></a><em><a href="illust/340.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,729);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/340-t.jpg" alt="Figure 340" width="207" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig340" id="fig340"></a>The Button-hole Stitch (Fig. 340)</h3>
<p>The button-hole stitch is one of the most important and difficult of all
tailoring stitches and has a distinct influence on the finished appearance of
the garment.</p>
<p>Mark a line for the button-hole with chalk and then cut in the line to the
required length. If the hole has an eye, it is necessary to cut this out
carefully. Serge round the button-hole to keep the edges from fraying out.</p>
<p>The next step is the barring, which consists of carrying the barring
thread or gimp round the hole at a distance from the edge in accordance with
the width of the button-hole stitches. To commence, place the left side of
the hole between the thumb and finger with the eye away from the hand, press
the needle through the hole opening to the underside and then insert through
the material to the outside. Before pulling the needle clear of the material,
cast the button-hole silk round the needle as illustrated by the diagram.
Completely draw out the needle and pull the stitch close to the edge of the
hole. Continue making each stitch in a similar manner until the hole is
completed.</p>
<p>When button-holing is being carried out round the eye, the stitches must
be made very thickly and the purl of each stitch pulled well up. When the end
of the button-hole opening is reached, the two sides of the hole should be
brought together by the last stitch; then the needle is passed twice through
the material, and a bar may be formed by loop stitches made across the end of
the hole.</p>
<p>Button-hole making needs much practice before proficiency can be reached,
and a point to note is that the stitches should be drawn slightly forward and
pulled into place with exactly the same tension for each purl. In lieu of
gimp, four-cord thread, well waxed, will serve for the barring thread.</p>

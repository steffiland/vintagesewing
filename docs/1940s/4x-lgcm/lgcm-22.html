<p>MANY dressmakers prefer to cut their patterns by modelling in muslin or
toile direct on to a stand or the actual figure. In the hands of practised
modellers, modelling patterns becomes as accurate and simple as drafting on
the flat, but, generally speaking, modelling is an art which needs a lot of
study and accurate and patient work. The great French dressmakers, almost
without exception, model their creations either on stands or the actual
figure and spend much time and material before the garment is satisfactory.
In comparison with scientific cutting, modelling is a laborious job, but the
knowledge of how to model will materially assist the pattern cutter in her
job, for she will know how the systematic drafts are derived from modelling
practice.</p>
<p>There is more than one method of modelling or draping muslin to the stand
or the figure. One way is to build up the design gradually on the stand by
cutting and draping each section of the design piece by piece. This method
involves much more waste of time and material than the second method
described below, for the fitting of the stand and designing cannot be
systematically carried out in sections without the balance of the various
sections becoming disturbed. This method also means constant reshaping and
recutting, as it is practically impossible to cut the exact line required
without comparison with the other sections of the design as a whole.</p>
<p>The most practical of all modelling methods is that of fitting the exact
outline of the stand or figure with a muslin &quot;shell,&quot; care being
taken to obtain a perfectly fitting model by the unrestrained use of panel
seams and darts. While this perfectly cut shape is on the stand, the lines of
the design are marked in with chalk and then transmitted from the shaped
model on to a flat plane by the outline of the design being traced from the
modelled shape. Therefore, when the re-marked pattern is sewn together, the
garment should be identical with the original model with the same waist
suppression fitting as in the original, but obtained without the panel
seams.</p>
<p>For very cut-about designs, this method of modelling is to be preferred to
flat pattern cutting, as the waist suppression can be infused into the muslin
shape and subsequently into the traced-off pattern outline with a certainty
of the accurate original outline being retained. The typical Parisian dress
or coat is usually distinguished by extremely varied design with many pieces,
and it is often impossible to infuse directly by straight cutting the
required amount of waist suppression into the coat as the design lines may be
so intricate as to give no possible position or run of seam to accommodate
the suppression quantities. By modelling a shape to the size of garment
required, we are making sure of the suppression and fitting before attempting
the designing, which is the correct procedure, for the fitting qualities of
any garment should be considered before points of design.</p>
<p>It has been the experience of the author to observe cutters shirking the
issue of waist suppression and fit when faced by a very cut-about design.
They usually content themselves with attempting to reduce a large quantity of
the waist suppression from the sideseams, leaving the back and front waist to
take care of themselves. The question of waist suppression is a strong point
with the author, and he firmly believes that insufficient attention is paid
to this important point simply because the majority of cutters are shy of
deviating from their established ideas.</p>
<p>To obtain the outline shape it is necessary to be armed with plenty of
pins and muslin. The French method is to make a model of one side of the
figure and design only, that is, of course, if the design is an even one and
not two-sided. In the event of an uneven design it is advisable to make a
complete model of both sides of the shape.</p>
<p>For a dress model shape, firstly mark on the stand the exact centre line
of the back and front from the neck to the end of the stand. Then take a
suitable piece of muslin, long enough to take the full length of the dress
and wide enough to pass round the figure shape to the sideseam position under
the arms. Mark the height of the collar seam at the back neck and then
commence to pin the muslin to the centre back line, allowing about 1&frac12;
inches above the back neck line for adjustment of the neck height.</p>
<p>Pin the muslin down the centre back line from the neck to the required
length. After this has been done, smooth the muslin out over the hips to the
sideseam, and then pin at the sideseam from the breast level down into the
waist hollow and over the hip curve to the hem, making sure that the muslin
lies smooth in and out of the side waist hollow without any tendency to
&quot;tie&quot; at the waist line and without any dragging from the blade
level or the hips.</p>
<p>It will now be observed that, if the hips are fitted closely, it will not
be possible to fit the breast level at the back to such a close degree. In
fact, a certain quantity of ease at the breast level must be left, otherwise
straining the muslin to fit the back at this point will result in the
sideseam being pulled away from the waist hollow, which indicates that, when
the waist is returned back to the waist hollow, a dragging crease will become
apparent from the blade level to the side waist. Summing up, it is apparent
that to fit the back perfectly at the breast-line level, it is not possible
to reduce the garment to size at the side-seams only, but instead a certain
quantity of the surplus size and material must be reduced under the
prominence of the blades.</p>
<p>The loose material in the back waist hollow is shaped to the figure after
the shoulders have been fitted and the scye shaped.</p>
<p>To shape the shoulders, smooth the muslin up round the neck to the point
where the shoulder seam is required, and then pin round the neck and mark a
sewing-edge run. Roughly trim the material to the shape of the back neck
curve, and then smooth down the shoulders and up over the blades to obtain
the location of the shoulder seam. Pin from the neck curve down in the
required shoulder seam position, and then gather in the shoulder length
slightly over the blade to keep the armhole from the shoulder end to the
breast line close to the figure and to provide shape for the prominence of
the blade. Measure the shoulder width and back width and roughly shape the
armhole from the scye level to the shoulder end, making the depth of the scye
from the neck level equal to one-third of the half-breast measure plus 1&frac12;
inches or 7&frac12; inches for a 36-inch bust girth.</p>
<p>Mark the breast line square across from the centre back to the scye level
and shape the scye. Then, at the sideseam, mark down from the breast line to
the bottom edge of the shape to define the sideseam at exactly under the
arm.</p>
<p>The back waist suppression is the next point. Carefully pin away the
surplus material in the back waist hollow and over the breast line to the
blade. On the standard model shape it will be found that about 1&frac34; inches will
be taken out in the suppression; but the point to note is that this
suppression is correctly reduced at this point, for if we tried to take in
the garment more at the sideseam, the result would be that the sideseams
would not lie smoothly in the hollow of the waist at the side. This
definitely means that suppression at the sideseams under the arms is correct
only to a small degree, and not to the extent sometimes seen, quantities from
1&frac12; to 2 inches being incorrectly reduced at this point.</p>
<p>The moulding of the back to the figure is now finished, and we can proceed
with the more accurate shaping of the back to the half-width measure and the
back of the armhole to the shoulder end.</p>
<p>The fronts are the next consideration. Commence by marking down the exact
centre of the stand a balance line to which to pin the muslin. Then with a
suitably large piece of muslin, pin down the centre front line from the base
of the neck to the length required. When this has been firmly completed,
commence to smooth the muslin up to the shoulder seam marked on the back
shape, making sure that the muslin is not dragged away from the fronts when
shaping round the neck curve. Roughly shape round the neck and pin across the
shoulder for about 2 inches.</p>
<p>Then smooth the muslin back over the round of the hips to the sideseam
line of the back shape and, taking care not to drag the muslin out of
balance, pin the sideseam from the hip level to the armhole level of the
back, making sure of having sufficient length at the sideseam for the
material to lie smoothly in the hollow of the waist. A certain amount of
surplus material will be left in the waist hollow under the bust prominence,
which cannot be reduced elsewhere than at this point. To endeavour to make
the reduction at the sideseam would cause the material to leave the waist and
set up dragging creases from the breast and hip prominence in front. So make
sure that the sideseam length is sufficient before troubling about waist
suppression.</p>
<p>Mark down the sideseam line immediately above the back sideseam line and
then continue with the shaping of the shoulders and the front of the scye. As
the material lies at present, without the shoulder pinned throughout, there
is a decided surplus at the front of the scye, causing a V fold of material
diagonally from the bust point to the front scye. To get rid of this fold it
is necessary to take out a wedge of material down from the shoulder to the
bust point to pull the surplus length away and upwards from the front of the
scye; in other words, the bust dart is taken out. When the surplus length has
been taken away, and the bust dart pinned down to the prominence, complete
the pinning of the front shoulder to the back, and then mark the shoulder
seam immediately above the back seam and correct the shoulder width to agree
with the back shoulder. Here it must be noted that the front shoulder is
smoothed cleanly into the hollow of the shoulder, while the back shoulder is
eased in slightly to make provision for the round contour of the blades.</p>
<p>Now measure back from the centre front point on the breast line, for the
front of scye or armhole position, one-fourth of the breast measure less 1&frac14; inches
for all sizes. Mark a line square upwards from this point, shape the front of
the armhole from the side-seam to &frac14; inch in advance of this
line, and terminate at the shoulder end to complete the model.</p>
<p>The purpose of making the model is to illustrate the correct location
of the waist suppressions and general balance points.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><a href="illust/341.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,299);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/341-t.jpg" alt="Figure 341" width="102" height="220" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig341" id="fig341"></a>Fig. 341</h3>
<p>Fig. 341 illustrates the modelled shape placed in the square. For the
purpose of simplicity, measurements are used to denote the various lengths in
their relationship.</p>
<p>It will be noted that the sideseams are reduced only &frac12; inch in quantity
at the back and front from the breast width, while a very large quantity is
reduced at the back waist in the panel. This suppression is carried well
above the breast line to the blade prominence. The sideseam at the back skirt
is rather straight in line, but the skirt width is usually increased in a
panelled garment by an addition to each panel seam. This is obtained when
cutting the modelled shape in one piece by cutting up the model from the hem
to the hip level and opening out the skirt width until the modelled shape can
be placed flat.</p>
<p>The fronts have a diagonal suppression dart ranging from the hip bone to
under the bust prominence and running on the &quot;corner&quot; of the body
at this section. Again note the straight run of the sideseams from the bust
to the waist, from the waist to the hips and from the hip level to the hem,
and also note the quantity taken from the front waist dart.</p>
<p>These outlines are not the result of mere system-making, but are the
actual shape of a perfectly modelled and fitting shell pattern and, as such,
have the convincing quality of being absolutely correct. With modelling, one
cannot rely on the efforts of the person making the garment in order to
obtain a good fit. The actual modelled shape must take the outline of the
figure naturally, and so the balance of each part must be perfect, otherwise
an adverse effect will be apparent elsewhere. In modelling, one cannot hope
to achieve success unless each section of the garment has this perfect
balance.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a name="panel" id="panel"></a><em><a href="illust/plate-05.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,587);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/plate-05-t.jpg" alt="Plat 5 - Modelling without Panel-Seam Waist Suppression" width="220" height="223" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="plate5" id="plate5"></a>Making a Model Without Panel
Suppression</h3>
<p>The previous description was concerned with the fundamental modelling
construction, and now we go on to more practical work in the making of a
model to fit the shape without panel-seam waist suppression. With this model,
there is a waist seam, and the suppression is modelled out direct without
recourse to panel-modelling and recutting.</p>
<p>The breast, waist and hip balance lines should be clearly indicated on the
stand in addition to the centre back and front vertical lines.</p>
<p>Take a suitable piece of material and commence at the centre back neck.
Allow about 1 inch above the nape of the neck for the back neck curve, and
then pin down the centre back from the nape of the neck to the natural waist
line. Make sure that the grain of the material is perfectly correct
vertically and horizontally. After pinning down the back, smooth the material
to the sideseam at the breast-line level and smooth over the blades to the
shoulder seam. Pin the shoulder and back neck covering material in place and
mark the run of the shoulder seam to the required angle. Measure round the
back neck one-sixth of the half-breast measurement less &frac14; inch and shape
from the nape of the neck to meet the shoulder seam. The shoulder seam should
be marked to the required width, about one-eighth of the breast measurement
plus &frac12; inch, and then the width of the back marked from midway of the nape
of the neck and the breast line to the armhole. Mark roughly the shape of the
armhole at the back, and then complete the modelling of the back bodice by
pinning down the sideseam from the breast line to the waist level. The
material should be carefully smoothed to the figure before pinning, and
afterwards the sideseam and the waist line marked in.</p>
<p>To model the back skirt section, take a piece of material of sufficient
length and pin down the centre back line to the hip level and the bottom of
the stand. Then carefully smooth the material towards the side-seam at the
waist and hips, making sure not to force too much width into the skirt by
distorting the balance of the material grain. The grain should run
horizontally in accordance with the marked balance lines on the stand until
at the side back &quot;corner&quot; of the figure where it is deflected in a
downward direction, as the back waist hollow requires more length to fit into
the sideseam. After pinning down the side-seam from the waist to the hip
level, mark the waist seam and the sideseam run vertically from the hip level
to the hem line. Additional width may be added at the sideseam away from the
stand when cutting out.</p>
<p>The back is now completely modelled, and the next consideration is the
front.</p>
<p>Commence by pinning from the neck to the breast and waist lines down
  the centre front, and then shape the material up to the shoulder seam round
  the
neck column. The material will require to be cut away as illustrated in Plate
5, and it is quite a good plan to cut out the neck shape and obtain the neck
point before commencing to model on the stand. For this purpose, mark a
straight line on the material or work from a straight edge, and then mark in
a quantity equal to one-twelfth of the breast measurement for the neck point.
A similar quantity should be marked downwards on the centre line, and then
the circular shape of the neck curve can be cut away before the material is
pinned down the centre front.</p>
<p>Assuming that the neck point has been found, the next operation is to
smooth the material into the hollow of the shoulder and down past the front
of the armhole to the sideseam. Pin the shoulder and mark the seam run
directly above the run of the back shoulder.</p>
<p>Pin the material at the top of the sideseam on the breast level, and
smooth the excess to the level of the bust prominence preparatory to reducing
in a dart from the sideseam.</p>
<p>Smooth the material over the breast to the waist line and then mould the
muslin from the centre front line to the sideseam at the waist level, making
sure to keep the grain of the material horizontal until the natural curving
round of the figure into the side waist causes a divergence downwards from
the horizontal. Mark the waist line, then pin the sideseam from the breast to
the waist line and reduce the excess material in the breast dart as
illustrated.</p>
<p>On the breast line, mark back from the centre front line one-fourth of the
breast measure less 1&frac14; inches for the position of the front of the
armhole. Mark a line squarely up from this point, and shape the arm-hole from
the sideseam to the shoulder end, advancing &frac14; inch in front of the scye
line.</p>
<p>The skirt is modelled in a similar manner to the back, i.e. by pinning
down the centre front line and then smoothing the material to the sideseams
and into the waist hollow, care being taken to keep the grain level as far as
possible. Mark in the sideseam to match the back sideseam, and mark the skirt
run below the hip level to allow for sufficient stride room in the hem. An
average width of the hem is approximately 4 to 6 inches more than the hip
measurement for a straight skirt.</p>
<p>The model is now completed and we can examine the outline on the flat by
referring to Fig. 342.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><a href="illust/342.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,288);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/342-t.jpg" alt="Figure 342" width="100" height="224" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig342" id="fig342"></a>Fig. 342</h3>
<p>The first point which strikes the eye is the displacement of the breast
and waist balance lines from the horizontal and the lower shoulder slope on
the back shoulder. This is caused by the closing out of the waist suppression
at the side back to obtain the shape in one piece, and is exactly as
described in the chapter on <a href="lgcm-04.html">Waist Suppression</a>. The actual size of the
back-scye is the same as that of Fig. 341, so the shoulder slope is unchanged
in principle.</p>
<p>In the back skirt there is an increase of width at the hem and a curvature
of the waist and hip balance lines to the extent of approximately &frac34; inch
from the horizontal.</p>
<p>At the fronts, we have a raised breast line to keep the front of the
armhole the same diameter as the draft showing a breast dart from the
shoulder, for, in this instance, the front shoulder slope is rather higher
than the previous example. The waist balance line is curved to the extent of
&frac34; inch, and a large dart equal to 2 inches is reduced at the sideseam to
control the material forced down from the front of the scye and round from
the waist hollow.</p>
<p>On the front skirt section there is a curvature of the waist and hip
balance lines to the extent of &frac34; inch, and the hem width is increased in
proportion. This increase of hem width is caused by the closing out of the
waist suppression as illustrated in the chapter on <a href="lgcm-04.html">Waist
Suppression</a>.</p>
<p>As further examples of modelled patterns, a modelled &quot;lounge&quot;
shape and a sidebody jacket shape are illustrated and described. The &quot;lounge&quot; shape
has one sideseam only placed towards the back of the coat as in a man's lounge
jacket. This style is generally admitted to be difficult
to cut satisfactorily, and the modelled pattern will show how the method of
drafting this style is correct in principle.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a name="lounge" id="lounge"></a><em><a href="illust/343.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,443);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/343-t.jpg" alt="Figure 343" width="141" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig343" id="fig343"></a>The Modelled &quot;Lounge&quot;
Outline (Fig. 343)</h3>
<p>Fig. 343 illustrates an exact outline of the modelled &quot;lounge&quot;
pattern placed in the square. Although the model was pinned vertically down
the centre front line as usual, the breast line showed a distinct break in an
upward direction from the underarm dart towards the back sideseam. The dash
line at the breast level illustrates the continuation of the breast line
after being diverted, and to indicate the similarity between this modelled
pattern and the author's standard draft, the pattern has been placed with the
breast line of the back running in line with the diverted breast line at the
sideseam to the underarm dart. This indicates that the breast line from the
underarm to the fronts is raised or, as the author has systematized the
principle, the hip overlap has been inserted at the underarm seam.</p>
<p>A large suppression has been taken out at the side-seam equal to 1&frac34;
inches, and 1&frac14; inches have been reduced from the underarm dart. Many
cutters may look askance at these suppressions, but the truth remains that if
a garment is required to fit into the waist, these quantities must be taken
out; otherwise how can the waist size be reduced to the figure? The author
believes in cutting to an extreme generally; it is easier to allow for ease
when the system provides a perfectly balanced garment to an extreme degree of
fitting. It is only when we have a system giving a well-balanced garment to a
looser degree of fit and then attempt to obtain a closer fit that we meet
trouble. For it must be understood that if a garment is well balanced in the
closest degree of fitting quality, a slight easiness of fit will not affect
the balance, whereas a well-balanced cardigan coat pattern would be far from
balanced if made close to the waist measure.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a name="outline" id="outline"></a><em><a href="illust/344.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,475);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/344-t.jpg" alt="Figure 344" width="152" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig344" id="fig344"></a>Modelled Outline of a Sidebody Jacket
(Fig. 344)</h3>
<p>Fig. 344 illustrates the modelled outline of a side-body jacket. Here,
also, the similarity between the author's system draft and this model is
apparent. Again we see a straight sideseam suppressed only &frac12; inch at the
waist on both seams. The back waist suppression is well shaped to the figure
as indicated by the hollow run of the back sidebody seam from the scye to the
waist. A point to remember is not to hollow out the back scye too much at the
point indicated by A; otherwise, when the sideseam and sidebody seams are
sewn out, there will be too much of a hollow run at this point and a fullness
will be seen at the top of the sideseam.</p>
<p>Marking the design on the modelled outline should be performed on the
stand so that the correct perspective and balance between the design lines
are obtained. If the first example of modelling is used for the basic
pattern, the suppressions pinned out at the back and front waist should be
manipulated as described in the dress-cutting systems in order that the
modelled pattern may be placed flat on the pattern paper. On the back bodice,
the model should be cut through from the shoulder seam to the blade at the
point where the suppression ends, and the skirt should be cut through from
the hem line to the hip level to obtain extra skirt width and enable the
model to be laid out flat.</p>
<p>The front bodice may have a shoulder dart or a sideseam bust dart. If the
waist dart is not required, cut through the shoulder dart to the bust point
and re-mark the pattern with the waist dart closed out of the model. If a
sideseam dart is used, cut through from the sideseam to the breast
prominence, lay the model out flat on the paper and re-mark with both
shoulder and waist darts eliminated. The skirt should be manipulated in a
similar manner to the back, i.e. by cutting through from the hem line and
opening out the skirt width until the model lies flat on the paper.</p>
<p>If a very close skirt is needed and panel seams are shown in the design,
the skirt width as modelled will be ample and the waist suppressions are
reduced from the panel seams.</p>
<p>If a knowledge of practical pattern making is possessed, it is only
necessary to obtain the exact modelled outline from the stand or figure.
Every other cutting operation, such as the addition of flares or pleats, may
be made away from the stand by flat cutting. To model a dress completely on
the stand is a waste of time, for, apart from the actual modelling to the
figure, every other operation can be more easily done on the flat.</p>

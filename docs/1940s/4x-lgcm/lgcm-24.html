<p>UNDOUBTEDLY the future of the garment trade as a career for men and women
lies in the wholesale side of the business. For here the opportunities are as
many and varied as the different branches of the trade allow. In comparison
with the retail trade, scope for advancement is relatively more commensurate
with individual ability, providing opportunities for graduation from a stock
cutter's position to either foreman or forelady over a cutting-room and
eventually to designer or designer-cutter's office. Here one has undisputed
sway over the entire production of the establishment, ranging from the actual
designing to pattern-cutting and production of first samples and repeat
orders in bulk.</p>
<p>Whilst the work is less individual in comparison with the retail measure
trade with its personal contacts in the fitting room, this lack of personal
contact has its compensations, for the worker, being tree from the average
customer's fads and foibles, can concentrate more successfully on the
production of as perfect a garment as possible to a desired standard of
fitting quality. It is the aim and the test of the wholesale designer to
produce garments that will give a fair to good fit on the greatest number of
persons of a similar bust size. On whether he can achieve this result or not
depends the success or otherwise of the establishment with which he is
associated, and also his own success. That there must be a certain amount of
alteration when the garments are tried on individual customers in the shops
is admitted, but, on the other hand, the balance of the garments must be such
that these alterations remain minor in character; for example, shortening the
sleeves, shortening the length of the coat or similar garment to the
customer's own ideas, or moving buttons.</p>
<p>The author has had the personal experience of trying on stock garments
made by reputable wholesalers on average figures and finding them to be
completely out of balance&#8212;too long in the front balance from neck to
bust, resulting in the garment falling away from the figure at the front, or
too deep in the armhole, necessitating a major alteration by lifting the
shoulders and bringing the garment up into its correct position on the
wearer. This particular alteration is far from simple, for as the shoulders
are lifted the armhole becomes smaller in circumference, the collar too long,
and the sleeve head too large to go back into the smaller armhole. So it
cannot be emphasized too strongly that the fit and balance of garments in the
wholesale trade must be as perfect as is humanly possible before they are
passed and repeated in bulk orders.</p>
<p> The chief fault lies with the wholesale pattern cutter having failed to
test out his pattern on a number of different figures before going into
production. Too often it is the case that designers work on a stand or dummy
figure, a practice which, while being an excellent idea in its way and very
adaptable to the cutting of special effects or trying out of different seam
placements that cannot accurately be visualized on a flat draft, cannot bear
any comparative resemblance to an. actual human figure.</p>
<p> The wholesale cutter must test out his patterns on. living models, as
many of the same or similar bust size as possible, and then cut coats for
each figure,, using the same basic pattern in each instance. He must fit
these garments and then note in a tabulated form the various alterations from
the basic pattern necessary to find the average outline for each and every
figure. These alterations should be transferred to the basic pattern and then
an average taken which will give the pattern outline most suitable to fit the
greatest number of varying figures of equal bust measurement.</p>
<p> Every firm has its own ideas of style, which should be set by the
designer to form almost a trade mark so that buyers will be able to recognize
that each wholesale house can be relied upon to provide their style
requirements. In other words, wholesale houses should specialize and create
an individual style, so that a model has only to wear a sample for the buyer
to recognize the house of origin.</p>
<p>The basic outlines of fit, degree of ease, or closeness should vary only
with changing seasonal fashion. It must be possible for a designer to produce
garments to many different styles which are identical in fit and balance. It
has been the author's own experience to cut many samples from the same
pattern and yet find, on having them made up, that the fit in each instance
was completely different. This may be due to a number of causes, namely,
different texture of material, the human element in making-up, or errors in
cutting out. But it only serves to point the fact that designers must be
constantly on the alert whilst making samples in order to study the
requirements of each design.</p>
<p>There is very little time or money in the wholesale trade for altering or
adjusting patterns, for samples have to be cut, made up, and passed by the
principals as quickly as possible so as to enable travellers' samples to be
put in hand, costings made up, pattern ranges got out, publicity arranged and
all the myriad details of making a collection attended to. Therefore it is
wasting time, cloth and money to use a pattern of which one is not sure of
the result. Far better to test out thoroughly beforehand in any old piece of
muslin, canvas or odd cloth to ensure the reliability or otherwise of the
base pattern.</p>
<p>It is the purpose of this work to present tested patterns on a systematic
basis so that cutters will be able to produce a corresponding result not only
in their sample sizes, but throughout an entire size range. The degree of fit
is close as befits modern style in garment cutting, but adjustments for
degrees of ease or closeness will be illustrated by practical examples.</p>
<p>The basis of the system is contrary to the accepted practice of the
majority of designer-cutters. As a general rule cutters in drafting out their
patterns use the bust measurement as a basis of construction, but the
author's system is based on the chest measurement, taken on the level above
the bust. The logical explanation of this is simple, for the chest
measurement is a true measurement of the frame of the body, whilst the bust
measurement is a measure of what is technically a disproportionate growth on
the body. By this is meant that the bust measurement may vary in relation to
the chest measurement when the latter remains constant. For example, a chest
measure of 34 inches may have a corresponding bust measurement of anything
from 35 to 38 inches, depending entirely on the development of the bust.
Therefore to calculate important measurements affecting the balance and fit
of a garment from such an inconstant factor in relationship to the actual
frame of the body as the bust measurement is to court disaster. To base the
balance of a coat, position of the armhole, depth of armhole, width across
front shoulders, etc., on a measurement that may be taken on the figure in a
position totally out of relationship to any of the above factors is to render
pattern construction completely unscientific.</p>
<p>To facilitate complete understanding of the system of cutting the master
pattern, the constructional stages will be described in some detail with the
logical reasons given for each point as we go along. Once the master pattern
is constructed in perfect balance, all other variations of style and seam
placement are more of the nature of pattern manipulation and as such can be
mastered by anyone with a knowledge of pattern construction.</p>
<p>A first essential of pattern construction is accurate measurements. Upon
these depends the success or otherwise of a cutting system, but whereas they
are of paramount importance in the retail trade as garments are cut to
individual measurements, in the wholesale trade we work to an imaginary
perfect figure, the measurements of which are decided by the average
measurements of a number of figures of similar bust size. Obviously there
must be some standard of measurements which conforms to the average
proportions of women of an equal bust size, but this standard must be varied
to suit the trade and district in which the garments are sold. In the West
End of London, for example, it is possible with success to make saleable
garments with a proportionate increase of 2 inches between the bust and hip
measurements, whereas this standard of proportion would be entirely
inadequate for the North of England.</p>
<p> For the purpose of the cutting system in this book, it is proposed to
base the draft on the proportion of 3 inches difference between the bust and
hip measurements. This is a proportion that works out very well in practice
and provides a balanced garment suitable for the majority of customers
desiring a well-fitting stock garment to fit the average woman. It must be
realized that a stock garment must have the qualities of being fairly long in
the back balance to lie well into the waist, easy over the bust to allow for
easy buttoning and to fit a size larger in bust than marked size, easy in the
armhole to fit over a jumper if necessary, and short in the front balance for
a snug fit at the lapel and back of collar.</p>
<p>To decide the shoulder balance of the pattern in respect of the front and
back depth of armhole, take a check measurement from the nape of the neck at
the back round under the armpit close up to the figure and up from the front
of the armhole across the shoulder to the starting point at the back of the
neck. The increase or decrease of this measurement automatically indicates
whether the figure has a long or short neck or square and sloping
shoulders.</p>
<p>This measurement the author has found very reliable in practice and one
that gives every satisfaction in measure cutting, and for this reason it has
been embodied in the system for drafting the base pattern.</p>
<p>The other measurements necessary are the net waist measurement, the hip
measurement, and across back width. The height of an average figure is also
necessary, for from this measurement we obtain our depth of armhole and
natural waist lengths on the principle of the eight-heads theory. This latter
theory of figure measurement is sadly neglected by the cutting fraternity as
a whole, but it needs only a little logic to understand that any increase in
height must be proportionately divided throughout the figure. The

measurements upon which the base draft is systematized are as
follows&#8212;</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>Height = 5 feet 4 inches.</li>
	<li>Natural waist length = 16 inches.</li>
	<li>Chest above bust prominence = 32 inches.</li>
	<li>Bust = 34 inches.</li>
	<li>Waist = 26 inches.</li>
	<li>Hips = 37 inches.</li>
	<li>Round arm measurement = 24 inches.</li>
	</ul>
<p>It should be pointed out that the pattern outline obtained from the
working out of the system is essentially modern in character, with a wide
shoulder effect, close fitting waist and close over the hips, and for
designers whose trade lies on easier fitting garments the system will also
provide for the necessary adjustment by simple deviations from the base
outline.</p>
<p> The system provides for seams round the armhole and gorge, and also down
the sideseams. It will be found in practice that this method of cutting base
patterns is most practical in general use as these seams are constant in
their allowances and need not be altered for different styles. All other
seams must be added where design lines are placed when cutting out the
patterns, 3/8-inch seams are allowed, this being the usual quantity absorbed
in the wholesale trade.</p>
<p>The draft also carries the requisite allowances for ease throughout bust,
waist, and hip measurements.</p>
<p>To proceed, commence drafting out the outline points as illustrated by
Fig. 346.</p>

Jacket Patterns (Fig. 346)</h3> 
<p>Commence from point X. This point represents the nape of the neck at the
centre back. Draw a straight line downwards the full length of pattern
required, approximately 24 inches.</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>1 from X for the depth of armhole is 7&frac34; inches.
	  <ul>
	    <li>This quantity can be calculated in two ways, each of which checks
    the other. The height of the normal figure is 62 inches, and calculating
	      on the basis of the eight-heads theory, one-eighth of this height gives
	      us a
    depth of armhole measurement of 7&frac34; inches. As a check to this method,
	      the application of the round armhole measurement will be explained
	      later in the
    system.</li>
      </ul>
	</li>
	<li>2 from X is the natural waist length.
	  <ul>
	    <li>This measurement can be taken either direct on the figure or
    calculated as one-quarter of the height = 15&frac12; inches, to which must
    be added the 3/8-inch seam allowed round the back neck.</li>
      </ul>
	</li>
	<il>3 from X = 8 inches down for the hip level.
<li>X to X = the fashion length.</li>
	<li> Square out from points X, 1, 2 and 3.</li>
	<li>4 from 1 = the half chest measurement, applied net.</li>
	<li>5 from 4 = 2&frac12; inches, the standard allowance for ease, and two
3/8-inch seams.</li>
	<li>6 from 1 = the half bust measurement plus 2&frac34; inches for ease and
seams.</li>
	<li>7 from 1 = half from 1 to 5 for the position of the scye.</li>
	</ul>
    <p>This division of the chest measurement illustrates the principle of
obtaining the basic constructional points from the chest measure in contrast
to the usual procedure of calculating from the bust measurement.</p>
<p> The position of the armhole or scye is of paramount importance in the
construction of a well-balanced pattern, and the method advocated here has
given excellent results. Logically, as the armhole is situated on the chest
line, and not on the bust line, it must follow that the position must be
decided by a division of the chest measurement placed in the correct location
in comparison with the front and back across widths.</p>
<p>The actual width of the scye is based on practical experience rather than
on proportions of either the chest or bust measurements. It is governed in
part by the back width, but for the purpose of wholesale pattern construction
an average width suitable for average figures is the most effective
method.</p>
<p>A 34-inch bust figure is found in practice to carry 4&frac12; inches width
  of
scye, and from this standard there should be an increase of &frac14; inch for
every 2 inches increase in the chest measurement. Chest measurement is taken
because, if the bust measurement is out of proportion, this has no bearing on
the width of the scye, which remains constant with the chest measurement.</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>Divide the width of scye equally each side of point 7 to 8 and 9.</li>
	<li>Therefore 8 from 7 = 2&frac14; inches and 9 from 7 = 2&frac14; inches.</li>
	</ul>
<p>We now have to consider the question of a cutting scale from which various
sections of the pattern draft are derived.</p>
<p>The cutting scale gives a basis of comparison and proportion by which the
draft is balanced equally in all its sections.</p>
<p>The author's cutting scale is based on a division of the chest
measurement, for the reason that stable parts of the body such as the width
of neck at back and front, slope of shoulders, etc., remain constant with the
chest measurement whatever the degree of development of the bust
measurement.</p>
<p>The method of finding the scale is to take one-half of the chest
measurement. This quantity applies up to and including 36 inches chest. Over
36 inches chest measurement the scale is found by taking one-third of the
chest measurement plus 6 inches.</p>
<p>To continue with the draft.</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>10 from X for the half back neck width = one-sixth of scale net.</li>
	<li>Square up from 10 to 11 for the shape of the back neck, &frac34; inch.</li>
	<li>12 from X for the back shoulder slope = 1 inch.</li>
	<li>Square up from 9 to intersect the line squared out from 12 at point
13.</li>
	<li>14 from 13 for the width of the back shoulder = 1 inch.</li>
	<li>Square up from 8 to 15 for the shape of the scye = 1&frac14; inches.</li>
	<li>Measure the width of the back neck from X to 11 and then apply half the
round shoulder measure from 8 to strike an arc at 16. Apply the same
measurement from point 6 plus the difference between half bust and half chest
measurements to intersect the arc at 16, thereby locating the neck point.</li>
	<li>Join 16 by a line to a point 1&frac12; inches above point 1 on the centre
back construction line.</li>
	<li>17 from 16 for the front shoulder width = the back shoulder width from
11 to 14 less &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>Join 15 to 17 and shape the front scye &frac12; inch inside the construction
line.</li>
	<li>18 from 6 = the half round shoulder measurement applied from 6 less the
width of back neck.</li>
	<li>Square out from 18 to 19 equal to the width from X to 10.</li>
	<li>Square down the centre front line from 6 to 20 and 21 on the

	<li>22 is squared out from 7, and 23 is a continuation of the line from 7
and 22.</li>
	<li>24 and 25 are each &frac12; inch from point 22 for the side waist
suppression.</li>
	<li>26 from 21 = the half waist measurement plus 1 inch to 1&frac12; inches
	  for
ease, depending upon style.</li>
	<li>27 from 26 = the waist suppression from 24 to 25 plus 3/8 inch for
seams.</li>
	<li>28 is halfway between points 27 to 20.</li>

hip measurements = 1&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>Shape the front and back sideseams as shown.</li>
	<li>33 from 1 = 2 inches.</li>
	<li>34 from 6 = 3 inches.</li>
	<li>Join 33 to 34 for the actual breast position.</li>
	<li>Join 20 to 17 to locate the bust point at 35 on the intersection of the

	<li>Suppress &frac12; inch at 38 and complete the shape of the back panel seams
from 40 to the waist and up to the shoulder at 38.</li>
	<li>41 from 18 = one-sixth of scale plus &frac14; inch.</li>
	<li>42 from 6 = 1&frac12; inches for the front edge beyond the centre line,
	  for
the single-breasted button fronts.</li>
	<li>43 from the bottom edge line = &frac12; inch. Shape the bottom edge run from
43 to the sideseam.</li>
	<li>Complete the shape of the lapel as illustrated.</li>
	<li>The front pitch is located diagonally at A from point 8 and the back
pitch B is half X to 1 up from point 9 on the chest line.</li>
	</ul>
<p>The draft now completed provides for an easy-fitting jacket over the bust
line, with a slight drape at the front of scye, slightly draped back scye,
and a square wide shoulder appearance. Made up pads are allowed for in the
shoulders and must be inserted to get the best results from the system.</p>
<p>The waist and hip fitting are snug to the figure and the front bust dart
and panel seam treatment accentuates the figure in the modern manner. It will
be seen that there are a number of alterations from the standard basis draft
given in Chapter III of this work, but this is understandable when it is
realized that a wholesale jacket must fit a variety of figures and should be
of such easy fitting proportions through the shoulders to fit any variations
of these measurements in an increased quantity. The average wholesale jacket
will fit a 35-inch bust figure quite well when the size ticket indicates a
34-inch bust, and it is to meet these contingencies that variations have
taken place in the wholesale system in comparison to the bespoke diagrams.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a name="sidebody" id="sidebody"></a><em><a href="illust/347.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,530);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/347-t.jpg" alt="Figure 347" width="170" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig347" id="fig347"></a>Sidebody Jacket Draft (Fig. 347)</h3>
<p>The foregoing has described the basis system for panel front and back
jacket styles, and this draft will describe the drafting alterations
necessary for the production of a sidebody jacket.</p>
<p> This style of jacket is perhaps more popular to-day than the panelled
jacket, as there is a tendency for ladies' jackets to become simpler in style
and more approximating to the style of a man's lounge coat.</p>
<p>The draft retains the panel front for perfection of bust and waist
fitting, and the back is drafted from a whole back block pattern extending to
the underarm sideseam.</p>
<p> The outline points are the same as for the panel draft, and to make the
alteration into a sidebody lounge back style proceed as follows&#8212;</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>C from 2 = &frac34; inch in all instances.</li>
	<li>D from 3 = the back hip suppression &frac12; inch in all standard
measurements.</li>
	<li>E is located at 2 inches up from the bust line on the back scye for the
top of the sidebody.</li>
	<li>F from C = half of the bust scale as a general guide for the width of
the back at the waist.</li>
	</ul>
<p>While this measurement is given, it must be understood that this is only a

<p>The other standard basic draft for ladies' jackets is the block front
style, without front panel seam and relying on waist darts for the waist
suppression.</p>
<p> Fig. 348 also illustrates a variation of the back. This consists of a
centre back seam with two panel seams over the blades.</p>
<p> The back part is as follows&#8212;</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>The outline points of the block pattern are the same as Fig. 346, the
basis draft, and to make the variation for the centre back seam mark in from
2 to C &frac34; inch in all instances.</li>
	<li>D from 3 = the hip suppression quantity of &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>Shape the centre back seam from D through C up to the centre back neck
point at X, suppressing &frac14; inch at the breast construction line.</li>
	<li>E from 11 for the position of the panel seam at the shoulder = 2&frac12;
inches or &frac12; inch more than the position of the corresponding seam on the
front shoulder.</li>
	<li>F from C at the waist line for the position of the panel seam = from 2&frac12; to
	  3 inches according to style and the personal views of the
designer.</li>
	<li>G from D for the position of the panel seam at the hip level = from 3&frac14; to
	  3&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>Shape the side panel seam from E to F and G and down to the hem
line.</li>
	<li>H from F = the remainder of the back waist suppression as decided from
the basis draft.</li>
	<li>Shape the remaining panel seam from G through H and up to the shoulder
seam at E, suppressing &frac12; inch at E for the shape over the blades.</li>
	</ul>
<p>This completes the draft of the back part, and we will now proceed with
the necessary manipulation of the block front pattern to eliminate the panel
seam.</p>
<p> Cut through the pattern on the front panel seams from the hem line up to
the bust point at 35, and then by pivoting from 35 place the two edges of the
panel seams together at the hem line as illustrated by the diagram and
indicated by the dash lines.</p>
<p> This pattern manipulation will have the effect of opening up the bust
dart from 35 to 36 and 37, and this increase will have the further effect of
increasing the bust shape that has been previously reduced by the closing out
of the front panel suppression.</p>
<p> Mark in the first waist dart in the position indicated on the diagram and
reduce at K the amount of waist suppression shown between the dash lines at
the waist.</p>
<p> The standard waist dart suppression of &frac34; inch is taken out of the
pattern at J.</p>
<p> Add 1&frac12; inches at the front edge to complete the draft.</p>

<p>Fig. 349 illustrates the draft of a popular style of ladies' sports jacket
and illustrates a more complicated method of pattern manipulation.</p>
<p> This style has a yoke across the back and front shoulders with the back
gathered into the yoke to give fullness and ease of movement. The bodice is
also gathered into the front shoulder in a like manner to balance up the
style points.</p>
<p>A half-belt is shown across the back waist, and the back skirt part of the
jacket below the waist is cut without any seams or panels.</p>
<p> Two waist darts are indicated on each side of the foreparts, and four
patch pockets complete the style points. The fronts button high up to the
neck line, finished with a small single-breasted lapel.</p>
<p>The back pattern manipulation is shown by Fig. 349, and to obtain the
required pattern a solid block pattern of the back is utilized.</p>
<p> Points X, 11, 14, 7, 24, 32, 3, 2 and 11 are the same as described by
Fig. 346.</p>
<p> To construct the amended pattern, first fix the position of the shoulder
yoke seam down from the shoulders. For the purpose of this draft, the
shoulder yoke is placed at half the distance from X to 1 and located at A.</p>
<p> Square across from A to B as shown by the dash-line.</p>
<p>The back waist suppression quantity of 1&frac34; inches is marked out on the
waist seam at points C and D, being spaced at approximately 3 and 6 inches
from the centre back construction line at 2.</p>
<p>The back hip suppression quantity of &frac12; inch is marked out at E, and the
other pivoting point F is located at approximately 3 inches from E.</p>
<p>These measurements are given approximately, as they would naturally vary
with different size waist and hip measurements.</p>
<p>The shoulder yoke cut separately from the back is shown by Fig. 349
(b).</p>
<p> Take the pattern and split through from C to G and from D to H as shown
by the dash lines. Close the dash lines together at C and D and then open out
the dash lines at G and H by pivoting from C and D. The amount these dash
lines are opened decides the amount of fullness to be gathered into the
shoulder yoke. In this instance, each dash line has been opened out by 1&frac12;
inches in each point, giving a total quantity of fullness equal to 3 inches
on the half back and 6 inches across the whole back shoulder. This quantity
is ample for fullness, and any excess only tends to affect the fit of the
jacket under the scye towards the front by a lack of control.</p>
<p> The skirt of the back is manipulated into shape by closing out the &frac12;
inch of back hip suppression at E and then, by opening up the dash lines from
E to C and F to D, obtaining the solid pattern outline as indicated by the
points from 2 to C, D, 24 and 32.</p>
<p>The back patterns are completed by adding seams from A to B on the
shoulder yoke seam, from A, G, H and B on the lower shoulder yoke seam, and
from 2 to C, D and 24 on the across waist seam.</p>
<p>Add a seam across the back skirt waist seam from 2 to C, D and 24 to
complete the construction of the back patterns.</p>

350)</h3> 
<p>Fig. 350 illustrates the pattern manipulation necessary to obtain the
shoulder yoke and front bodice fullness.</p>
<p> First close out the front panel seams from the hem line to the bust point
at 35 to obtain a seamless front pattern, and then proceed to fix the
position of the front shoulder yoke down from the shoulder.</p>
<p>While the position of the shoulder yoke is a matter of personal taste, the
following measurements give a good idea of general style.</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>A from 17 is 4&frac12; inches down on the front of the scye for the
termination of the shoulder yoke in the scye.</li>
	<li>B is 4 inches down from the gorge run at the neck on the centre line of
the position of the shoulder yoke at the centre front.</li>
	<li>Square across from B at the centre line to locate point C midway the two
bust dart seams.</li>
	<li>Square across from C to locate points D and E on the shoulder darts
seams, making E from 36 = to 37 to D.</li>
	<li>Join B to D and E to A for the run of the shoulder yoke seam.</li>
	</ul>
<p>The appearance of the broken seam run from B to D and from E to A is
necessary, so that when the shoulder dart is closed together this seam will
make one unbroken seam line.</p>
<p> If the seam had been marked across the shoulder in a continuous line,
when the shoulder dart had been closed together, a point would have appeared
at points E and D instead of the unbroken seam that is required. So the
procedure is to square out to the centre of the shoulder dart and then make
the joining points on each seam of the shoulder dart equal in length down
from the shoulder seam.</p>
<p> The shoulder yoke is now 1&frac12; inches smaller than the corresponding
  seam of the forepart from A to E, D and B, and as this quantity is insufficient
  to
give fullness over the bust with regard to the fact that the style of the
jacket requires an extra quantity of width under the yoke, it is necessary to
manipulate the forepart pattern in the following manner to increase the
fullness.</p>
<p> Cut through the dash lines from E and D to 35 and from 35 down to the hem
line. By pivoting from the hem line at G, wedge open the pattern at 35
approximately &frac12; inch to obtain the reconstructed pattern points from E
to
E1, A to A1 and 7 to 7<span class="small">1</span>. The pattern will also open
at 25, but as the fullness is not required below the bust, point 25 is retained
in its original
position and the sideseam is re-shaped back from 7<span class="small">1</span> to
25 as shown by the
diagram. We now have a quantity of 2 to 2&frac12; inches of fullness in the
shoulder yoke seam of the foreparts, and this quantity is sufficient for
normal style purposes.</p>
<p> The quantity of front waist suppression shown between the front panel
dash lines is taken out in the form of dart at point F, and the suppression
of the waist is completed by the standard waist dart of &frac34; inch at H.</p>
<p> This completes the pattern manipulation of the foreparts to obtain the
shoulder yoke and bust fullness, and the draft is completed by adding 1&frac12;
inches for the front edge beyond the centre line and shaping out the single-breasted
lapel as indicated by the diagram.</p>
<h3 class="clear"> <a name="canvas" id="canvas"></a><em><a href="illust/351.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,624);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/351-t.jpg" alt="" width="201" height="190" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig351" id="fig351"></a>Construction of the Canvas Pattern
(Fig. 351)</h3>
<p>The construction of canvas patterns is of paramount importance in the
wholesale trade as the shape of the coat depends entirely on the interlining
retaining its shape in wear. The making-up of a jacket in wholesale
production naturally has not the skilled handwork of a man-tailored garment
with its manipulation, pressing into shape, and general detailed work. Very
often the work is made in its entirety by tailoresses, and when the jacket is
finished it may be pressed-off on a flat Hoffman steam press and,
consequently, stands a good chance of losing whatever shape the makers-up
have succeeded in working into it.</p>
<p>Therefore it is very essential that the framework of canvas should
be cut in a shape to agree with the designed outline of the jacket, and made
in such a way that it retains its shape.</p>
<p> While a ladies' jacket canvas has not the reinforced shoulder haircloth
padding of the similar man's jacket canvas as a general rule, it is sometimes
advisable to make the canvas on the lines of a man's canvas if a permanent
shape is desired. The majority of ladies' tailors use flax canvas for jackets
to obtain a soft front effect, but the tendency to-day is to use a more
substantial interlining, and various types of syddo are now in use. In the
National Press and trade papers many retail shops are advertising their
tailor-mades and coats as having unbreakable fronts, stressing the fact that
their garments retain their shape in wear, and this is a revolutionary step
in the right direction towards raising the standard of factory-made garments
in the public mind. Too often the main objection to factory-made garments has
not been over the question of style, but over the question of make and
whether the garment will keep its first shape in the course of wear.</p>
<p> Generally speaking, so far as style is concerned, the productions of a
good wholesale firm specializing in tailor-mades and coats are equal to the
best measure garments after minor adjustments are made. Too often, measure
garments are so fitted and recut about that their original shape and balance
are completely distorted and the result may be a fit so far as fit is
required, but something that lacks style.</p>
<p>The wholesale garment, on the other hand, is designed and cut to an ideal,
that of the perfectly balanced garment, with concentration on style as well,
and so with minor adjustments it will retain its predesigned style and
character. That is not to say that the top-class cutter in a retail house
cannot improve on the wholesale. He can, admittedly, but every tailoring
house in the retail ladies' trade has not the services of a highly-skilled
cutter, and it is these smaller businesses that are in the greatest danger
from wholesale competition. For a wholesale designer has only to concentrate
on increasing the high standard of his productions in the realm of fit and
style, and it follows that, by virtue of being a highly-paid specialist, his
productions have all the advantages over those of his less skilled prototype
in the retail trade.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the wholesale trade cannot and does not wish to cope
with the difficult figures of this world, and that is where the retail trade
will always have its outlet. For these disproportionate figures need a good
deal of fitting to approach anything like a satisfactory fit, and if they
obtain that satisfaction then they are less concerned as to whether the
garment carries the latest ideas in shoulder width or waist shape.</p>
<p>But to continue with the subject of canvas cutting for the wholesale
trade. There are many methods of cutting the canvases. Some are good, but
others leave a lot to be desired, as it often happens that designers
underestimate the value and necessity of a good foundation for the shape of
their garments and leave the cutting of the canvases to the tailor or
tailoresses making the garment. But the question cannot be ignored, otherwise
the production will suffer, with consequent fall in the demand for the
wholesale firms' orders.</p>
<p>First it must be realized that the canvas must conform to the shape of the
outer cloth in all respects of suppression and shape. Too often canvases are
put into coats that bear no relation to the outside of the garment, and the
consequence is that in the course of pressing-off the garment, both canvas
and cloth suffer distortion, resulting in loss of shape and a garment lacking
the essentials for retaining the predesigned style points.</p>
<p>Fig. 351 (A) illustrates the first method of cutting the canvas. Take the
forepart pattern and mark round the shape of the front edge, shoulders, and
front of scye. The front half of the canvas has an identical run with the
front panel seam from shoulder seam to hem line as illustrated. The second
part of the canvas, i.e. the shoulder part, is cut identically with the shape
of the panel seam from waist level to bust point, and shaped up from the
waist in a straight line to the front pitch.</p>
<p> From the bust point it follows the run of the panel seam to within 4
inches of the shoulder seam, and then &frac12; inch of spring towards the front of
the jacket is added as diagram. This shaped seam when sewn to the front panel
seam produces a certain amount of ease at the front of the scye to compensate
for the necessary ease over the shoulder point.</p>
<p>Add &frac12; inch of extra width to the canvas round the front of the scye,
across the shoulder seam, round the gorge and step of the lapel, and, to
complete, down the front of the lapel to the position of the first button.
From the first button to the hem line the canvas is cut to the shape of the
front edge.</p>
<p> A seam must be added to the shoulder part of the canvas from A to B and
C, and when the canvas is made the two edges should be overlapped one seam
and machined up together overlapped, and not sewn out in an ordinary seam.</p>
<p> Fig. 351 (B) shows the same canvas cut without the suppression from waist
to bust point. In this canvas the bust dart terminates at the bust point, and
the waist suppression from A to B is substituted by a diagonal dart from D to
the bust point and is obtained by closing out the waist dart at A to B.</p>
<p> Fig. 351 (C) shows the usual reinforcement pattern. This is obtained by
closing together the two sides of the bust dart and then shaping the edge of
the reinforcement pattern to run &frac12; inch behind the crease line for
approximately 6 inches, and then shaped down to the bust point and back to
the front pitch point as shown by the diagram. A cut through the shoulder is
made at E to F, 3 inches in length, and when the reinforcement is laid over
the canvas this dart opens to fit the &frac12; inch of spring infused into the
canvas at C.</p>

<p>The points set out in Chapter V apply equally to the cutting of sleeves in
the wholesale trade, but in addition it is necessary to be able to produce a
sleeve that has a clean-hanging appearance at the back when on a model or
display stand. The secret of this clean-hanging sleeve, which, in addition,
possesses the required amount of freedom of movement, is what is termed
&quot;drape&quot; in the tailoring trade, that is, a sleeve that has a
reserve of material at back and front, which when the arm is moved comes into
play, and yet when the arm is at the side lies cleanly in a soft fold at back
and front of the scye.</p>
<p> A high crown to the sleeve head also makes for a clean-hanging sleeve,
and the method of sewing the sleeve into the scye also plays its part in the
final result. At the front of the scye, the sleeve must be well fulled in so
that the fullness has the effect of allowing the sleeve to fold forward over
the arm muscle, and at the back scye the undersleeve should be fulled in by
at least &frac34; inch to allow the hindarm of the sleeve to fold back over the
scye. These folds at back and front come into play when the arm is moved and
then lie close to the coat when the arm is at rest.</p>
<p> Fig. 352 illustrates the draft of the sleeve in conjunction with a normal
scye draft.</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>Point A is the front pitch, marked on the scye diagonally from the front
of scye point.</li>
	<li>B is the standard position of the back sleeve pitch, located at half the
back depth of scye up from the chest line.</li>
	<li>C is the fashion sleeve pitch at the back scye, located at 1&frac12; inches
down from B.</li>
	<li>D is the shoulder point of the back shoulder.</li>
	<li>E is the front shoulder point.</li>
	<li>15 is 1&frac12; inches up from the base of the scye, located on the front
	  of
scye line.</li>
	<li>E on the front scye is one seam below point E.</li>
	</ul>
<p>Commence the sleeve draft by squaring across from F to G on the back scye
line.</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>H is one seam below the level of the back shoulder point at D.</li>
	<li>J for the crown height is located at midway G to H, and this point J
represents the actual level of the shoulder of the jacket on the figure when
the shoulder seams are sewn together.</li>
	<li>Square a line out from J for the crown height level.</li>
	<li>From point F and pivoting from 15 at the front of scye, sweep out to
locate point K, 5/8 inch from F.</li>
	<li>Square down from K to L on the line squared out from the scye pitch
B.</li>
	</ul>
<p>Now we come to the question of fullness in the sleeve. A draped sleeve
effect can only be achieved by the addition of essential fullness in the
sewing in of the sleeve, and the quantity for this draft is decided at 2
inches.</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>So mark from L to M 2 inches for the fullness addition. </li>
	<li>Then measure
  from the back sleeve pitch B up to the shoulder point at D and apply this
  quantity direct and net from M to N.</li>
	<li>Square out from the fashion pitch at C to obtain the point MN, which is
1&frac14; to 1&frac12; inches from a line squared directly down from N.</li>
	<li>Shape the run of the sleeve head from MN through N, midway through G and
J, round to K and down to 15 at the front of scye, making the sleeve run
between K and 15 approximately &frac14; inch from the front of scye.</li>
	<li>Line through from K and 15 to locate point O, equal to the distance A is
from 15.</li>
	<li>Add a 3/8-inch seam from O to P as indicated.</li>
	<li>Square down from P to Q, the forearm length plus one seam.</li>
	<li>Square out from Q to R 1 inch for the necessary forward hang of the
sleeve.</li>
	<li>S is midway P to R for the position of the elbow.</li>
	<li>By the line from P to R, square out from S for the elbow line
position.</li>
	<li>T from S = 1&frac14; inches for the shape of the forearm.</li>
	<li>Shape the forearm up from R to T and P.</li>
	<li>U from T = the distance P is from the forearm seam at A, after a seam
has been added forward from A as shown.</li>
	<li>V from R, squared out from R = from U to T.</li>
	<li>By pivoting from point N, sweep back an arc from midway V to R to locate
point W at the hindarm.</li>
	<li>W from midway R to V = the cuff width plus two seams.</li>
	<li>X from the line joining W to N = 1&frac34; inches for the sleeve width at
the elbow.</li>
	<li>Y is &frac12; inch from X.</li>
	<li>Z is 1 inch from the back pitch at C. Shape forward one seam and
complete the shape of the under-sleeve as shown in the draft.</li>
	<li>Shape down the hindarm seams from MN to X and W and from Z to Y and
W.</li>

<p>1. A solid block outline of the back and forepart, joined together at the
sideseams as shown by Fig. 354 (a).</p>
<p> 2. Back and forepart cut separately as Fig. 354 (b).</p>
<p> 3. Outline patterns of the panel back style as Fig. 354 (c).</p>

<p>All balance marks should be inserted on the patterns, and also pitch
points and breast waist and hip level lines.</p>

<p>This completes the draft of the front of the skirt block pattern.</p>
<h5>THE BACK SKIRT DRAFT</h5>
<p> Commence from point 12 at the centre back waist.</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>13 from 12 = 8 inches down for the hip level.</li>
	<li>4 from 13 = one-fourth of the hip measurement plus &frac14; inch.</li>
	<li>The hip measurement has now in effect had 1 inch added for ease.</li>
	<li>15 from 12 = one-fourth of the waist measurement plus 1&frac12; inches added
for the standard back waist dart quantity.</li>
	<li>16 from 12 = &frac12; inch. Shape the waist seam from 16 to 15.</li>
	<li>17 from 12 = 4 inches for the position of the back waist dart
centre.</li>
	<li>18 from 17 = &frac34; inch.</li>
	<li>19 from 17 = &frac34; inch.</li>
	<li>Shape out the back waist dart from 18 and 19 down to 20, making the dart
6 inches in length.</li>
	<li>21 is squared down from 14 and is equal to the sideseam length plus a
seam from 15 measured through 14.</li>
	<li>22 from 21 = 1&frac12; inches. Shape the sideseam from 21 up to 14 and 15
	  as
shown.</li>
	<li>23 from 16 = the full skirt length.</li>
	<li>Shape the hem line from 23 through 21 to 22.</li>
	</ul>
<p>This completes the draft of the skirt block pattern, and when cutting from
the material an inlay should be added down each sideseam and 2 or 3 inches
hem as required.</p>

Manipulation of the Skirt Block Pattern (Fig. 356)</h3> 
<p> Fig. 356 shows the use of the skirt block pattern in practice, and for
the purpose of the diagram a skirt with an inverted pleat at centre front,
two knife pleats at the side front, and an inverted pleat at centre back is
taken.</p>
<p> The skirt also has a slight flare at the sideseams, and represents a very
fashionable and useful &quot;odd&quot; skirt style.</p>
<p> The method of adding the side knife pleats and the centre back inverted
pleat is in keeping with modern practice, which aims at eliminating excess
material inside the skirt.</p>
<p> Take the front skirt block pattern and cut through from the hem up to the
end of the front waist dart at 11, and then by pivoting from 11, close points
9 to 10 to open the width of the skirt at the hem.</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>A from point 8 = 14 inches up from the hem for the length of the centre
front inverted pleat.</li>
	<li>B from A = the width of the front pleat 3&frac12; to 4 inches.</li>
	<li>C from 8 = the width of the pleat as above.</li>
	<li>Join points C and B for the fold edge of the pleat.</li>
	<li>D is half A to B, and then mark up from D to E.</li>
	<li>F for the position of the side knife pleat = 2&frac12; inches from 7.</li>
	<li>G from 8 = 3&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>Join G to F for the centre of the knife pleat.</li>
	<li>H from G = 2 inches.</li>
	<li>J from G = 2 inches.</li>
	<li>Mark up the edges of the knife pleats from J and H to K and L.</li>
	<li>K and L, are 14 inches from the hem line and each point &frac12; inch from
the centre line of the pleat. N and M are equal to K and L from point F.</li>
	</ul>
<h5>THE BACK SKIRT DRAFT</h5>
<p> Take the back skirt block pattern and split through from the hem up to
the back waist dart at 20 and then close out the dart from 18 to 19, half the
total width of the dart, making the dart &frac34; inch in width.</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>Add &frac12; inch from 16 to O and &frac12; inch from O to P for the top width of
the tapered inverted pleat.</li>
	<li>Q from 23 = 2 inches.</li>
	<li>R from Q = 2 inches for the width of the inverted pleat at the hem.</li>
	<li>Mark up the crease lines of the pleat from Q to O and from R to P, and
then add &frac12; inch seam from P to S and from R to T.</li>
	<li>Add 1 inch inlay down the sideseam from 15 to 22 as shown, with a small
step at each end so that the machinist has no difficulty in sewing out the
right quantity.</li>
	<li>Add similar V steps to the dart and pleat as indicated.</li>
	</ul>
<p>This type of tapered pleat is usually edge-stitched down its entire length
on the outer and inner edges so that it remains in crease in wear.</p>

357)</h3> 
<p> Fig. 357 illustrates the cutting of an all-round knife-pleated skirt,
with tapered knife pleats from the waist to the hem. All the pleats are
edge-stitched and will remain in place in wear. This type of skirt has had a
great success, and justly so, as it combines a very clean fit over the hips
without the added bulk of material inside which most all-round pleated skirts
have.</p>
<p> Extreme care must be taken with the making-up of this skirt as there is a
tendency for the material to stretch under the machine where it is
unavoidably cut on the bias.</p>
<p> When cutting from the material, contrary to the usual practice, the
sideseam is placed on the straight of the material so that the centre of the
skirt comes on the bias. This method of cutting ensures the pleats over the
sideseams hanging cleanly over the hips.</p>
<p> Commence by taking a front skirt block pattern and close out the front
waist dart as described in Fig. 356 to eliminate the waist dart and to widen
the hem width.</p>
<p> Points 4, 6, 7 and 8 are identical with previous drafts. Take the
distance from 4 to 7 and divide into four equal parts, which, in the example
of a 26-inch waist, makes each fourth part equal to 1 5/8 inches.</p>
<p> This division of the pattern provides for three pleats each side of the
centre front pleat.</p>
<p> Take the distance from 6 to 8 and divide by four. In this example, each
fourth equals 4 inches.</p>
<p> Join points A, B and C to points D, E and F at the hem line.</p>
<p> These lines are the pleating lines for the knife pleats.</p>
<p> Fig. 457 (b) shows the method of obtaining the knife pleats&#8212;</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>Cut through the pattern from A to D and open out.</li>
	<li>AA from A = 1 inch.</li>
	<li>DD from D = 3&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>Mark the crease edges of the first pleat from A to D and from AA to DD
and join D to DD and A to AA.</li>
	<li>Cut through the pattern from B to E and open out.</li>
	<li>BB from B = 1 inch.</li>
	<li>EE from E = 3&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>Mark the crease edges of the second pleat from B to E and from BB to
EE.</li>
	<li>Join E to EE and B to BB.</li>
	<li>Cut through the pattern from C to F and open out.</li>
	<li>CC from C = 1 inch.</li>
	<li>FF from F = 3&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>Mark the crease edges of the knife pleats from C to F and from CC to
FF.</li>
	<li>Join C to CC and F to FF.</li>
	<li>On the sideseam add 1 inch inlay at 4 and from 2 to 2A.</li>
	<li>G from 6 = 2&frac14; inches allowing for a seam.</li>
	<li>Join 2A to G for the sideseam knife pleat and complete by joining G to
6.</li>
	<li>At the centre front add 1 inch from 7 to H and 2&frac14; inches from 8 to
	  J
for the centre front pleat.
	  <ul>
	    <li>This quantity allows for the necessary seam down the centre front,
    which as it is cut on the bias cannot be cut on the fold of the
    material.</li>
      </ul>
	</li>
	</ul>
<p> This pattern is now completed and is suitable for both the back and front
parts of the skirt.</p>
<p> The edges of all the pleats should be stitched both on the outer and
inner edges right through to the hem line.</p>
<h3> <a name="grading" id="grading"></a>Grading for the Wholesale Trade</h3> 
<p> Grading of patterns plays an important part in the work of a wholesale
designer and pattern cutter, for when he has made a successful sample and
repeat orders are taken on it, it is necessary to cut a range of sizes
incorporating the identical balance, style and fit of the original sample.</p>
<p> Now it is not always possible to undertake, and certainly the amount of
time at any designer's disposal does not warrant, the elaborate process of
cutting three or more sizes of patterns by system in order to obtain the
intermediate pattern sizes as could be done in the retail trade when cutting
out a set of block patterns. Hence a good knowledge of pattern construction
and the amounts and increases in each section of the pattern is essential in
order to eliminate the necessity for drafting more than one pattern to obtain
other sizes exact in style and balance to the original.</p>
<p> Sometimes it is only necessary to cut two other sizes from the
original&#8212;it all depends on how the garment sells and in what sizes.
Usually in a general wholesale trade dealing with normal fashion as distinct
from specialist houses that make for outsizes, a range of sizes from 32-inch
bust to 40-inch bust is sufficient, but here again much depends on the type
of trade catered for by the retail house to which the garments are sold. Some
retail departments sell only from 34-inch to 38-inch bust, while others sell
in American sizes (see size chart given in <a href="lgcm-02.html">Chapter II</a>). But whatever is the
case it is a simple matter with a knowledge of pattern construction to be
able to produce from one perfect pattern a range of sizes identical in
balance and fit.</p>
<p> Our knowledge of measurements and system tells us that the back neck
width increases approximately 1/8 inch per 2 inches of bust size, and that
the back width increases approximately 3/8 inch for every 2-inch difference
of the bust. Similarly, throughout the entire pattern the variations of size
can be fixed and a set of graded patterns obtained without the process of
drafting out each pattern singly by system.</p>

<p> Fig. 358 shows the grade of a jacket back from size 34-inch to 40-inch
bust. Take the 34-inch bust pattern, and, commencing at the back neck point
Q, mark up four &frac14; inch points to represent the necessary increases in back
depth for the four given sizes.</p>
<p>Then at point A on the back neck, mark forward 1/8 inch for every 2-inch
difference of bust size, making four-eighths of an inch in all. Then square
across from point A to intersect these four lines, and on the first line
raise the back neck point A &frac14; inch. On the second line raise &frac12; inch, and
on the third line raise &frac34; inch to represent the back neck point A for a
40-inch bust size jacket.</p>
<p> At the back shoulder, mark a line square down with the shoulder end point
B, and then mark forward from this point three lines at intervals of 3/8
inch. Square out from point B to intersect these three lines, and then on the
first line raise the shoulder point B &frac14; inch. On the second line raise &frac12;
inch, and on the third raise the back shoulder point &frac34; inch to complete the
grade of the back shoulder.</p>
<p> At the top of the sideseam at point C, mark out 3/8 inch for every 2
inches increase in the breast girth. At point D, mark out 3/8 inch for every
2 inches of increase in the waist girth. Lastly, at the hip level mark out
3/8 inch for every 2 inches of increase in the hip level.</p>
<p> Mark round the sidebody pattern, and then at the breast line add 1/8 inch

<p> The accompanying draft of a child's coat will satisfy the need for a
practical system that can be adapted for the cutting of either boys' or
girls' coats. The waist length of children varies a great deal through the
various ages and a good size scale is essential for the producer of
children's clothing. Other points are the provision for an easy scye for
getting into the garment and a generally easy fit to allow for growing.</p>
<p> The draft illustrates the cutting of a panelled coat, buttoning up to the
neck with a prussian collar and flared from below the waist down to the
hem.</p>
<p> The measurements for the draft are as follows&#8212;</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>Breast = 26 inches.</li>
	<li>Waist = 24 inches.</li>
	<li>Waist length = 11 inches.</li>

	<li>4 from X = one-sixth of scale less &frac14; inch.</li>
	<li>5 from 4 = &frac34; inch. Shape the back neck run from 5 to X.</li>
	<li>Square out from 1 to 6 for the breast line and make 6 from 1 equal to
half the breast measurement plus 3 inches.</li>
	<li>7 from 6 for the across chest width = half scale less &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>8 from 1 = half back width plus one seam.</li>
	<li>9 is midway 7 to 8 for the position of the sideseam.</li>
	<li>10 from X for the shoulder slope = 1 inch. Square out from 10 to

inch out from the point of intersection.</li>
	<li>Shape the back shoulder seam from 11 to 5.</li>
	<li>12 from 7 for the front neckpoint = one-sixth of scale plus 1 inch.</li>

	<li>Square down from 6 to 15 and 16 at the hem line.</li>
	<li>17 from 15 = &frac14; inch. Draw the centre front line from 6 through 17 to
the hem line.</li>
	<li>Square up from 16 to 18, making 18 from 6 equal to 12 to 13.</li>
	<li>19 from 18 = one-sixth of scale. Shape the neck run from 19 to 13 and
then take out a &frac12;-inch cut at 19 down the centre front line, making the cut
3 &frac12; inches in length.</li>
	<li>Square down from 9 to 20 and 21 at the sideseams and then shape out the
sideseams, suppressing &frac34; inch from 22 to 23 and overlapping 3 inches from
24 to 25.</li>
	<li>26 from 2 = 3 inches.</li>
	<li>27 from 5 = 2 inches.</li>
	<li>28 from 3 = 5&frac12; inches. Shape the back panel seam from 28 to 26 and
27.</li>
	<li>29 from 28 = 4 inches.</li>
	<li>30 from 26 = 1 inch. Shape the side back panel seam 27, 30 to 29.</li>

	<li>38 from 16 = 4 inches. Shape the front of the coat as illustrated to
complete the draft.</li>
	</ul>
<p>The front pitch is found on the diagonal line from 7 and the back pitch B
at half the back depth from X to 1 up from 8.</p>
<p> The sleeve for this coat can be drafted on the principles laid down by

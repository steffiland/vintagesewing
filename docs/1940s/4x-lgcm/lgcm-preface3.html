  <h2>    <font

			face="Arial">Preface to Third Edition</font></h2>
  <p>THE presentation of the third edition of LADIES' GARMENT CUTTING AND MAKING
    establishes the work as the most successful of all independent cutting and
  tailoring treatises. </p>
  <p> There has always been a demand for this work that has outstripped the publisher's
      capacity to supply, and this can only be explained by the fact that within
      its pages readers are given the benefit of knowledge and experience that
      have withstood the test of time.</p>
  <p>It has been most gratifying to the author to receive so many letters of
    appreciation of its contents, to hear of technical and trade schools where
    the system is taught from the book, and to hear it referred to as the &quot;Encyclop&aelig;dia
    of the Ladies' Tailoring Trade.&quot;</p>
  <p>Little was it suspected in 1935 when the first edition was published that
    it would become a classic in the trade. But that is undoubtedly so and, whilst
    styling has changed, the basic principles laid down are still applicable
    to pattern cutting to-day. In 1935 there was a dearth of technical knowledge
    on the ladies' tailoring trade and the work more than adequately met the
    needs of practitioners. But it would have enjoyed only a temporary success
    if the subject-matter had been too theoretical and out of touch with the
    needs of the trade. This was not so, however, and to-day there is still an
    active and indeed increasing demand for it.</p>
  <p>In this third edition there is much that could not be revised or improved
    upon. The style factor was the only one where revision was called for; but
    style is of a transitory nature and the principles of pattern cutting contained
    in this work are adaptable to all changes of styling, and it could hardly
    be drastically revised on that score alone. One could revise methods of making,
    but here again they are a matter for individuals and the readers of this
    work will all have their own methods.</p>
  <p>I have therefore included a brief <a href="lgcm-app.html">Appendix</a> which describes the necessary
    adjustments to the basis systems for modern outlines, together with many
    new illustrations of present-day styles.</p>
  <p>In conclusion, may I tender to past and present readers my thanks for their
    appreciation, and to all future readers my best wishes for the success that
    I hope I may assist them to achieve.</p>
  <p>F. R. M.</p>

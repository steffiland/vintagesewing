  </p>  
  <p>THERE is to-day a great variety of skirt styles in vogue, for the
participation of women in sport in growing numbers means the designing and
making of suitable garments for sports wear, and the skirt style is an
important factor in the design of every sports suit.</p>
<p>Far from having only the status of a part of a costume, skirts are now
designed specially for golfing, motoring, hiking and beach-wear. For golfing
and motoring purposes, we have the divided trouser-skirt ideally suited to
either pursuit    and, in addition, for tennis wear. The beach-wear wrap
skirt for wearing over shorts, and the shorts-skirt embodying the features of
both garments, are examples of the adaptability of the skirt to present-day
needs.</p>
<p>Skirt design generally tends towards simple effects, with more attention
paid to perfection of cut and line than to intricate design. Skirts are
narrow at the hem line with pleats or slit openings to provide stride room in
the case of skirts buttoning down the front or back. The gored skirt with
four or more panels has a slight flare at the hem from the knee level
downwards, but with this style very little flare must be added, for, unless
the material used is very pliable, the hang of the skirt will be distorted.
Pleats at the back and front centres disguise the division in a divided
sports skirt, and only an expert should be able to tell the difference
between this style and an ordinary skirt in wear. For beach wear or cruising,
a wrap skirt with a centre front or side button fastening is an indispensable
item as it may be worn either as part of a suit or over sports shorts and
swimming suit. Many designers feature complete sports suits comprising a
jacket with a wrap-skirt and shorts to match.</p>
<p>Skirt-shorts, as their name denotes, are a combination of shorts and skirt
with the freedom of the former and the appearance of the latter achieved by
the use of pleats and flares. These garments may be made either separately
from the body part or in one piece with an opening down the centre front
fastened with buttons, or, alternatively, cut with a backless bodice and have
buttons down the sideseam to the side plaquet.</p>
<p>Apart from the adoption of the skirt for sports wear, there is little to
be said of its use as part of a costume, excepting, perhaps, the vogue of
wearing a skirt of contrasting hue under a short or three-quarter length
loose-fitting coat.</p>
<p>With regard to the successful cutting of skirts, many of the thoughtless
or hasty thinkers imagine this to be a simple operation. In comparison with
the cutting of a body garment with the need for fitting two opposing surfaces
of the figure form, skirt-cutting may be simple, but only comparatively
so.</p>
<p>The same principles of waist suppression apply to a skirt with equal
force, only the need for providing a covering in harmony with the figure form
is confined to the waist downward to the hips. In the chapter on <a href="lgcm-04.html">Waist
Suppression</a>, the author described the need for curving the waist and hip
balance lines as the garment follows the bending of the trunk from the centre
back round to the sides and front. The reason why waist suppression must be
systematically applied only at the &quot;bends&quot; of the figure was
pointed out, with stress laid upon the fact that suppression at the sideseams
must be only moderate in quantity and the majority of the excess surplus
between the bust, waist and hip measures be reduced from the &quot;bend&quot;
of the figure midway between the sideseam and the centre back.</p>
<p>All these points are applicable to skirt cutting and the author bases his
skirt system upon the knowledge obtained from cutting close-fitting coats.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a name="prelim" id="prelim"></a><em><a href="illust/087.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,562);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/087-t.jpg" alt="Figure 87" width="179" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig87" id="fig87"></a>Preliminary to the Basic Principles of
Skirt Construction (Fig. 87)</h3>
<p>The basis of all skirt systems is the section of the figure from the waist
to the hip level. Width of the hem line is of secondary consideration to the
need for allocating the waist suppression in its correct location to
harmonize with the shape of the figure. Once the waist suppression factor is
decided, the alteration for style reasons of the width at the hem line will
affect this factor only comparatively. For instance, a perfectly
straight-hanging skirt will appear to have a larger quantity of material
taken from the waist darts than a skirt of ample width. The increase is
illusionary, for the proportion of suppression taken out at each section
remains identical in each case.</p>
<p>Fig. 87 (a) illustrates the waist-to-hip section with correct allocation
of waist suppression applicable to the section in the square.</p>
<p>For the purpose of examining the cutting of skirts with an analysis of the
fundamental principles, the following measures are necessary&#8212;</p>
<p>The Waist Measure, taken tightly over the dress or skirt.</p>
<p>The Hip Measure, taken at a point 8 inches below the waist line.</p>
<p>The Skirt Length, at the front, side and back, taken from the waist level
to the desired length.</p>
<p>The following drafts illustrating the principles of skirt cutting are
based upon the following measures&#8212;</p>
    <ul class="small">
      <li>Waist = 25 inches.</li>
	<li>Hips = 38 inches.</li>
	<li>Front length = 27 inches or to fashion.</li>
	<li>Side length = 27&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>Back length = 27&frac12; inches.</li>
    </ul>
<p>In the chapters on coat cutting the author has stressed the point of
suppressing the waist at the sideseam by a standard quantity of &frac34; inch.
This is all that is necessary to agree with the contour of the figure at this
region, as there is no pronounced bend or &quot;round&quot; from the waist
downwards to the hip line.</p>
<p>The back waist suppression is decided as two-thirds of the difference
between the bust and waist measures, and the front suppression as the
remaining one-third. The indentation of the back hollow is far greater in
comparison with the front, and needs twice as much extra created length of
the sideseam at the side waist to enable the garment to follow the bending of
the figure from the centre back to the side and front.</p>
<p>Therefore, when cutting skirts the author adheres to the basic principles
of the allocation and proportions of waist suppression as described for
coats, with the amendment of an additional increase of &frac12; inch to the back
waist quantity as the need for greater suppression at the back waist hollow
becomes apparent with the need for a closer fit to the figure. The closer a
garment is required to be fitted to the figure, the greater will be the
extent to which the waist and hip balance lines will curve, owing to the
increase of suppression taken out.</p>
<p>To construct the draft section from the waist to the hip level as depicted
by Fig. 87 (a)&#8212;</p>
<p>Square from X.</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>1 from X = 8 inches down from the waist for the hip level. </li>
	<li>Square out from these points.</li>
	<li>2 from 1 = the half-hip measure plus &frac12; inch for two seams at the
sideseams.
	  <ul>
	    <li>No addition has been made for ease of any description, as the author
    has found that, for modern skirts, measuring over a dress or skirt gives
	      the necessary amount of freedom and ease throughout the draft. Seams are
	      only
    allowed at the sideseams and at the top of the skirt to simplify cutting
	      when difficult and cut-about designs are required. All additions can then
	      be made
    for any variation of style without affecting the basic construction of the
    skirt draft.</li>
      </ul>
	</li>
	<li>Square up from 2 to 3 to agree with the front construction from X to
1.
	  <ul>
	    <li>The position of the sideseam may be variably placed either at
    exactly half the hips circumference or slightly in advance of this point.
	      For skirts that have the same design at back and front the exact sideseam
    position is correct, while for other styles the sideseam is placed 1 inch
	      in
    advance of the exact half of the hip measure. This is necessary in order
	      to bring the plaquet fastening towards the front. </li>
      </ul>
	</li>
	<li>4 from 1 = half the measure from 1 to 2 less 1 inch.</li>
	<li>Square from 4 to 5 on the waist line.</li>
	<li>Measure up the waist from 3 to 6, adding &frac12; inch for two seams at the
sideseams.
	  <ul>
	    <li>Now, as the suppression at the side waist for coats is 3/8 inch, the
    actual suppression to be taken out of the waist to the hip for a skirt is
	      the 3/8 inch plus the half of the hip overlap which for a normal figure
	      equals
    &frac34; inch. Therefore, the total suppression at the sideseams for the figure
    size as described equals &frac34; inch plus 3/8 inch, 1 1/8 inches in all, and
	      2&frac14; inches taken out completely.</li>
        <li>This amount is decided as one-third of the total waist surplus from
          6 to X, and is indicated by the position of 7 from 6. 7 from 6 is equal
          to
  one-third of 6 to X.</li>
	    <li>The back waist suppression has been decided as two-thirds of the waist
  surplus plus &frac12; inch and is indicated by the position of 8 and 7. 8 from 7
  is equal to two-thirds of 7 to X plus &frac12; inch.</li>
	    <li>The front waist suppression is decided as the remaining third of the
  surplus and is indicated from 8 to X.</li>
	    <li>When the front waist suppression falls below &frac12; inch, the author
  disregards the quantity and reduces a little more accordingly from the
  side-seams to make up the difference.</li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
	<li>9 and 10 from 5 = the side waist suppression, as shown from 6 to 7.
Shape the sideseams from 9 and 10 to the hip point at 4.</li>
	<li>11 from 3 for the position of the first dart from the centre back =
one-sixth of the half-hip measure.</li>
	<li>Square down from 11 to 12.</li>
	<li>13 from 11 for the position of the second dart equals the same
quantity.</li>
	<li>Square down from 13 to 14.</li>
	<li>15 and 16 from 11 = half of the quantity from 7 to 8.</li>
	<li>Shape out the dart from 15 and 16 to 12.</li>
	<li>17 and 18 from 13 = the remaining half of the quantity from 7 to 8.</li>
	<li>Shape out the dart from 17 and 18 to 14.</li>
	<li>19 from 5 = one-sixth of the hip measure for the position of the front
waist dart.</li>
	<li>Square down from 19 to 20.</li>
	<li>21 and 22 from 19 = the quantity as shown from 8 to X.</li>
	<li>Shape out the dart from 21 and 22 to 20.</li>
	</ul>
    <p>Fig. 87 (b) shows the hip section after the darts have been sewn out. The
  curving of the waist and hip balance lines enables the hip section to follow
  the bending of the figure without distortion.</p>
    <h3 class="clear"><a name="curvature" id="curvature"></a><em><a href="illust/088.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,315);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/088-t.jpg" alt="Figure 88" width="120" height="241" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig88" id="fig88"></a>The Extent of the Curvature of
the Balance Lines (Fig. 88)</h3>
  <p>Fig. 88 indicates the extent of the curvature of the waist and hip
balance lines; at the back yoke the curvature is 1&frac14; inches from the waist
line and 2&frac14; inches from the hip line. The front yoke does not show so
great a curving of the balance lines, as from the waist to the hips is
practically a straight line without waist indentation. At the waist line a
curving of &frac12; inch is indicated, and at the hip line the curvature is &frac34;
inch.</p>
<p>To establish a reliable skirt system to give automatic adjustment of the
quantities taken from the waist darts as the width of the skirt increases or
decreases, we must calculate from one extreme to another, that is to say, we
must estimate the quantities of waist suppression in proportion to the
varying skirt widths from the point where the skirt shows no increase of
width from the straight to where the waist shows no suppression to be taken
out in darts and a skirt width in proportion.</p>
<p>Therefore, the system is based upon the hip yoke shape after the darts
have been sewn out, giving a full-width skirt with the extra increase of hem
circumference in the correct locations as decided by the closing out of the
waist darts as shown by Fig. 88.</p>

  <p>Fig. 92 illustrates the draft of a skirt most suitable in width for
present-day design. The width of the hem line as drafted forms the basis upon
which all variations of seams and designs are superimposed in the following
drafts.</p>
	<p>Measures are as for Fig. 91.</p>
	<p>To draft&#8212;</p>
<p>Square from X.</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>1 from X = 8 inches down for the hip level.</li>
	<li>Square out from 1 to 2.</li>
	<li>2 from 1 = the half-hip measure plus &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>3 from 1 = half the distance from 1 to 2 less 1 inch.</li>
	<li>4 from 2 = 1 inch. Join 3 to 4 and square up from 4 to 5 the same

	<li>9 from X = half the distance from X to 7 less 1 inch from X.</li>
	<li>10 from 9 = one-third of the distance from 6 to X.</li>
	<li>Shape the waist level of the top from X to 10 and 7 as shown.</li>
	<li>Line down from 10 to 11 through 3 the side skirt length plus &frac14;
inch.</li>
	<li>12 from 7 = the back skirt length plus &frac14; inch.</li>
	<li>Shape the bottom edge run from 8 to 11 and 12.</li>
	<li>Measure from 7 to 13 half the waist size plus &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>14 from 13 = one-third of the distance from 13 to X.</li>
<li>15 from 14 = two-thirds of the distance from 14 to X plus &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>Suppress the sideseams from 10 to 16 and 17 by the quantity shown from
13 to 14.</li>
	<li>Shape from 16 and 17 to 3 in a gradual run.</li>
	<li>18 from 4 = one-sixth of the half-hip measure for the position of the
first back dart.</li>
	<li>Square down from the waist line to 18 from 19.</li>
	<li>20 and 21 from 19 = half the quantity shown from 14 to 15.</li>
	<li>Shape out the back dart from 20 and 21 to 18, making the dart 7 inches
in length.</li>
	<li>22 from 18 = one-sixth of the half-hip measure.</li>
	<li>Square down from the waist line at 23 to 22.</li>
	<li>24 and 25 from 23 = half the quantity shown from 14 to 15.</li>
	<li>Shape out the back dart from 24 and 25 to 22, making the dart 7 inches
in length.</li>
	<li>26 from 3 = one-sixth of the scale.</li>
	<li>Square down from the waist line to 26 and suppress the front dart by the
quantity shown from 15 to X at 27 and 28.</li>
	<li>Shape out the dart from 27 and 28 to within 2 inches of 26 to complete
the standard draft for skirts.</li>
	</ul>
   <p>For increased width in the hem, point 4 is deviated further from 2, the
distance from 3 to 4 always remaining the same.</p>
	<p>Point 4 cannot be at a greater distance from 2 than half the difference
between the waist and hip measures, otherwise the waist girth would be
smaller than the measure.</p>
	<p>In the drafting of skirts with full-width hems, it will be found, on
measuring up the waist from 7 to 13, that after one-third of the surplus has
been applied, there is nothing left for the back darts. This is a correct
state of affairs, for the increase of width in the hem line takes place at
the back and front of the skirt before the sides are affected, since the
closing out of the back darts gives the extra width from the hip level at the
back to the hem without affecting the sideseams. Only when a very flared
skirt is required is flare added to the sideseams by closing out the side
waist suppression as indicated by the hip section in Fig. 89.</p>

  <p>Fig. 93 illustrates the draft of a panel skirt. This style has perpetual
popularity and is repeated every year in fashion as a basis upon which to
vary design by pleats, flares or fancy and diverted seamings. The draft shows
a skirt with six gores; in some instances, the sideseam may be dispensed with
and the skirt cut with four gores and four panel seams. A straight skirt line
is given by the draft, and, to counteract the effects of perspective upon the
panel seams, they are slightly wider at the hem than at the hip level. If
they were spaced equally all the way down from the hip level to the hem line,
a narrowing effect would be apparent as the panels approached the bottom
edge.</p>
	<p> Measures for the draft are as follows&#8212;</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>Waist = 27 inches.</li>
	<li>Hips = 40 inches.</li>
	<li>Skirt length at front = 28 inches.</li>
	<li>Skirt length at side = 28&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>Skirt length at back = 28&frac12; inches.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>To draft&#8212;</p>
	<p>Square from X.</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>1 from X = 8 inches down for the hip level.</li>
	<li>Square out from 1 to 2 the half-hip measure plus &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>3 from 1 = half the distance from 1 to 2 less 1 inch.</li>
	<li>4 from 2 = 1 inch.</li>
	<li>Join 4 to 3 and square up 8 inches from 4 to 5.</li>
	<li>Square back from 5 to locate 6 in line with points X and 1.</li>
	<li>7 from 5 = one-third of the distance from X to 6.</li>
	<li>7 from 4 = 8 inches.</li>
	<li>Join X to 7 to locate point 8.</li>
	<li>8 from X = half the distance from X to 7 less 1 inch.</li>
	<li>9 from 8 = one-third of the distance from X to 6.</li>
	<li>Shape the waist line of the tops from X to 7 through 9.</li>
	<li>10 from X = the front skirt length plus &frac14; inch.</li>
	<li>Line from 9 through 3 to 11 the side skirt length plus &frac14; inch.</li>
	<li>12 from 7 = the back skirt length plus &frac14; inch.</li>
	<li>Shape the bottom edge run of the skirt from 10 to 11 and 12.</li>
	<li>Measure from 7 to 13 half the waist measurement plus &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>14 from 13 = one-third of the distance from 13 to X.</li>
	<li>15 from 14 = two-thirds of the distance from 14 to X plus &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>17 and 16 from 9 = the quantity shown from 13 to 14.</li>
	<li>Shape out the sideseams from 17 and 16 to 3 at the hip level and
continue down to 11.
	  <ul>
	    <li>The width apart of the back panel seams is a matter of personal
    taste, but it is preferable that the width of the back panel from seam to
    seam does not appear too wide in comparison with the width of the two side
    panels.</li>
        <li>For the best effect, the back panel should be slightly wider than
          the side panels, and so the author calculates as follows. Measure up
          the distance
  from 4 to 3 and double the quantity, which gives the width of the back from
  sideseam to sideseam. Divide the amount registered by three to find the equal
  widths and then subtract 1 inch from each of the two side panels and add to
  the centre panel.</li>
	    <li>For systematic purposes the back panel from 4 to 18 is made equal to
  one-sixth of the half-hip measure plus 1 inch. </li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
	<li>Square down from the waist line at 19 to 18.</li>
	<li>20 and 21 from 19 = half the quantity shown from 14 to 15 plus &frac14;
  inch.</li>
	<li>Shape out the back dart from 20 and 21 to 18.
	  <ul>
	    <li>As a seam is included in the design from 20 and 21 to 18, the
    suppression may be taken to the hip level at 18, for there is not the
    necessity to taper the seam gradually away as in the case of a dart.</li>
      </ul>
	</li>
	<li>22 from 18 for the position of the side dart = 3 inches.</li>
	<li>Square down from 23 on the waist line to 22.</li>
	<li>Suppress at 24 and 25 from 23 the remainder of the quantity registered
  from 14 to 15.</li>
	<li>Shape out the dart from 24 and 25 to 22, making the dart 7 inches in
  length as usual.
      <ul>
        <li>It will be noted that an extra amount has been taken from the first
      back dart. This is advisable when the design has a seam at this point, for
      the suppression can then be gradually tapered to the hip level.</li>
      </ul>
	  </li>
	<li>26 from 1 for the width of the front panel = one-sixth of the half-hip
  measure plus &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>Square down from 27 on the waist line to 26.</li>
	<li>28 and 29 from 27 = the quantity from 15 to X.</li>
	<li>Shape out the front panel seams from 29 and 28 to 26, gradually tapering
  the seam runs.</li>
	<li>The back panel seam at the hem line is made equal in width to the
  distance from 18 to 4 plus &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>Shape from 18 to 30 as shown to complete the back section.</li>
	<li>The width of the front panel seam at the hem is made equal to the
  distance from 26 to 1 plus &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li> Shape from 26 to 31 to complete the front panel seam run.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The widths given are subject to variation as the width of the hem line
increases and, in all cases, are governed by the proportion between the
centre and side panels as described previously.</p>

(Fig. 94)</h3>
  <p>At the present time, the gored skirt with a low-flare effect is very
popular and will in all probability continue so for quite a long while. A
minimum of flare should only be added to each panel if the material used is
tweed of unpliable texture, and not more than 3 inches should be added in any
case for tweed skirts.</p>
<p>For skirts made of silk, linen or otherwise pliable materials the amount
of flare added may be increased up to 5 inches. In all instances the extent
of flare is guided by the design and style tendencies of the moment.</p>

  <p>    Fig. 95 shows the draft of a one-piece wrap skirt. Such skirts are
usually cut the full width of the material, and the wrap-over depends upon
what the difference is between the half-hip measure in comparison with the
width of the material used. A wrap-over of approximately 12 inches is
necessary, and when the hip size is so great that this amount is not
obtainable from the material width, the insertion of a sideseam is then
necessary.</p>
<p>Wrap-over skirts for beach wear usually are cut away under the wrap, just
sufficient being left for a button-stand for fastening, but with a costume
skirt there is no fastening of any description, so that ample wrap is
essential.</p>
<p>Measures are as follows&#8212;</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>Waist = 27 inches.</li>
	<li>Hips = 40 inches.</li>
	<li>Front skirt length = 28 inches.</li>

<p>Square from X.</p>
	<ul class="small">

	<li>Square out from 1 to 2 the half-hip measure plus &frac12; inch.
	  <ul>
	    <li> It is
      necessary to mention that the elimination of the sideseam should mean a
      reduction of the &frac12; inch added for seams from the overall hip quantity, but,
      as this type of skirt depends upon the size round for success, the &frac12; inch
      is added as usual. A skirt without a definite fastening to keep it in place
      always needs to be cut easier to size, otherwise every movement will cause
      a winging-away of the fronts.</li>

	<li>17 and 18 from 5 = the quantity shown from 6 to 7.</li>
	<li>Shape out the side dart from 17 and 18 to 4.
	  <ul>
	    <li>A seam is allowed each side of this dart, but on each of the other
    darts no provision has been made for seams, and the darts are sewn-out in
	      the marks.</li>
      </ul>

	<li>19 from 4 = one-sixth of the half-hip measure.</li>
	<li>Square up from 19 to the waist line.
	  <ul>
	    <li>In this case the point squared coincides with point 6, so, to
    eliminate unnecessary additional figures, the front waist suppression will
	      be taken from each side of point 6. Therefore, shape out the dart from
	      20 and 21
    by the quantity shown from 8 to X to 2 inches above 19.</li>

  <p>  Skirts with high waist-line effects are very fashionable and smart in
wear for they accentuate the height and slender appearance of the wearer and
permit the wearing of a belt, either of leather or of the same material as
the skirt or blouse. The extent the waist line is raised from the natural
position should never exceed 3 inches as, after this distance, the figure
commences to increase in girth rapidly to the bust, and consequently there is
need for increase of circumference at the skirt top.</p>

Construction (Fig. 98)</h3>
  <p>    Fig. 98 illustrates an example of skirt construction with a hip yoke
cut in one with the panels, instead of being a separate factor. The skirt
panels have a slightly flared effect at the hem line, and, for the purpose of
designs where the back and front panels are required to be of equal shape and
size, the side-seam is placed exactly in the centre of the draft; otherwise
with the sideseam in the usual position, the widths of the panels would
necessarily be of unequal proportions.</p>

  <p>Fig. 99 illustrates the draft of a new style of sports skirt, the
trouser-skirt. This garment, as its name implies, is a combination of a skirt
with a trouser-leg effect. For a successful trouser-skirt, there must be
ample ease of stride room for walking so that the fact of the garment being
bifurcated is not too apparent.</p>
	<p>Pleats are usually inserted at the centre back and front to disguise the
break of the legs and, in the making, should be stitched down to below the
fork level. The most important point to keep in mind is the need for ample
fork width to give ease of movement, otherwise the trouser-skirt is based
upon the standard skirt basis with additional overall ease.</p>
	<p>To eliminate a centre front seam down the fronts from the waist line, a
short hip yoke is included in the design at back and front.</p>
	<p>Full measures are as follows&#8212;</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>Waist = 25 inches.</li>
	<li>Hips = 38 inches.</li>
	<li>Front and back skirt length = 27 inches.</li>
	</ul>
<p>An additional measure to be taken is the height of the body-rise. This is
taken with the wearer seated upon a chair and measured from the seat level to
the position in the waist line where the skirt is required to be worn. For an
average figure, the height of the body-rise varies from 11 to 12&frac12; inches.
In this instance, a rise of 11&frac12; inches is taken.</p>

  <p>    The addition of pleats at the front and back centre seams is
illustrated by Fig. 100. The success of a divided trouser-skirt depends
mainly upon the pleats set in at the centre front and back, without which the
garment would bear no resemblance to a skirt and appear as a widely-cut pair
of short trousers! The pleats are actually inserted where the fork seam
commences to curve under the body, and in wear resemble inverted pleats. The
pattern is now cut through down the centre front from the point where the
front yoke terminates at point 43, and a quantity of 8 inches is let in to
form one-half of the pleat. Fig. 100 shows how this takes place, and the top
of the pleat is shaped to a point to enable it to be sewn in with the yoke
seam. The pleat is folded back from 43 to 43 and 15 to 15, and a good plan is
to edge-stitch the folds of the pleat to stop them from coming out of shape.
After both sides of the fronts have been treated as above, the fork seam from
43 to 16 is then sewn together, and the two edges of the pleats as indicated
by line 43 to 15 are sewn together for a depth of approximately 6 inches or
to just below the commencement of the leg seam.</p>
	<p>The front yoke dart is closed out from 37 to 38 and 44 (Fig. 99) and is
shown in the finished position ready for adding a seam from 41 to 42 and 43.
A seam is also added to the skirt from 41 to 42 and 43.</p>
	<p>The back skirt is treated in a similar manner to the front; the back
waist darts from 28 and 32 to 27 and 31 respectively are shown in a
closed-out position ready for the addition of seams, and 4 inches have been
added to form the back centre pleat from 39 to 20. This pleat is folded over
and sewn together in exactly the same way as the front, and, when the skirt
is finished, no suspicion of a break in the skirt front or back should be
apparent. The skirt should fit and hang as well as an ordinary skirt. The
fork shape and length from front to back gives the necessary ease for walking
and movement generally.</p>

Pleats (Fig. 101)</h3>
  <p>Fig. 101 shows the draft of a plain costume skirt with a front panel

  <h3 class="clear"><a name="cutting" id="cutting"></a><em><a href="illust/102.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,377);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/102-t.jpg" alt="Figure 102" width="119" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig102" id="fig102"></a>Cutting Pleats from the Material
(Fig. 102)</h3>
  <p>Fig. 102 shows the usual method adopted for cutting inverted pleats from
the material. Fig. 102 (A) illustrates the front panels with the additions
for the pleat placed together to form a whole front piece. The centre front
of the skirt is placed to the fold of the material and the whole section cut
out in one piece, after allowing seams round each panel seam.</p>
	<p>This method may prove to be expensive with regard to the length of
material used, and an alternative method of cutting inverted pleats is shown
by Fig. 102 (B). In this instance, the addition for the pleat is made
unequally as indicated, with three-quarters of the pleat added to the side
panel and the other quarter added to the front panel, the pleat being sewn
together at the fold. By adding the pleat in this way, it is possible to vary
the layout of the pattern when cutting from the material to a greater extent
than is possible with the first example. The seam of the pleat need not
necessarily be placed in the fold on the front panel; it may be transferred
to the fold of the side panel from 38 to 39, but in no instance must the seam
be placed down the centre of the pleat, as it will show in wear.</p>
	<h3 class="clear"><a name="shorts" id="shorts"></a><em><a href="illust/103.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,399);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/103-t.jpg" alt="Figure 103" width="126" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig103" id="fig103"></a>The Shorts-skirt (Fig. 103)</h3>
  <p>The shorts-skirt has become very popular in tennis circles as a garment
that gives the freedom of shorts with the grace of a skirt. As in the
trouser-skirt, pleats at the centre back and front hide the fork seam, and
additional pleats at the side of the back and front give a graceful
appearance and freedom of movement.</p>
	<p>Rightly, as these garments are only suitable for the young and slender,
the draft is arranged to agree with the following measures&#8212;</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>Waist = 25 inches.</li>
	<li>Hips = 36 inches.</li>
	<li>Body-rise = 11 inches.</li>
	<li>Sideseam length = 17&frac12; inches.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>To draft&#8212;</p>
	<p>Square from X.</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>1 from X = the hip level = 8 inches below the waist.</li>

	<li>3 from 2 = 1 inch.</li>
	<li>4 from 1 = half the distance from 1 to 2 less 1 inch.</li>
	<li>Join 4 to 3 and by this line square up from 3 to 5 the distance from 1
to X, i.e. 8 inches.</li>
	Square from 5 to locate 6 in line with points X and
1.
<li>Join X to 5 to locate point 7.</li>
	<li>7 from 5 = one-third of the distance from X to 6.</li>
	<li>8 from X = half the distance from X to 7 less 1 inch from X.</li>
	<li>9 from 8 = one-third of the distance from X to 6.</li>
	<li>Shape the waist line from X to 9 and 7.</li>
	<li>Continue the construction line from X to 1 to 10, the length of the
body-rise, i.e. 11 inches.</li>
	<li>Continue down to 11 from X, the full length of the shorts, i.e. 17&frac12;
inches plus a &frac14; inch seam.</li>
	<li>12 from 10 = &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>Line through from X to 12 and 13 equal to the distance from X to 10 and
11.</li>
	<li>By line X to 13, square out from 12 to 14 one-sixth of the half-hip
measure plus &frac12; inch.</li>

equal to 10 from X.</li>
	<li>17 from 7 = the length from X to 11.</li>
	<li>18 from 16 = &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>Line from 7 through 18 to 19 equal to the length from 7 to 17.</li>
	By line 7 to 19, square from 18 to 21 the distance from 12 to 14 plus 2&frac12; inches.
<li>20 from 19 = the distance from 18 to 21 plus &frac14; inch.</li>
	<li>21 from 20 = the distance from 18 to 19.</li>
	<li>Shape the back fork seam from 7 to 21, hollowing the seam to within 2&frac12; inches of point 18.</li>
	<li>Shape the inside leg from 20 to 21.</li>
	<li>Square out from 1 to 2 the half-hip measurement plus 2 inches.</li>

suppression.</li>
	<li>The quantity from 24 to 25 is the back waist suppression.</li>
	<li>The quantity from 25 to X is the front waist suppression.</li>
	<li>26 from 7 = 4 inches for the position of the first back waist dart and
position of the back pleat.</li>
	<li>27 from 26 = 3 inches for the position of the second back waist
dart.</li>
	<li>Reduce at points 26 and 27 the quantity shown from 24 to 25 in equal
parts.</li>
	<li>Shape out the back waist darts from 26 and 27 to 28 and 29, these darts
to be 4&frac12; inches in length and squared down from the line joining 7 to
9.</li>
	<li>The position of the front waist dart and pleat is 3&frac12; inches from
X.</li>
	<li>Suppress at 30 the quantity shown from 25 to X.</li>
	<li>Shape out the front waist dart, the length of the dart to be 4&frac12;
inches, and square down from the line joining X to 9.</li>

    <h3 class="clear"><a name="provision" id="provision"></a><em><a href="illust/104.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',453,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/104-t.jpg" alt="Figure 104" width="240" height="130" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig104" id="fig104"></a>Provision for Pleats (Fig.
104)</h3>
  <p>The front skirt is illustrated by Fig. 104 (A).</p>
	<p>The pattern is opened up from X to 13, and an addition of 6 inches is
inserted  from X to 13 for half of the front inverted pleat, as illustrated
by the diagram as from XA to X and 13A to 13.</p>
	<p>Split the pattern through from 24 to 31 and square down to the hem, and
then insert 4 inches for the side knife pleats as shown from 24 to 24A and
from 31 to 31A.</p>
	<p>The front pleat is sewn down to the fork level and the side knife pleats
to a level commensurate with giving the maximum amount of freedom in wear. As
an approximate guide a distance of 8 inches is usual.</p>
	<p>Fig. 104 (B) illustrates the addition of pleats at the back skirt. The
pattern is opened up from 7 to 19 and a quantity of 6 inches is inserted for
the back inverted pleat as illustrated by the diagram.</p>
	<p>From 26 to 29 and square down to the hem line, open up the back skirt
pattern and insert 4 inches for the back knife pleat as shown.</p>
	<p>The shorts-skirt may be cut without a sideseam by overlapping the
sideseams two seams from 34 to 35 and then sharing out the sideseam dart from
33 and 32 to 34.</p>
	<p>This sideseam dart may be left in whole without cutting out to preserve a
clean finish inside the shorts, and only on the left side for the placquet
should it be cut out.</p>
	<p>If the placquet is to be finished with a zip fastener to be concealed
from sight, an addition to the side-seams of 3/8 inch for lapping over the
zip will be required and carried down the sideseams at the back and front to
the length of the zip fastener that is used. With a single zip fastening, the
shortest length of zip is 8 to 9 inches, while if two zips are used a length
of 7 inches is usually sufficient.</p>
	<p>This garment is different in construction from ordinary shorts, owing to
the necessity for obtaining a straight-hanging front and back with the
addition of the fork section considered as a separate entirety. When cutting
shorts, we have to consider the factor of allowance for movement and the fork
section all in one with the body part without a hip yoke to achieve the waist
shape of the figure.</p>
	<p>All shorts-skirts are based upon the system as described, each garment
being considered firstly as a skirt and then the requisite quantity of fork
size being added as a supplement to the constructional basis. Shorts-skirts
are intended to hang straight from the waist loosely over the hips and
resemble a flared and pleated skirt in wear. Shorts are cut closer in fit and
consequently require allowance for ease of movement in a different degree
from the shorts-skirts, but, even so, they do not require the excessive
quantity of material over the hips for stooping that is usually allowed. We
have to submit to misguided and uninformed members of the general public
writing to the daily Press and deploring the fact that the modern girl will
wear garments totally unsuited to the feminine form, whereas the fault lies
with the badly cut and designed shorts which are worn. The fault is due to a
lack of knowledge of cutting these garments, and also the retention of
out-of-date cutting methods. The modern woman has a figure that bears no
comparison with that of her predecessors, and the framers of systems
calculating on an increase of 7 inches in size between the bust and hip
measures are liable to be slightly out of proportion when adapting their
systems to the contours of the typical modern woman. But as the experience of
the author is with cutting for the modern figure and modern designs, he feels
justified in refusing to agree with methods that may have thirty years' or so
experience behind them, and, in the majority of cases, the methods are really
thirty years old and have received very little modernizing. He has found
amongst cutters a reluctance to accept new ideas at their birth; they prefer
to stick to their well-tried methods, and fail to move with progress until
designs have progressed still further.</p>
	<p>Many cutters use a breeches system for drafting trousers or shorts. But
breeches are worn for a special purpose and consequently require specialized
cutting, whereas shorts and trousers are worn when the figure is in a normal
attitude. That was the fault with the early shorts and trousers in wear; they
were constructed on a breeches system owing to the lack of knowledge
available regarding the cutting of these garments.</p>

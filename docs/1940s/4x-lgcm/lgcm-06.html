</p>
  <p>  THERE are standard designs of tailored costumes that do not vary, year in and
  year out, excepting for seasonal changes in length of coat or skirt or width
  at the hem line. These costumes have earned the title of &quot;classical&quot; in
  the trade, due no doubt to the unending popularity of these styles over the
  more &quot;effervescent&quot; modes that live and die in one season. We have
  a similar parallel in music, the tunes that live for a moment and the &quot;classical&quot; melodies
  for which there are always adherents.</p>
  <p>
  Women are attracted by the volatile in fashion, yet the &quot;well-dressed&quot; appeal
  of a costume is an unfailing antidote to the more &quot;dressy&quot; styles
  if they are unsuited to the wearer. Tailored garments always have a warm place
  in the hearts of English women, for their type is suited to the trim, refined
  appearance of a well-cut suit as no other women in the world.</p>
  <p>
  A well-known woman explorer and globe-trotter once wrote: &quot;Into a room
  full of beautiful women clothed in gorgeous gowns, nonchalantly strolled an
  Englishwoman clad in a tailored suit bearing the unmistakable imprint of Bond
  Street cut and 'line.' Amid a murmur of approval she was acclaimed as the best-dressed
  woman in the room.&quot; Yet it could only be a comparison of types. The Englishwoman
  looks her best in clothes of conservative design, where, in similar circumstances,
  women of any other nationality would look quite inconspicuous.</p>
  <p>
  At any time of the year and especially in the Spring, a tailored suit is the
  essence of <em>chic</em>, made in a way only possible by English tailors and
  tailoresses. The standard designs are few in number yet of undiminishing popularity
  in
  vogue. In a world of constantly changing fashion we do know the coming style
  in tailored suits will be very little different from that of the past.</p>
  <p>
  Panelled jackets with either single- or double-breasted fronts are perhaps
  most in demand; the slimming effect of this design ensures its continued success.
  Next, we have the sidebody jacket sometimes with a centre seam at the back
  or, alternatively, a back cut on the fold of the material. A link-button front
  often accompanies this style, cut away sharply or straight-fronted, thus emulating
  a man's dinner jacket. Jeatted pockets, slanting or straight, may terminate
  a seam from the shoulder or a waist dart under the bust. A &quot;lounge&quot; style
  cut on masculine lines is adaptable to sportswear and severely tailored designs
  with the accompaniment of suitable
  restraint in the accessories worn.</p>
  <p>
  Each season sees variation in the &quot;run&quot; of seams and the length of
  the jacket&#8212;very infinitesimal variation perhaps, but the reader of the
  most informative of fashion periodicals keeps <em>au fait</em> with the changes. Panel
  seams may break off from their destination at the shoulder and be diverted
  into the back of the armhole for a square-shoulder effect, or, to gain an impression
  of smoothness over the shoulders and achieve a sloping-shoulder effect, the &quot;drop-shoulder&quot; line
  may be utilized. Points of design to break up the straight line of a seam or
  as an aid to a slim effect do not change the generally static design of costume
  jackets, so that in applying the system to the drafting of tailored styles
  we need only attend to the interpretation of designs always in vogue.</p>
  <p>
  When interpreting the following designs, the system will be based upon varying
  measures and figures to illustrate more clearly, if necessary, the working
  in practice. A degree of ease in fit will be in accordance with the requirements
  of the majority of women; it would be futile to base systems on the exaggeratedly
  close fit that a minority of women desire.</p><p>
  The &quot;plastered&quot; look may suit a woman of very good figure, but, on
  the whole, the attainment of a shapely garment without strain should be our
  aim. A few months ago the public were treated to an announcement of a new material
  that promised no more badly fitting garments. But the point was that in order
  to produce a good fit, the garment had to be cut too small! Otherwise with
  bad cutting the same faults would be ever apparent.</p>
  <p>
  If a very close-fitting garment is required by the client, a reduction of the
  addition to the bust size for ease and seams by &frac12; inch will make the
  necessary difference throughout the system.</p>

    Jacket (Fig. 33)</h3>
  <p>
    The link-fronted jacket with panel seams at back and front is generally accepted
  as one of the most fashionable and neat designs worn. Peaked lapels are an
  attribute of style, culminating in a gracefully cut-away front below the single
  link button. Jeatted pockets set on the straight are shown, with a waist dart
  above terminating under the bust prominence.</p>
  <p> For the purpose of refreshing the memory, the system as applied to this
    design will be based upon the normal 34-inch bust basis; in succeeding styles
    the system will be applied to larger and smaller figures based upon actual
    measurements
  to which the author has cut. </p>
  <p>To draft the link-fronted jacket the following
  are the measures necessary&#8212;</p>
  <ul class="small">
    <li>

    Cut-away Jacket (Fig. 34)</h3>
  <p>A single-breasted jacket style with panel seams at back and front converging
  into the scye forms the subject of the following draft. The fronts are sharply
    cut away from the single-button fastening to the bottom edge, jeatted pockets
    on the hips follow the run of
  the fronts, and another method of transposing the shoulder dart to another
  seam is described.</p>
  <p>
  This type of design with curving seams as a feature is very flattering and
  suitable to the slender figure, by giving an illusion of curves and rounded
  shape.</p><p>
  For the purpose of the draft, a figure of 32-inch bust measurement has been
  chosen. Complete measures are as follows&#8212;</p>
  <ul class="small">
    <li>
    Chest = 30 inches.</li>
    <li> Bust = 32 inches.</li>
    <li> Waist = 24 inches.</li>
    <li> Hips = 36 inches.</li>
    <li> Natural waist length = 14&frac12; inches.</li>
    <li> Full length = 22&frac12; inches.</li>
    <li>Half-back width = 6&frac14; inches.</li>
    <li> Sleeve length = 28 inches.</li>
    <li> Working scale = half the bust measure = 16 inches.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  To draft&#8212;</p>
  <p>Commence by drawing line X to X, the full length of the jacket,
    22&frac12; inches.</p>
  <ul class="small">
    <li>
    1 from X = one-third of the scale plus 1&frac34; inches.</li>
    <li> 2 from X = the natural waist length = 14&frac12; inches.</li>
    <li> X from 2 is the position of the actual hip line, 8 inches below the
    waist line.</li>
    <li> 3 from X = one-sixth of the scale less &frac14; inch.</li>
    <li> 4 from 3 = 1 inch. Shape from 4 to X for the back
  neck run.</li>
    <li> 5 from 1 = the half-back width plus &frac14; inch.</li>
    <li> 7 from 1 = half the bust measure plus 2 inches.</li>
    <li> 8 from 7 = from X to 1 at the back.</li>
    <li> 9 from 8 = one-twelfth of the scale.</li>
    <li> 10 from 9 = one-sixth of the scale.</li>
    <li> 11 from 7 = half the scale less &frac34; inch.</li>

    <li> Square up from 12 to 13 equal to 7 to 9 less &frac12; inch.</li>
    <li> 14 is midway of the scye at 5 to 11.</li>
    <li> Square up from 14 to 15 one-third of the scale plus
  &frac14; inch.</li>
    <li> Join 15 to 4 and 15 to 13. </li>
    <li>Point 16 is located where line 15 to 4 is
        intersected by
  line 5 to 6.</li>
    <li> 17 from 16 = &frac12; inch. Shape the back shoulder as
  indicated.</li>
    <li> 18 from 13 = 4 to 17 less &frac12; inch.</li>
    <li> Complete the shape of the scye as illustrated by the draft. </li>
    <li>Square from
      7 to 19 and 20 for the centre line. </li>
    <li>Square down from 14 to 21 and 22.        </li>
    <li>Suppress &frac34;
          inch at the sideseams at 21 to 23 and 24,
  3/8 inch each side. </li>
    <li>Overlap at the hips half the difference between the bust

    <li> 28 from 1 = 3&frac34; inches.</li>
    <li> 29 from 2 = 3 inches.</li>
    <li> 30 from X = 3&frac14; inches.</li>
    <li> Shape the curved panel seam from 27, 28, 29 to 30 at the bottom edge.</li>
    <li> 31 from 2 = half the waist measure plus 2&frac34; inches. The tight skirt
      waist measure of 24 inches has 2 inches added before being applied to the
      draft.</li>
    <li> 32 from 28 = &frac12; inch.</li>
    <li> 33 from 29 = two-thirds of the difference shown at 31
  to 19.</li>
    <li> 34 from 30 = &frac14; inch.</li>
    <li> Shape the panel seam from 27, 32, 33 and 34.</li>
    <li> 35 is midway 11 to 7.</li>
    <li> 36 from 19 = 3&frac14; inches.</li>
    <li> 37 from 20 = 3 inches.</li>
    <li> 38 from 11 = the same distance 27 is from 5. </li>
    <li>Shape the front panel
        from 38, 35, 36 to 37. </li>
    <li>Sweep from 13 to 39, pivoting from point 35.</li>
    <li> 39 from 13 = 13 to 10.
      <ul>
        <li> The bust dart is then closed out until point 39

    Jacket (Fig. 35)</h3>
  <p> A standard sidebody design is illustrated by the draft shown in Fig. 35.
    The fronts are single-breasted with single-breasted revers and fasten with
    either two or three
  buttons. A seam-back is shown and at the front a shoulder dart takes the place
  of the panel seam for providing contour shape for the bust. Jeatted pockets
  at the hip are set on the slant with a waist dart above for additional shapeliness.</p>

  <p>Fig. 36 shows the &quot;lounge&quot; basis system in practice. The design
    chosen for the purpose of illustrating how the system works has single-breasted
    fronts, cut straight
  and fastening with one link-button, single-breasted revers with the bust dart
    transferred to under the lapel and a back without a centre seam. The sideseam
    position
  is similar to that of the masculine &quot;lounge,&quot; and a dart takes the
  place of the customary underarm seam.</p>
  <p>
  It is not advisable to use this basis draft for figures of larger hip increase
  over the bust size than the proportionate 4 inches, for provision for the hip
  girth cannot be adequately applied without a sidebody seam or panel back.</p><p>

  THE SLEEVE DRAFT</h5>
  <p>
  An open pointed cuff is the feature of the sleeve chosen to harmonize with
  this design of jacket. Another interesting point is the displacement of the
  forearm seam from the elbow to the wrist instead of a complete three-quarter
  sleeve finish, the necessity of stretching the forearm seam in the hollow of
  the elbow thereby being avoided.</p>

  Panel Jacket (Fig. 37)</h3>
  <p>
    The double-breasted panel jacket is the most popular of all tailored jackets
  and gives a well-dressed appearance on all occasions. A slender effect may
  be achieved by narrow spacing of the panels and a narrow button spacing, or
  slender lapels, whilst an appearance of width and wide shoulders can be infused
  by judicious seam runs and bold lapels. It is not advisable to space the buttons
  too far apart, as this tends to give a widening appearance to the waist which
  is contrary to the general slender effect at which we are aiming.</p>
  <p>
  For the purpose of this draft, a figure of full bust and hip development has
  been chosen. The full measures are as follows&#8212;</p>
  <ul class="small">
    <li>
    Chest = 34 inches.</li>
    <li> Bust = 38 inches.</li>
    <li> Waist = 30 inches.</li>
    <li> Hips = 42 inches.</li>
    <li> Natural waist length = 15&frac12; inches.</li>
    <li> Full length = 24 inches.</li>
    <li> Half-back width = 7 inches.</li>
    <li> Sleeve length = 30 inches.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  The proportionate bust girth to agree with a chest measure of 34 inches is
  36 inches. Therefore, the working scale for the back depth and width factors
  equals half the bust size, i.e. 18 inches.</p>
  <p>
  The scale for the front depth and width factors equals one-third of the 38
  inches bust measurement plus 6 inches, i.e. approximately 18&frac34; inches.</p>
  <p>
  To draft&#8212;</p>
  <p>Commence by drawing X to X, the full length of the jacket.</p>
  <ul class="small">
    <li>
    1 from X = the back depth = one-third of the scale
  (18 inches) plus 1&frac34; inches.</li>
    <li> 2 from X = the natural waist length = 15&frac12; inches.</li>

  <p>
  Now we come to an interesting point. The normal hip size for a proportionate
  36-inch bust figure is 40 inches, so an increase of 2 inches is noted which
  indicates a prominent development of the hips at the side and back.</p>
  <p>
  When the hip girth is 4 inches larger than the breast, the basis draft gives
  an overlap of 1&frac12; inches at the sideseams and &frac14; inch suppression at the
    back panel seam. When the figure has a prominent bust, however, we have to
    take
  into account the reduction of size at the front panel under the bust to remove
  the extra material which has been added to the front width for accommodation
  of the increase in bust prominence.</p>
  <p>
  Compare the hip size with a proportionate 4 inches of increase to calculate
  the amount to be added or reduced, and then add to this quantity the amount
  reduced from the front panel seams.</p>
  <p>
  To the normal across-chest width of 8 &frac14; inches for a 36-inch bust an extra
    &frac34; inch has been added, and half of this quantity is reduced from the front
    panel
  at the waist and hips in accordance with the basis system draft.</p>
  <p>
  In the case of this draft, the hip size is proportionate with the increase
  in the breast prominence, so the hip overlap at the sideseam remains at 1 &frac12;
    inches plus the quantity taken from the front panel seam.</p>
  <p>
  Sideseam overlap = half the difference between breast and hip measurements
  less &frac12; inch, plus half of the increase across the breast width = 1&frac12;
    inch, plus 3/8 inch = 1 7/8 inches.</p>
  <ul class="small">
    <li>
    27 from 24 = 1 inch.</li>
    <li> 28 from 24 = 7/8 inch. Shape the sideseams from 15 to 25
  and 28 and from 15 to 26 and 27.</li>
    <li> 29 from 2 = the half-waist measurement after 2 inches
  have been added, plus 2&frac34; inches and the &frac34; inch added at the fronts,
  3&frac12; inches in all.</li>
    <li> 30 from 5 = 3&frac12; inches for the commencement of the
  back panel seam.</li>
    <li> 31 from 1 = 4&frac34; inches.</li>
    <li> 32 from 2 = 4 inches.</li>
    <li> 33 from 3 = &frac12; inch more than 32 to 2.</li>
    <li> Shape the back panel seam from 30 to 31, 32, 33 and the bottom edge.</li>
    <li> 34 from 31 = &frac12; inch.</li>
    <li> 35 from 32 = two-thirds of the waist surplus 29 to 20.</li>
    <li> 36 from 33 = &frac14; inch.</li>
    <li> Shape the panel seam from 30 to 34, 35, 36 and the bottom edge.</li>
    <li> 37 is midway 12 to 8.</li>
    <li> 38 from 37 = 2 inches for the point of bust prominence.</li>
    <li> 39 from 20 = 4 inches.</li>
    <li> 40 from 21 = 4 inches.</li>
    <li> 41 from 40 = 3/8 inch, i.e. half the increase in the across-bust width
    over the normal.</li>
    <li> 42 from 39 = 3/8 inch or half the front width increase of
  &frac34; inch.</li>
    <li> 43 from 14 = &frac12; inch for the position of the front panel
  seam.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  It is advisable to keep the front panel seam towards the neck point with full-breasted
  figures from the point of view of style, as a wide spacing of the seams from
  the bust to the shoulders would tend to create an impression of greater width
  at the bust.</p>
  <ul class="small">
    <li>
    44 from 43 = 14 to 11, pivoting from point 38.</li>
    <li> Shape the front panel seams from 43 to 38, 39 and 40, and from 44 to
    38, 42, 41 and the bottom edge.</li>
    <li> Take the remainder of the waist surplus from the front dart at 45.</li>
    <li> Add on 3&frac12; inches at 46 down the fronts for the double-breasted
      overlap.</li>
    <li> 47 from 22 = &frac34; inch. Shape the bottom edge run from
  47 to the front sideseam below 27.</li>
    <li> 48 from 10 = one-sixth of the scale (18&frac34; inches). Shape
  the neck curve from 48 to 11.</li>
    <li> 49 from 11 = 1 inch. Mark the crease line of the lapels
  from 49 to 46.</li>
    <li> Square down from 11 equal to 1&frac12; inches. Then line from this point
    through 48 to 50.</li>
    <li> 50 from 48 = 1 inch.</li>
    <li> 51 from 50 = 2&frac12; inches. Complete the shape of the
  lapels as shown.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  The buttons are spaced 5&frac12; inches apart, which is quite wide enough for
    a jacket style, and should not be exceeded.</p>

  At the back there is a yoke across the shoulders from sleeve pitch to pitch.
  Four waist darts take the place of panel or sidebody seams in confining the
  garment to the figure, and an all-round belt is included. Patch pockets are
  usually of detailed design, with box or inverted pleats to give amplitude of

  <p>    Fig. 40 is valuable as a lesson on applying waist suppression to a design
      varying from the panel or sidebody styles. The diagram illustrates a smart
      short jacket,
  with ultra-heavy lapels and a strap collar and panel seams from the shoulders
  to the waist, thence slanting to the sideseams at the hips. A welt pocket may
  be inset in the front panel seam, and the front dart at the waist should be
  decreased in length to 6 inches.</p><p>
  The draft is arranged to the following measures&#8212;</p>
  <ul class="small">
    <li>
    Chest = 34 inches.</li>
    <li> Bust = 36 inches.</li>
    <li> Waist = 28 inches.</li>
    <li> Hips = 39 inches.</li>
    <li> Natural waist length = 15 inches.</li>

    <li> Working scale = half the bust girth = 18 inches.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Commence by drawing line X to X, the full length of the jacket.</p>
  <ul class="small">
    <li>
    1 from X = the back depth = one-third of the scale
  plus 1&frac34; inches.</li>
    <li> 2 from X = the natural waist length = 15 inches.
      <ul>

  equal to 7 to 9 less &frac12; inch. </li>
    <li>14 is midway of 5 to 11. Square up to 15 one-third
    of
  the scale plus &frac14; inch. </li>
    <li>Join 15 to 4 and 15 to 13.</li>
    <li> 16 is located where the line from 15 to 4 is intersected by
  the line from 5 to 6.</li>
    <li> 17 from 16 = &frac12; inch. Shape the back shoulder seam from 17 to 4.</li>
    <li> 18 from 13 = 17 to 4 less &frac12; inch. </li>
    <li>Complete the shape of the scye
    as shown.</li>
    <li> Square down the front centre line from 7 to 19 and 20.</li>

    <li> Suppress at 23 and 24 from 21 3/8 inch each side.</li>
    <li> Overlap at the hips from 22 to 25 and 26 half the difference between
    the bust and hip measures less &frac12; inch.</li>
    <li> Shape the sideseams from 14 to 24 and 25 and from 14 to 23 and 26.</li>
    <li> 27 from 2 = half the waist measure plus 2&frac34; inches.</li>
    <li> 28 from 4 = 3&frac14; inches for the position of the back panel
  seam at the shoulder.</li>
    <li> 29 from 1 = 4&frac12; inches.</li>
    <li> 30 from 2 = the desired width apart of the panel seams
  at the back before they slant to the sideseams&#8212;in this instance, one-sixth
  of the scale plus &frac12; inch = 3&frac12; inches.</li>
    <li> 31 from X = 2 to 30 plus &frac12; inch.</li>
    <li> 32 from 29 = &frac12; inch.</li>

    <li> Shape the panel seam from 28, 32, 33, to 36 and the sideseam at 35.</li>
    <li> Shape from 28 to 29, 30 and 37.
      <ul>
        <li> As the hip section below the panel seam is required to be all in
          one piece, the waist suppression is taken out by laying the back sections
          together
          from
        36 and 34 to 37 and 31 as shown by the lower diagrams.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  When cutting fancy designs, the essential suppressions are marked on the draft
  first, and then the design is superimposed on the draft as the suppressions
  permit. In most instances, it is possible to manipulate the pattern to harmonize
    with the design, as will be shown in the chapter dealing with Style Reading
  and Designing by Block Patterns.</p>

        45 the remaining third of the waist surplus.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  Sometimes a straighter-fitting effect is required at the fronts, and this dart
  may be omitted without detracting greatly from the fitting standpoint.</p>
  <ul class="small">
    <li>
    Add on &frac34; inch at the front edge from 19 to 46.</li>

  <h3><a name="basque" id="basque"></a>Basque Manipulation</h3>
  <p> The lower diagrams illustrate how the suppressions are closed out to enable
  the basque to be cut whole. These diagrams also show how the waist seam becomes
  curved when suppression is infused.</p>
  <p>
  If more flare is required in the basque, this is obtained by opening out the
  pattern at the lines marked and letting in at the hip the estimated amount
  of increase in size.</p>
  <h3 class="clear">
  <em><a href="illust/042.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,421);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/042-t.jpg" alt="Figure 42" width="133" height="188" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig42" id="fig42"></a>Fig. 42</h3>
  <p>
  Fig. 42 shows how the increase is brought about. The pattern is split up at
  two other points at 1 to 2 and 3 to 4 to obtain a gradual curve to the waist
  seam and even distribution of the increased flare.</p>
  <p>
  Recent styles of &quot;dressy&quot; jackets have been seen with exaggerated
  flared basque effects. For general purposes it is not advisable to open the
  pattern out more than 1 inch at each of the three points of manipulation.</p>
  <p>
  Similarly at the front section, the pattern is opened in a like manner at two
  other points, 5 to 6 and 7 to 8.</p><p>
  Even distribution of the flare is achieved by a gradual curve to the waist
  seam. Occasionally, however, the flare is required to show at definite points
  instead. In this case the waist seam is not curved but cut to the shape obtained
  by opening the pattern, that is, with the waist seam angulated as shown by
  Fig. 42 (B).</p>

  Shape the dart 7 inches in length at an angle as illustrated. </p>
  <p>
  The slanting pocket mouth is made 6 inches in length on the hips.</p>
  <p>
  The outside breast welt pocket is made from 3&frac12; to 4 inches in length.</p>
  <p>
  The gorge dart is sewn-out in the marks as indicated, or, if cut, provision
  must be made for two seams.</p>
  <p>
  The centre back seam is sewn-out in the marked line, and the back vent commences
  at 3 inches below the waist line and is made 1&frac12; inches in width.</p>
  <p>
  Sew the underarm dart a &frac14; inch seam inside the marks, as seams are
  allowed at this seam position in the basis system, while the actual sideseams
  from
  13 to 16 on the back and 13 to 54 and 56 at the front require seams to be added
  when the material is being cut.</p>
  <p>
  The front breast dart is sewn-out in the indicated marks.</p><p>
  A point to remember for riding coats is to take the back width on the loose
  side as plenty of provision for the forward position of the arms must be made.</p><p>
  The lounge riding coat draft is now completed, and the next draft will take
  the form of a panel-back riding jacket, with the panel seam emanating from
  the back scye pitch to converge narrowly towards the centre back in the waist.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><a name="panelled" id="panelled"></a><em><a href="illust/044.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,479);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/044-t.jpg" alt="Figure 44" width="153" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig44" id="fig44"></a>Panelled Riding Jacket Draft (Fig. 44)</h3>
  <p>    Another very popular style of riding jacket is the single-breasted panelled-back
    coat with a centre back seam and slit. This style buttons at the front with
    two
  holes and buttons, and is then rather gradually cut away to the bottom edge.</p>
  <p>
  Single-breasted lapels and slanting pockets are practically universal for riding
    garments, and this style is not an exception to this rule, for a single-breasted
    lapel looks more
  conservative in wear for any sports garments and is to be preferred to the
  peaked double-breasted lapel.</p>
  <p>
  A sideseam is placed under the scye and there is a front breast dart for additional
  shaping to the figure. The spring over the hips is obtained by estimating the
  hip overlap to be greater than the proportionate and actual size. For instance,
  the breeches worn with this garment are cut very much fuller at the thigh and
  seat than the actual measures, and when a lounge riding coat to be worn over
  the breeches is cut, the shape and size of the coat skirt will be required
  to be cut to approximately the increased hip size of the breeches. Therefore,
  if the breeches have 4 inches or so allowed over the half-hip measure for ease,
  seams and sideseam spring, then the coat will require a similar greater addition
  to the allowance for seams and ease, etc. The author calculates the hip size
  to be approximately 3 inches greater on the draft than the actual measured
  girth for the additional sideseam skirt spring, and then, in the distribution
  of the extra material, calculates on the draft for prominence of hips by placing
  two-thirds at the sideseams and one-third on the panel seams.</p>
  <p>
  Measures for the draft are as follows&#8212;</p>
  <ul class="small">
    <li>
    Chest = 36 inches.</li>
    <li> Bust = 38 inches.</li>
    <li> Waist = 30 inches increased to 32 inches for ease.</li>
    <li> Hips = 41 inches increased to 44 inches for the drafting
  of the sideseam spring provision. </li>
    <li>Natural waist length = 15&frac14; inches.</li>
    <li> Full coat length = 28&frac12; inches. </li>
    <li>Half-back width = 7 inches.</li>
    <li> Working scale = one-third of the bust girth plus 6 inches = 18&frac34;
      inches.</li>

      10 to 11 on the line squared out from X. </li>
    <li>12 from 1 = the half-bust measure
          plus 2 inches.        </li>
    <li>Square up from 12 to 13. </li>

    <li>Join 24 to 23 for the gorge dart
    allowance.</li>
    <li> The sideseam is located at 25 half the distance from 10
  to 18. </li>
    <li>Square down from 25 to 26, 27 and 28 on the lines
  squared out from 2, 3 and 4.</li>
    <li> 29 from 25 = one-third of the scale plus &frac14; inch. </li>
    <li>Join 29 to 9 and

    <li> 30 is located where the line joining 29 to 9 is intersected
  by the line from 11 to 10.</li>
    <li> 31 from 30 = &frac12; inch.</li>
    <li> Shape the back shoulder seam from 31 to 9 as shown. </li>
    <li>Measure up the width
        of the front shoulder seam from 20
  to 32 equal to the distance from 31 to 9 less &frac12; inch. </li>
    <li>Shape the front shoulder
    seam from 32 to 20. </li>
    <li>Shape the scye from 32 to 25 and 31, hollowing &frac12; inch
        in
  front of the scye construction line from 18.
      <ul>
        <li>The position of the back pitch, which also
      decides the position of the back-panel seam
      commencement, equals half the back depth up
      from 10 to 33.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li> 34 from 6 = one-third of the scale less 1 inch.</li>
    <li> 35 from 5 = 6 to 34 less 1&frac12; inches.</li>

      <ul>
        <li> The back suppression quantity is indicated by the amount from 38
          to 39, i.e. two-thirds of the total surplus from 38 to 15. The front
          waist
          suppression

  indicated from 38 to 39 less the centre back suppression from 2 to 5. 
      <ul>
        <li>The hip
        overlap is calculated as follows: for a proportionate increase of 4 inches
        in the hip measure over the bust size, 1&frac12; inches overlap is added
          at the sideseams. The hip measure for this draft shows an increase
          for normal
          proportions of
        2&frac12; or 1&frac14; inches on the draft. Two-thirds of this increase is placed
          at the sideseams and one-third at the panel seams. The sideseam overlap
          becomes
          2&frac14; inches instead of 1&frac12; inches, and the back panel seams are
          overlapped &frac12;

    <li>Overlap at the hips
        2&frac14; inches, as previously stated, from

    <li>Shape the front sideseam from 25 to 44, 47 and 49 and
  the back sideseam from 25 to 45, 46 and 48. </li>
    <li>50 from 17 = 1 inch. </li>
    <li>Join 50 to
    49 for the bottom edge run.
      <ul>
        <li> The top button is located at 51, 2 inches above
      the waist line and 1&frac12; inches out from the centre
      line for the single-breasted front edge. </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Shape the front edge run from 51 to
    the bottom edge
  run as shown.</li>
    <li> 53 from 14 = one-sixth of the scale. </li>
    <li>Shape from 53 to 54 and from 54
        to 55, making 54 from

    <li> Join 56 to 55 and shape the gorge run from 55 to 24. </li>
    <li>52 from 20 = 1
        inch for the collar stand width. </li>
    <li>Mark the crease line of the lapels from
          51 to 52, breaking
  at the gorge dart as described previously. </li>
    <li>Shape the lapels from 51 to 57 3
    inches from 50. </li>
    <li>Mark the front waist dart at 58, reducing in the suppression
      the quantity shown from 39 to 15. </li>
    <li>Mark the dart 7 inches in length and
        machine out in the
  marks.
      <ul>
        <li> The pocket is 12 inches down from the breast
      line and 6 inches in length, being placed two-thirds
      forward from a vertical line squared down from
      18 and one-third back. </li>
        <li>The back vent at 59 is commenced at 3 inches
        below the waist line, to complete the riding jacket
        draft.</li>

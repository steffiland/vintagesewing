  <p>THERE is a saying in the trade at the moment that &quot;the sleeve makes
the dress.&quot; Of recent designs this is certainly true, for sleeves have
had the attention of designers concentrated upon them exclusively to the end
of added interest in the design as a whole.</p>
<p>It is certainly true that the addition of an intricate sleeve to a dress
minimizes the need for a great deal of design in the body part, and so we
have pouched, pleated, gathered and leg-of-mutton sleeves featured with
recent dress styles.</p>
<p>The majority of intricate sleeve designs can be evolved from a basic
one-piece sleeve pattern with manipulation, though in the majority of
instances it is practically impossible to obtain a sleeve pattern by straight
drafting. A certain amount of cutting about of the basic pattern is necessary
before the desired result is achieved.</p>
<p>Dress sleeves are based upon the same principles as coat sleeves, with
amendment to the draft for the requirements of the smaller armhole, and
consequent less quantity of fullness in the sleeve crown in addition to the
general narrower cut in the sleeve width at the elbow and cuff.</p>
<p>From the basic one- and two-piece sleeve patterns, any sleeve design with
darts, pleats or pouched effects can be cut in a few moments providing the
basic principles of manipulating and cutting about of the outline pattern are
thoroughly understood. So the author will show the basic drafts for one- and
two-piece sleeves in their outline form and illustrate how to cut the many
sleeve design variations in vogue at the moment.</p>

    <p>The draft of the scye is as follows, based upon a 36-inch bust
size.</p>
<p>To draft&#8212;</p>
<p>Square lines from X.</p>
    <ul class="small">
      <li>1 from X = the back depth = one-third of the scale plus 1&frac12;
inches.</li>
	<li>2 from X = the natural waist length = 15&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>3 from X = the back neck width = one-sixth of the scale less &frac14;
inch.</li>
	<li>4 from 3 = the back neck height = &frac34; inch.</li>
	<li>Shape the back neck curve from 4 to X as shown.</li>
	<li>5 from 1 = the half-back width.</li>
	<li>Square up from 5 to 6 on the line from X.</li>
	<li>Square out from 1 to 7 half the bust measure plus 1 inch.</li>
	<li>Square up and down from 7 to 8 and 9.</li>
	<li>10 from 8 = one-twelfth of the scale.</li>
	<li>Square back from 10 to 11 one-sixth of the scale.</li>
	<li>The across-chest width from 12 to 7 = half the scale less 1 inch.</li>
	<li>13 from 12 = one-sixth of the scale less &frac14; inch.</li>
	<li>Square up from 13 to 14 equal to the distance from 7 to 10 less &frac12;
inch.</li>
	<li>15 from 6 = 1 inch.</li>
	<li>Square out from 15 to 16 &frac14; inch, and shape the back shoulder seam from
16 to 4.</li>
	<li>17 from 14 = the front shoulder width equal to the back shoulder width
less &frac14; inch.</li>
	<li>18 from 17 = 1 inch. Shape the front shoulder seam from 18 to 14.</li>
	<li>Shape the scye from 18 to 19 and 16, hollowing &frac14; inch in advance of
the line from 12 to the line from X to 8.</li>
	<li>19 is located at half the distance from 1 to 7.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The front sleeve pitch is located at A, &frac34; inch up from the base of the
scye line at 12.</p>
<p>The back pitch B is located at half the back depth from X to 1 up from
5.</p>
<p>The following measures derived from the scye outline are
necessary&#8212;</p>
<p>(1) The height of the back sleeve pitch from the breast line to calculate
the base of sleeve depth.</p>
<p>(2) The sleeve crown height, derived from the position of the shoulder
seams in their relation to the height of the back pitch from the breast line
after they have been sewn together.</p>
<p>(3) The circumference measure round the top-scye from the front pitch A to
the shoulder end at 18 and from the back shoulder end at 16 to the back pitch
B.</p>
<p>(4) The circumference measure of the under-scye,  measured from the back
pitch B round the under-scye to 19 and the front pitch A.</p>
<p>(5) The total scye circumference, combining the top- and under-scye
measures.</p>
<p>(6) The full sleeve length, measured either from the centre back to the
elbow and wrist or alternatively from the sleeve seam at the shoulder end to
the wrist over the forearm.</p>
<p>These days dress sleeves are worn very long instead of the normal length,
to crease over the hand at the wrist and to act as a safeguard to the sleeve
shortening up the arm in wear, which is a fault in tightly-fitting dress
sleeves.</p>

(b))</h3>
<p>Fig. 125 (b) illustrates the one-piece sleeve draft. The following
measures are derived from the scye&#8212;</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>The back pitch height from the breast line = 3&frac34; inches.</li>
	<li>The crown height = 1&frac14; inches.</li>
	<li>The top-scye circumference = 8&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>The under-scye circumference = 7&frac14; inches.</li>
	<li>The total scye circumference = 15&frac34; inches.</li>
	<li>The sleeve length from the centre back to wrist = 29 inches.</li>
	</ul>
<p>To draft&#8212;</p>
<p>Square lines from X.</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>1 from X = the height of the pitch B from the breast line in Fig. 125
(a).</li>
	<li>2 from 1 = &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>3 from 2 = the top-scye circumference applied diagonally less &frac12;
inch.</li>
	<li>4 from 3 = one-third of the distance from 2 to 3 plus &frac34; inch.</li>
	<li>5 from 4 = the crown height = 1&frac14; inches.</li>
	<li>6 is located at midway of X to 4.</li>
	<li>Shape the sleeve crown from 2 to 6, 5 and 3.</li>
	<li>Square down from 4 to 7 the full sleeve length applied diagonally from 3
to 7 less the width of the halfback measure.</li>
	<li>8 from 7 = &frac34; inch. Square each way from this point at right angles
with the line from 4 to 7.</li>
	<li>The width of the sleeve at the wrist for an average 36-inch bust woman
should be approximately 8 inches, so to systematize the cuff width it is
calculated as half the total scye circumference.</li>
	<li>Therefore 9 from 8 = one-eighth of the total scye circumference.</li>
	<li>10 from 8 = one-eighth of the total scye circumference.</li>
	<li>11 from 9 = &frac14; inch.</li>
	<li>12 from 10 = &frac14; inch. Shape from 11 through 8 to 12.</li>
	<li>13 from 11 = one-third of the distance from 11 to 12.</li>
	<li>Measure round the under-scye from the front pitch A to the underseam at
19 in Fig. 125 (a) and apply this quantity from 2 to locate point 14 on the
line squared out from 1.</li>
	<li>By line 2 to 11, square across from 14 to 15, making 2 to 14 equal to 2
to 15.</li>
	<li>By line 2 to 11, square across from 13 to 16, making 16 to 9 equal to 13
to 9.</li>
	<li>Shape from 2 to 15 and from 11 to 16 and join 15 to 16 for the underseam
of the sleeve.</li>
	<li>Measure up the under-scye from the back pitch B round the scye to 19 in
Fig. 125 (a) and apply this quantity from 3 direct to locate point 17 on the
line squared from 1 to 14.</li>
	<li>Join 3 to 12 and by this line square across from 17 to 18 and 19.</li>
	<li>19 from 18 = 18 to 17.</li>
	<li>Shape the under-sleeve shape from 3 to 19 as shown.</li>
	<li>By line 3 to 10, square across from 13 to 20, making 13 to 10 equal to
10 to 20.</li>
	<li>Shape the sleeve cuff from 12 to 20 to complete the sleeve draft.</li>

<h3><a name="onesleeve" id="onesleeve"></a>One-piece Sleeve (Fig. 126
(b))</h3>
    <p>Fig. 126 (b) illustrates the draft of a one-piece sleeve for dresses,
with the seam at the forearm instead of at the underarm.</p>
<p>This sleeve is very suitable for cutting pouched effects at the hindarm,
as it is cut on the fold of the material at this section.</p>
<p>The scye measures are derived from Fig. 125, and are as follows&#8212;</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>The back pitch height from the breast line = 3&frac34; inches.</li>
	<li>The crown height = 1&frac14; inches.</li>

	<li>Apply the under-scye circumference measure from 1 to locate point 6.</li>
	<li>7 is midway of 6 to 2 to ensure that the hindarm line from 7 is exactly
midway of the full width of the sleeve.</li>
	<li>Square up from 7 to locate point 8 on the crown of the sleeve</li>
	<li>Square down from 1 to 9 the full sleeve length, less the width of the
half-back measure, applied diagonally from 2 to 9.</li>

	<li>Shape from 1 to 17 and 8 for the under-sleeve seam run.
	  <ul>
	    <li>Fig. 126 (c) illustrates the shape of the sleeve when opened
    out.</li>
        <li>An increase of width in the sleeve may be achieved as shown by the
          dash line in Fig. 126 (b) in which the hindarm line from 8 to 16 is
          widened 2
  inches to locate point 18.</li>

    <p>Raglan sleeves for dresses are deservedly popular at the moment, for
they are definitely possessed of greater style value than the plain set-in
sleeve, in addition to their ability to harmonize with practically any bodice
or skirt design. Though the raglan sleeve with the overarm seam is not used
to a great extent, it is always advisable to adhere to the shoulder
construction embodying a dart from the neck to the shoulder end in preference
to the shoulder construction giving a whole raglan shoulder sleeve without
the dart.</p>
<p>The shoulder section of Fig. 127 is constructed to agree with the
measurements in accordance with the proportions of a 36-inch bust figure, and
the working scale is 18 inches.</p>
<p>To draft&#8212;</p>

	<li>24 from 14 = 1 inch. This quantity is variable and dependent upon the
design of the dress. In some instances, the width of the raglan sleeve horn
is wider than others, while, at other times, the seams run away to
practically nothing at the neck.
	  <ul>
	    <li>In this draft, the author has arranged for the raglan sleeve seams
    to be 1 inch apart when finished. The advantages of facilitating making-up
    are deciding factors in the width advocated.</li>
        <li>As 24 is located on the line from 14 to 13, the bust dart intersects
          the raglan shoulder seam, and this must be taken into account so that,
          when the
  bust dart is sewn out, the raglan seam continues in a similar run to that
  marked from 24 to the front pitch A.</li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
	<li>Join 24 to the pitch A, and shape the seam from 24 to A, adding &frac12; inch
of run to the seam between these points.</li>
	<li>25 from 11 = the distance 24 is from 14, i.e. 1 inch.</li>
	<li>26 is located where the construction line from 24 to A intersects the
line of the bust dart from 21 to 22.</li>
	<li>27 is located where the seam from 24 to A intersects the same bust dart
line.</li>
	<li>Therefore, to reproduce the shape of the raglan shoulder seam, allowing
for the bust dart through the shoulder, square across from 26 to 28 and 27 to
29.</li>
	<li>28 from 21 = the same length as 21 to 26.</li>
	<li>29 from 21 = the same length as 21 to 27 to ensure that when the bust
dart is sewn out, 26 will agree with 28 and 27 with 29, making the raglan
shoulder seam run from 25 to 29, 27 and A continuous.</li>
	<li>Join 25 to 28 and shape the shoulder seam from 25 to 29.</li>
	<li>30 = half the distance from 25 to 11.
	  <ul>
	    <li>The raglan shoulder construction allows the back sleeve horn to be
    &frac12; inch in width to agree with the width of the front sleeve horn from
    25 to 30.</li>
        <li>The reduction of 1 inch from the front shoulder ensures the centre
          seam of the raglan shoulder being placed exactly on the top of the
          shoulder at
  30.</li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
	<li>The back pitch B is located at half the back depth, from X to 1, up from
point 5.</li>
	<li>Square back from point B to 31&frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>Join 31 to 4 and add &frac12; inch of curve to the raglan shoulder seam
between these points.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>It is advisable to keep the back width for a raglan style rather on the
narrow side; otherwise, there is a tendency for the sleeve to cause creases
at the back of the armhole when the arm is at the side. The author prefers to
think of raglan sleeves as a part of the bodice instead of a separate
entirety, and to systematize the construction on a magyar sleeve basis,
varying the seam runs irrespective of the outline of the normal scye.
Individuality of design is not achieved by adhering to the set outlines of
conventional ideas, but by courageously departing from the stereotyped lines
and drafting our seams to obtain the artistic appreciation of good style and
line.</p>
<p>To do this we must always think of the sleeve and bodice as a whole and
add to one the quantity taken from the other.</p>

128)</h3>
    <p>For the object of illustrating the construction of the raglan sleeve
shoulders, a one-piece sleeve basis draft has been adopted. The
constructional points described are equally applicable to any other type of
sleeve, so it is unnecessary to describe more than the application of the
systematic principles to one type of sleeve.</p>
<p>The method of constructing the raglan horns on the one-piece sleeve base
is the principle of measuring the shape of the displaced sections of the
shoulders and applying these quantities to the sleeve head to obtain the
shape of the raglan shoulders on the sleeve in a similar manner to cutting
away the shoulder sections and laying them in position on the sleeve head as
described in Chapter VIII (Fig. 57). If an intricate shoulder seam design is
intended, it is necessary to cut the shoulder sections from the body part and
then lay in position on the sleeve draft in a similar way to the cutting of
drop-shoulder line sleeves.</p>
<p>The scye measurements are as follows&#8212;</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>The height of the back pitch from the breast line = 3&frac34; inches</li>
	<li>The crown height = 1&frac14; inches</li>
	<li>The top-scye circumference = 8&frac12; inches</li>
	<li>The under-scye circumference = 7&frac14; inches</li>
	<li>The total scye circumference = 15&frac34; inches</li>
	<li>The sleeve length from the centre back to the wrist = 29 inches</li>
	</ul>
<p>To draft&#8212;</p>
<p>Square lines from X.</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>1 from X = the back pitch height from the breast line less &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>2 from 1 = &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>Square out from X and 2.</li>
	<li>3 from 1 diagonally = the top-scye circumference less &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>4 from 3 = one-third of the distance from 1 to 3 plus &frac34; inch.</li>
	<li>5 from 4 = the crown height = 1&frac14; inches.</li>
	<li>6 is midway of X to 4.</li>
	<li>Shape the sleeve head of the normal sleeve from 1 to 6, 5 and 3 as
indicated by the dash lines.</li>
	<li>Square down from 4 to 7 the full sleeve length applied from 3 to 7, less
the width of the half-back measure.</li>
	<li>Square across from 7 to 8 &frac34; inch.</li>
	<li>9 from 8 and 10 from 8 together equal one-fourth of the total scye
circumference.</li>
	<li>Join 9 to 1.</li>
	<li>11 from 9 and 12 from 10 are each respectively &frac14; inch.</li>
	<li>Shape the cuff run from 11 to 12.</li>
	<li>Measure round the under-scye from the front pitch A to the underarm seam
at 19 in Fig. 127 and apply this quantity from point 1 to 13 on the line
squared out from 2.</li>
	<li>Measure round the back-scye from the back pitch B to the underarm seam
at 19 in Fig. 127, and apply this quantity from point 3 direct to 14 plus &frac12;
inch for ease.</li>
	<li>The position of the underarm of the sleeve is located at 15, one-third
of the distance from 12 to 11 from 11.</li>
	<li>By line 1 to 9, square across from 15 to 16, making 16 from 11 equal to
11 to 15.</li>
	<li>Shape from 16 to 11.</li>
	<li>By line 1 to 9, square across from 13 to 17, making 17 from 2 equal to
13 from 2.</li>
	<li>Shape from 17 to 1 for the underseam of the sleeve from the front pitch
to the sideseam.</li>
	<li>Square down from 3 to locate point 18. 18 is squared from 12.</li>
	<li>18 to 19 = 18 to 12.</li>
	<li>By line 3 to 18, square across from 15 to 20, making the distance from
20 to 18 equal to the distance from 18 to 15.</li>
	<li>21 from 18 = 8 inches for the wrist dart.</li>
	<li>Shape from 12 and 19 to 21 for the dart and from 19 to 20 for the
completion of the cuff shape.</li>
	<li>By line 3 to 18, square across from 14 to 22 and 23, making 23 from 22
equal to 22 to 14.</li>
	<li>Shape the hindarm seam run from 23 to 20.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The construction of the raglan shoulders is as follows&#8212;</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>Measure the distance from the front pitch A to 26 plus 28 to 25 on the
front shoulder in Fig. 127, and apply this quantity in a sweep from 1 to
strike an arc at 24.</li>
	<li>Then measure the width of the front shoulder seam from 18 to 22 plus 14
to 11 in Fig. 127, and sweep this quantity in an arc from point 5 to
intersect the arc from 1 at point 25.
	  <ul>
	    <li>Now, as the length of the raglan shoulder seam has been taken from A
	      to 27, 29 and 25 in Fig. 127, the width of the sleeve horn from 25 to
	      30 must be
    applied from 25 to 26 in Fig. 128 in an upward direction on the sweep from
	      5 to 25, because the triangle formed by the distances from 5 to 25 and
	      1 on the
    sleeve corresponds with the triangle on the shoulder formed by the distances
    from A to 25 and 18 in Fig. 127.</li>
      </ul>
	</li>
	<li>Therefore, mark from 25 to 26 on the sweep from 5 equal to the distance
from 25 to 30 on the shoulder section.</li>
	</ul>
<p>Similarly, if the point 25 were lower than 1 inch from the neck point, the
measurements taken and applied as above would give an accurate shape of the
front shoulder section for adapting to the sleeve head.</p>
<p>The back sleeve horn is constructed in a like manner.</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>Measure the distance on the back shoulder from the back pitch B to 4 in
Fig. 127, and apply this quantity in a sweep from 3 to strike an arc at
27.</li>
	<li>Measure the width of the back shoulder seam from 16 to 4 in Fig. 127 and
sweep this quantity in an arc to intersect the arc 27 at 28.</li>
	<li>The triangle formed by the distances from B to 4 and 16 on the back
shoulder is represented on the sleeve by the triangle formed by the distances
from 3 to 28 and 29.</li>
	<li>Therefore, as there is the width of the back sleeve horn to take into
account as represented by the distance from 11 to 30 at the front shoulder in
Fig. 127, the addition of this quantity must be made in the direction of 29
from 28 on the shoulder width arc from 5 to 28.</li>
	<li>The reduction of the back width from B to 31 in Fig. 127 is transposed
to the sleeve from 3 to 30.</li>
	<li>30 from 3 = B to 31 on the back.</li>
	<li>Join 30 to 28 and hollow the seam between these points to agree with the
run of the seam between 31 and 4 on the back shoulder in Fig. 127.</li>
	<li>Join 1 to 25 and hollow the seam to agree with the seam run from A to
27, 29 and 25 in Fig. 127.</li>
	<li>Shape the shoulder dart from 26 and 29 to point 4, hollowing &frac12; inch at
point 5.</li>
	<li>Shape the underseam run of the sleeve from 30 to 23 to complete the
sleeve draft.</li>
	</ul>
<p>In the event of a seam being required over the arm from the shoulder in
true raglan style, the shoulder dart seams will be continued down the sleeve
on the construction line from 4 to 8.</p>
<p>It is necessary to allow seams when sewing out the shoulder dart from 26
and 29 to 4; also, when the seams are continued down the sleeve, provision
must be made.</p>
<p>When shaping the raglan seam runs on the front and back shoulders it is
not advisable to add too much curve to the seams. They should be shaped to
curve inside the prominence of the shoulder bone in the front; for, if the
seam is curved over the prominence, a constriction on the shoulder will be
felt and the sleeve will drag badly over the muscle as the arm is moved
forward.</p>

    <p>Sharing the popularity of the raglan sleeve is the drop-shoulder line
sleeve. As the name indicates, the shoulder sleeve seam is lowered from its
usual position to further over the arm on the sleeve, and, in some instances,
the normal sleeve seam over the shoulder is dispensed with altogether and the
sleeve and body part cut completely in one piece. The drop-shoulder line
sleeve allows many variations of design to be interpreted; the
sloping-shoulder effect may be achieved or, alternatively, the seam run of
the lowered shoulder line may suggest a square appearance to the
shoulders.</p>
<p>The principle of cutting away the shoulder sections and superimposing them
on the normal set-in sleeve pattern is identical in principle with the
cutting of raglan sleeves.</p>
<p> For the purpose of illustrating the drafting of the drop-shoulder line
and reconstruction of the sleeve to agree with the lowered shoulder, a design
has been chosen that embodies a square-cut front and back yoke with the need
for the yoke seams on the shoulders to run over the arm and for a similar
design on the sleeve.</p>
<p> Measurements for the shoulder section draft in Fig. 129 are based upon a
normal 36-inch bust figure.</p>

in Fig. 129 and apply this quantity plus &frac12; inch from 3 to locate point 14
on the line squared out from 2.</li>
	<li>The position of the under-sleeve seam at the wrist is located at 15,
one-third of the distance from 12 to 11 from 12.</li>
	<li>By line 1 to 12, square across from 15 to 16, making 16 from 12 equal to

	<li>Join 3 to 11.</li>
	<li>By line 3 to 11, square across from 15 to 18, making 18 from 10 equal to

	<li>By line 3 to 11, square across from 14 to 19, making 19 from the line 3
to 11 equal to the distance 14 is from this line.</li>
	<li>Shape the under-sleeve seam from 3 to 19 as shown and complete the
standard sleeve draft by joining 19 to 18.</li>
	<li>To reconstruct the sleeve to form the continuation of the front and back
shoulder yokes over the sleeve, take the front yoke which has already been
cut away from the bodice and place into position on the sleeve head as
shown.</li>
	<li>Firstly measure from the front pitch A on the front scye to 27 in Fig.
129, and apply this quantity plus &frac12; inch for sleeve ease from 1 to 27 on
the sleeve draft.
	  <ul>
	    <li>The addition of &frac12; inch for ease is essential for a perfectly
    hanging sleeve; then lay the front yoke in position so that 27 on the yoke
    agrees with 27 on the sleeve head. The front shoulder end at 18 touches the
    sleeve crown, seam to seam, as shown by the single point indicated by 18.</li>
        <li>Next, take the back shoulder yoke and lay into position on the sleeve
  crown. In this instance, the back pitch B in Fig. 129 is the seam
  commencement of the yoke and therefore is laid in position on point 3. The
  back shoulder end at 16 touches the sleeve crown as shown at point 16. Shape
  out the shoulder dart from 11 to 18 and 4 to 16 to terminate at 4.</li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
	<li>Shape the continuation of the shoulder yoke over the sleeve from 27 to
20, 21, 22, 23, and 3, making the shape of the sleeve yoke agree with the
shape of the back and front shoulder yokes.</li>
	<li>Cut away the shoulder section from the sleeve and, when cutting from the
material, add seams to the sleeve from 27 to 20, 21, 22 and 23 to 3 in
addition to all round the sleeve.</li>
	</ul>
<p>The preceding method illustrates the general principle of interpreting
drop-shoulder and similar shoulder lines with attendant sleeve
reconstruction. It is not essential always to take the shoulder seams over
the sleeve; in the example described, the shoulder yokes at the back and
front could be cut in one piece with the entire sleeve without the
over-sleeve continuation.</p>
<h3><a name="intricate" id="intricate"></a>Intricate Sleeve Designs</h3>
    <p>The following style diagrams will illustrate how to cut many examples
of intricate sleeve designs, in addition to showing the methods adopted for
interpreting designs to harmonize with the requirements of waist suppression.
The designs chosen will have undoubted style value, for they will illustrate
important style features of recurring interest. The tendency to choose styles
of which there are no features that present technical difficulty will be
avoided as far as possible; and each design will, in addition to showing
intricacy of sleeve cutting, enhance general cutting knowledge by extending
the principles of cutting to a wider range and scope.</p>

Pattern for the Wrist Fullness (Fig. 133)</h3>
    <p>The sleeve basis outline requires manipulation to provide for the
extra width of cuff to pouch over the wrist. Fig. 133 indicates the raglan
sleeve outline as drafted by the system illustrated by Fig. 132.</p>
<p>To add the extra width of cuff proportionately round the sleeve, take the
pattern and mark from point 4 squarely down to the cuff at A. A is the centre
of the cuff. By pivoting from point 4, open out the sleeve pattern so that
points B and C are each 2 to 3 inches from A, depending on the amount of
fullness required at the cuff. This operation reconstructs the sleeve pattern
as points 17A, 16A, 19A, and 18A.</p>
<p>The sleeve should be gathered into a narrow wrist band about 8 inches in
length and 1 inch in width. The wrist band may be either finished as a tie or
fastened with press-studs or a buttonhole.</p>

Fullness (Fig. 134)</h3>
    <p>The bodice pattern is manipulated to produce the draped effect as
follows. Cut the bodice part away from the pattern round point 49, 64, 65,
66, 27, 39, 40 and 36, and then close out the bust dart from 65 to 66,
pivoting from 40 as shown.</p>
<p>The pattern is then wedged up from two points between 36 and 49, pivoting
from between 65 and 64, and is opened out the required amount of fullness,
which is 3 inches in this example.</p>
<p>The reconstructed pattern is illustrated by points 64A and 49A. The
fullness should be gathered evenly into the yoke seam both on top and
underneath, and for the edge finish an inlay should be added down from 64A to
49A.</p>

Line (Fig. 135)</h3>
    <p>The smart dress illustrated by Fig. 135 has a unique shoulder line and
sleeve cut. The sleeve is inserted at the shoulder in the shape of a square
yoke, forming a square opening at the back and front neck, with darts across
the yoke from the neck opening to the shoulder end, giving fullness in the
upper sleeve from the shoulder to the elbow. Below the elbow to the wrist,
the extra sleeve width is gathered into a shaped cuff to form a pouched
effect at the hindarm.</p>
<p>The dress has a wrap-over front fastening with two buttons, and a pointed
hip yoke on the skirt at the front to terminate the continuation of the high
bodice waist seam from the back waist. The design gives a good illustration
of how to achieve back waist suppression without the aid of either panel or
across-waist seams. A slight flare is added to the centre front and sideseams
to give walking room, and as an average the width of the skirt at the hem
line should in all instances be 1&frac12; yards or more.</p>

<p>After the scye measurements have been ascertained for the purpose of
drafting out the sleeve, the back and front shoulder yokes should be cut away
from the bodice in the lines from 66 to 64 and 58 and from 55 to 54.</p>
<p>A seam is placed across the waist from 9 to 33 and the front waist
suppression is closed out by cutting through the pattern from the front waist
dart at 45 down to 46 and closing the edges of the waist dart together.</p>
<p>Above the waist line, the waist suppression is closed out in a similar
manner,by closing the two edges of the dart together at 45 pivoting from
44.</p>
<p>The manipulation of the back waist suppression is as follows. Cut out the
side waist section from 48 to 38 and 49, then split up the pattern from 37
and 38 to 42 and 39.</p>
<p>Close out the back waist dart from 37 to 38, by pivoting from 39 and

<p>The yoke sections of the bodice are cut away from the shoulders and now
placed in position on the sleeve head.</p>
<p>It is essential to have ease in the sleeve for a good-hanging sleeve;
therefore, the position where the shoulder yoke is placed on the sleeve head
is decided by the need for a slight amount of ease in the sleeve from the
front pitch A in Fig. 135 to where the yoke is joined to the sleeve head.</p>
<p>Measure round the front scye from the front pitch A to the termination of
the shoulder yoke seam from 64 to 66 at the scye, and apply this quantity
round the sleeve head from 1 to 24 plus &frac12; inch to &frac34; inch for ease.</p>
<p>Then place the front shoulder section in position on the sleeve head by
placing point 66 in Fig. 135 to agree with point 24 and points 65 and 21 to
run with the shape of the    sleeve crown as indicated.</p>
<p>Measure from the back pitch B to the yoke at 55 in Fig. 135 and apply this
quantity from 3 to 55 on the sleeve head as indicated. Place the back
shoulder yoke section in position on the sleeve head so that 55 and 19 run
with the sleeve crown.</p>

(Fig. 139)</h3>
    <p>A summer dress is depicted by Fig. 139, and style notes are as
follows: The skirt is very plain in character with a back waist dart to
achieve suppression, and, in the front skirt, a pocket is inserted in a seam
running squarely from the waist to the sideseams above the hip level. An
inverted pleat gives walking room to an otherwise plain, tight-fitting skirt.
The bodice has a drop-shoulder effect with a centre-front opening fastened
with buttons, while, at the back, the drop-shoulder line terminates in a
point in the centre.</p>
<p>The draft is based upon measurements disproportionate in size to normal,
for in this instance the hip circumference is smaller than the bust girth
after the 1 inch for ease has been added. Therefore the draft must be based
on the bust circumference; otherwise an overlapping of the sideseams at the
bust level would be needed.</p>
<p>Measures for the draft are as follows&#8212;</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>Chest = 32 inches.</li>
	<li>Bust = 34 inches (normal), increased to 37 inches for the
disproportionate increase of bust girth.</li>
	<li>Waist = 28 inches, increased to 31 inches for the draft.</li>
	<li>Hips = 37 inches.</li>
	<li>Natural waist length =15 inches.</li>
	<li>Full dress length = 43 inches.</li>
	<li>Half-back width = 6&frac14; inches.</li>
	<li>Full sleeve length = 28 inches.</li>
	<li>Working scale = half the bust girth (normal = 34 inches) for the back
section, and one-third of the bust girth (37 inches) plus 6 inches for the
front shoulder section to allow for the increase of length needed to cover
the additional bust prominence.</li>
	<li>Scale for the back =17 inches.</li>
	<li>Scale for the front = 18&frac12; inches.</li>
	</ul>
<p>To draft&#8212;</p>
<p>Commence by drawing line from X to X, equal to the full dress length, i.e.
45 inches.</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>1 from X = the back depth = one-third of the scale (17 inches) plus 1&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>2 from X = the natural waist length = 15 inches.</li>
	<li>3 from 2 = the hip level = 8 inches below the waist line.</li>
	<li>4 from X = the back neck width = one-sixth of the scale (17 inches) less
&frac14; inch.</li>
	<li>5 from 4 = the height of the back neck curve = &frac34; inch.</li>
	<li>Shape the back neck curve from 5 to X.</li>
	<li>6 from 1 = the half-back width.</li>
	<li>Square up from 6 to locate point 7 on the line squared out from X.
	  <ul>
	    <li>All the above divisions of the working scale are derived from the
    17-inch scale.</li>
      </ul>
	</li>
	<li>8 from 1 = half the bust girth, 37 inches, plus 1 inch.</li>
	<li>Square down from 8 to locate points 9, 10 and 11.</li>
	<li>12 from 8 = one-third of the front shoulder scale (18&frac12; inches) plus 1&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>13 from 12 = one-twelfth of the scale (18&frac12; inches).</li>
	<li>14 from 13 = one-sixth of the scale (18&frac12; inches).</li>
	</ul>
<p>Now we come to the across-chest width and the need for a
disproportionately greater increase of width than that required for a
proportionate woman with a 37-inch bust.</p>
<p>As the normal bust girth for a woman measuring 32 inches over the actual
chest should be 34 inches, if there is an apparent increase of size to 37
inches this does not mean that the increase is proportionately distributed,
otherwise the back width and chest circumference would also show an increase.
So, when the chest measure is disproportionately smaller than the bust
circumference, we can safely infer that the increase of girth is from the
sideseams forward across the bust. The increase is not placed to the front in
its entirety, however. If the author thinks that the normal across-chest
width for a 37-inch bust figure is inadequate, he adds two-thirds of the
difference between the across-chest widths for normal 34-inch and 37-inch
bust circumferences to this quantity.</p>
<p>Therefore, the across-chest width for a normal 34-inch bust girth is 7&frac12;
inches, and the normal across-chest width for a 37-inch bust circumference is
one-fourth of the bust girth less 1 inch, i.e. 8&frac14; inches; two-thirds
of the difference between these measures are added to the across-chest width
for
normal 37-inch bust girth, giving a total quantity of 8&frac34; inches. In other
words&#8212;</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>Across-chest width for a 34-inch bust = 7&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>Across-chest width for a 37-inch bust = 8&frac14; inches.</li>
	<li>Difference = &frac34; inch.</li>
	<li>Two-thirds of the difference = &frac12; inch.</li>
	</ul>
<p>If the total increase of girth is added to the front, this would mean an
increase of 1&frac12; inches to the across-chest width, as the draft would be
based upon a 34-inch bust circumference. The across-chest width would become
7&frac12; inches plus 1&frac12; inches, a total of 9 inches. By computating
the
across-chest increase of width by two-thirds of the difference between the
normal widths for the two bust girths, a slightly wider scye is obtained,
which is needed as women of the full-bust type usually are well developed
about the shoulders and arms.</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>15 from 8 = one-fourth of the bust girth, 18&frac12; inches less 1 inch,
plus two-thirds of the difference between the across-chest width for a normal
34-inch bust and 37-inch bust girths, i.e. 8&frac34; inches as described
above.</li>
	<li>16 from 15 = one-sixth of the scale (17 inches).</li>
	<li> Square up from 16 to 17 equal to the distance from 8 to 13 less &frac12;

	<li>19 from 18 = &frac14; inch. Shape the back shoulder seam from 19 to 5.</li>
	<li>20 from 17 = the front shoulder width equal to the width of the back
shoulder seam from 19 to 5 less &frac14; inch.</li>
	<li>21 from 20 = 1 inch. Shape the front shoulder seam from 21 to 17.</li>
	<li>The sideseam is located at 22, half the bust measure from 1 to 8.</li>
	<li>Square down from 22 to 23, 24 and 25.</li>
	<li>Measure from 10 to 26 half the hip measure net.</li>

24 to 27 and 28 in equal divisions each side of point 24.</li>

	<li>Shape the sideseams, suppressing the waist &frac12; inch at 31 and 32 from

and adding 2&frac12; inches of flare to each sideseam from 30 to 33 and 29 to
34.</li>
	<li>Measure from 2 to 35 half the waist measure (15&frac12; inches) plus the
distance from 31 to 32.</li>
	<li>The back waist suppression takes two-thirds of the surplus quantity
shown between points 35 and 9.</li>
	<li>The front waist suppression equals the remaining quantity from 36 to
9.</li>
	<li>Mark the back waist dart from 2 to 37, one-sixth of the half-hip
measure, 3 inches approximately.</li>
	<li>38 from 37 = the quantity shown from 35 to 36.</li>
	<li>Shape out the back waist dart to 1 inch above 39.</li>
	<li>39 from 3 = 2 to 37 plus &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>The dart is made 7 inches in length.</li>
	<li>Mark out the waist suppression above 37 and 38 to 40, 41 and 42,
suppressing &frac12; inch at 41 and terminating the suppression lines at 42.</li>
	<li>The front neck opening from 13 to 43 is made equal to one-sixth of the
scale (18&frac12; inches).</li>
	<li>Shape the back curve from 43 to 14.</li>
	<li>44 from 17 = 1 inch.</li>
	<li>45 is half the distance from 8 to 15.</li>
	<li>Join 44 to 45 and continue down to 46.</li>
	<li>46 from 45 = 2 inches.</li>
	<li>47 from 44 = the quantity taken from the bust dart at the shoulder equal
to the distance from 17 to 14.</li>
	<li>Shape out the dart from 44 and 47 to 46 and continue the front waist
suppression up from the waist seam to terminate at 46.</li>
	<li>48 from 9 = 3 inches.</li>
	<li>49 from 48 = the front waist suppression equal to the distance from 36
to 9.</li>
	<li>50 from 10 = &frac12; inch more than 48 to 9 so that the waist suppression
lines are equal in length from the pivoting point.</li>
	<li>51 from 49 = the depth of the pocket opening from the waist line, in
this instance 3 inches.</li>
	<li>Square across from 51 to 52 to allow for the waist suppression
factor.</li>
	<li>53 from 32 = 6 inches. Shape from 53 to 51 for the pocket seam
opening.</li>
	<li>Square down from 50 to 54 at the hem line for the manipulation line of
the front skirt.</li>
	<li>The front opening terminates at 56, 3 inches from the waist seam at
9.</li>
	<li>57 from 56 = 3&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>58 from 57 = 6 inches.</li>
	<li>Shape the lowered shoulder line from 58 to 59, 60 and 61 as shown.</li>
	<li>61 from the breast line = 3 inches.</li>
	<li>The line from 58 to 61 breaks at the bust dart in the manner shown, so
that 60 from 46 equals 46 to 59 and, when the bust dart is sewn out, from 58
to 61 becomes an unbroken line.</li>
	<li>62 is &frac12; inch below the back pitch B, which is located in the usual
manner at half the back depth, from X to 1, up from point 6.</li>
	<li>Shape the drop-shoulder line at the back from 62 to finish at point 1 at
the scye level.</li>
	</ul>
<p>A seam is placed through the waist from front to back, and the back waist
suppression is closed out by pivoting from 42 and closing 37 to 38.</p>
<p>Add &frac34; inch down the front opening from 63 to 64 as shown to complete the
draft.</p>
<p>Manipulation of the front skirt and bodice is illustrated by the second
diagram in Fig. 139. Pivoting from point 46, close out the bust dart by
closing 44 to 47 to open the sideseam dart at 55 to A. The drop-shoulder line
from 58 to 59, 60 and 61 in the first diagram now becomes a continuous line,
and the yoke so formed may be cut away from the bodice.</p>
<p>Close out the waist suppression from 48 to 49 to open the sideseam dart at
55 which becomes lowered to line B to 46.</p>
<p>The quantity shown between A and B is reduced by two sideseam darts as
shown by the solid lines, each dart being 4 inches in length.</p>
<p>The skirt is manipulated so as to close out the waist suppression by
closing 48 to 49, pivoting from 50. The hem-line width increases from 54 to
54 as the waist dart is closed out, and the seam from the waist at 48 joins
up with the pocket mouth seam from 51 to 53.</p>
<p>Add 4 inches at the centre front for the inverted pleat as indicated by
points 65 to 68 and 69.</p>

Line (Fig. 141)</h3>
<p>The dress illustrated by the following draft shows the drop-shoulder line
cut in one with the sleeve. The shoulder treatment gives a sloping-shoulder
effect, as the shoulder line is kept low towards the base of the armhole and
disappears at the scye to become part of the one-piece sleeve. A high neck
line is included in the design with a jabot bow for fastening at the fronts
and a centre back opening with buttons.</p>
<p>The skirt design shows a panel seam running from a slightly higher waist
line in front to a low line at the back. A fairly full flared hem line is
attained by panel seam flaring, and the design gives a lesson on the
application of waist suppression principles to a design without the aid of a
waist seam.</p>

Bodice Patterns (Fig. 143)</h3>
    <p>Manipulation of the back and forepart bodice patterns for obtaining
waist suppression is carried out as follows. Cut through the suppression
lines from 58 and 57 to 62 and down from 61 to 62. Close 58 to 57 by pivoting
from 62, which causes the shoulder seam to lengthen as shown. Shape the
shoulder-yoke seam from 63 to 64 and re-mark the outline of the pattern from
19, 29 and 34 to 57.</p>
<p>The bodice front is manipulated as follows. To obtain a whole shoulder
yoke and bodice front close out the bust dart from 17 to 43, pivoting from
41, and close out the waist suppression dart from 49 to 50. The sideseam bust
dart line from 44 to 42 consequently moves to 44A and 44B; therefore, the
distance between these two points comprises the amount to be taken from the
sideseams by the bust dart. The quantity registered between 44A and 44B is 2
inches, so two bust darts are marked from 44A and 44 to C and D, each equal
in size to half the total quantity to be darted out.</p>
<p>The front shoulder yoke becomes one piece by the act of closing out the
shoulder dart, and the broken line from 67 to 68 and 69 to 70 becomes a
continuous seam run.</p>

in the usual manner. To produce the leg-of-mutton sleeve, it is first
necessary to realize that length and width are required in the sleeve head to
form the pouch effect by either darts or gathers. There must be extra length
down the sleeve to provide for the increased size of the sleeve at the
shoulder when the darts or gathers are sewn out. Therefore, the sleeve
pattern must be manipulated to produce extra length and width.</p>
<p>Mark the following manipulation lines on the one-piece pattern according
to whether the pouch effect is required to be high at the shoulder end or low
down at the elbow.</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>1 from the sleeve head = 6 inches.</li>
	<li>2 from the sleeve head at the hindarm under-sleeve seam = 6 inches.</li>
	<li>Join 1 to 2 to locate point 3 at the centre of the arm.</li>
	<li>4 is located at the centre of the sleeve head.</li>
	<li>Join 4 to 3 to find point 5.</li>
	<li>5 up from 3 = 3 inches.
	  <ul>
	    <li>This pivoting point controls the sleeve fullness and by being raised
    or lowered this point will give either higher-placed fullness or, inversely,
    fullness nearer the elbow of the sleeve.</li>
        <li>Decide the number of darts in the sleeve head and then mark each
          side of point 4 the desired number. If an even number of darts is required,
          add the
  extra dart at the front of the sleeve head and, if an uneven number of darts,
  make point 4 the centre dart position. Six darts are shown on the draft;
  therefore, points 6 to 10 are spaced 1&frac12; inches apart for the darts
  position.</li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
	<li>11 and 12 are the underseams.</li>
	<li>Mark manipulation lines from 8 to 5, 7 to 5, 6 to 5, 9 to 5 and 10 to
5.</li>
	</ul>
<p>Cut through the manipulation lines from the above six dart positions to 5,
keeping just sufficiently away from this point to enable the sleeve pattern
to be manipulated without the various sections becoming detached. Cut through
from 5 to 2 and 1, making sure that the sleeve does not become separated.</p>
<p>Fig. 145 (b) shows the manipulation in detail. By pivoting from points 1,
2 and 5, open out the six darts to allow for 1&frac14; inches of extra width for
a dart at each of the points. As the darts are opened, the sleeve will
increase in width and length as indicated by the shaded lines, subsequently
to be drawn back to form a pouch effect when the darts are sewn out.</p>
<p>There are many methods of taking out the darts. They may be pleated over
when the sleeve is sewn into the armhole, in the form of either small knife
or box pleats. Alternatively, they may be sewn out inside the sleeve like an
ordinary dart, or as an outside dart to show machine stitching. Another
method is to dispense with darts and to gather the sleeve into the armhole,
firstly drawing in the fullness with a thread or by machine.</p>

146)</h3>
    <p>The pouched-hindarm sleeve is reproduced from a one-piece sleeve base,
drafted in the usual manner, with the seam placed at the forearm and the
hind-arm of the sleeve cut on the fold of the material from sleeve head to
elbow.</p>
<p>Fig. 146 (a) shows the basic pattern with a shaped cuff marked from 1 to 2
and 3, commencing 6 inches from the end of the sleeve. Point 4 indicates
where the fold edge of the sleeve ends, and 5 is the pivoting point for
increasing the elbow width.</p>
<p>Fig. 146 (b) illustrates the manipulation. The need for extra width and
length at the hindarm to form the pouch effect must be observed. Pivoting
from point 5, sweep from 4 to 4A a distance of 2 inches. Line through from 5
to 4A and continue down to 6 and 7. Pivoting from 5, sweep from 3 to 6 the
length from 5 to 3.</p>
<p>The extra length at the hindarm is added from 6 to 7. The amount added
varies with the effect required, and an average quantity is 1&frac12; inches.
Shape round from 2 to 7 and from point 8 on the under-sleeve as indicated; 9
from 3 is 1 inch, and the sleeve seams from 2 and 8 pass through this point.
The increase of width from 9 to 7 may be reduced by three darts at the
forearm and hindarm as marked by dash lines or by gathers as indicated by
Fig. 146 (c), showing the reconstructed shape of the sleeve.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a name="vertical" id="vertical"></a><em><a href="illust/147.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,795);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/147-t.jpg" alt="Figure 147" width="220" height="170" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig147" id="fig147"></a>Sleeve with Vertical Fullness (Fig.
147)</h3>
<p>The basic pattern utilized for producing this type of sleeve is the plain
one-piece pattern with seams at the underarm. Length must be infused in one
half of the sleeve to form a ruched effect at the hindarm from the shoulder
to the elbow, in addition to a slightly pouched effect above the elbow.</p>
<p>Fig. 147 (a) indicates the manipulation.</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>From 1 to 2 mark down the exact centre of the sleeve or where the seam
down the arm is required.</li>
	<li>3 and 4 from the wrist are each 8 inches.</li>
	<li>Join 3 to 4 and locate point 5, 2&frac12; inches from 3.</li>
	<li>6 from 1 = the normal position of the hindarm pitch.</li>
	<li>Join 6 to 5 to find point 7.</li>
	<li>7 from 5 = 1&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>Join 3 and 4 to 7.</li>
	<li>Mark four manipulation lines from 8, 9, 10, and 11 on the centre sleeve
seam to the line from 6 to 7, and three manipulation lines from 12, 13 and 14
to locate points 15 to 21 on the line from 6 to 7.</li>
	<li>Cut through the sleeve from 6 to 7 and from 7 to 3 and 4, taking care
that the cuts are not carried right through the sleeve. Next cut through the
manipulation lines at 8 to 11 to points 15 to 18 respectively and from points
12 to 14 to points 21 and 19.</li>
	</ul>
<p>By pivoting from 6 and the points marked on the line from 6 to 7, open out
the sleeve as indicated by Fig. 147 (b), allowing 1 inch of fullness to each
of the cuts at the centre and hindarm seams. The extra length to form the
pouched effect is obtained as the darts open and increase the distance
between the centre and hindarm sleeve seams and the position of point 6 from
5.</p>
<p>Shape round the reconstructed sleeve outline from 3 to 1 and 6 to 12 and
4. The sleeve fullness is either darted or gathered to the plain sleeve front
from between the points A and B on the centre sleeve seam and between C and D
on the under-sleeve seam (Fig. 147(c)).</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a name="double" id="double"></a><em><a href="illust/148.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',450,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/148-t.jpg" alt="Figure 148" width="257" height="198" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig148" id="fig148"></a>The Double Pouched Sleeve (Fig. 148)</h3>
<p>The double pouched sleeve consists of a tight-fitting one-piece sleeve
with a three-quarter- or half-length sleeve sewn to the tight-fitting sleeve
to form the pouched effect.</p>
<p>Both sleeves are derived from the standard one-piece pattern, and the
extra width and length to form the pouch are infused by manipulating as
indicated on the lines laid down in the previous draft descriptions.</p>
<p>Points 1 to 4 are the outline of the one-piece sleeve pattern.</p>
<p>Five and 6 from 3 and 4 indicate where the pouched top-sleeve sews to the
tight-fitting under-sleeve. Add 3 inches of extra length from 5 to 8 and 6 to
7; then mark four manipulation lines from 9, 10, 11 and 12 at the sleeve head
down to 13, 14, 15 and 16 at the end of the top sleeve.</p>
<p>Cut through each of the manipulation lines from 13, 14, 15 and 16 to 12,
11, 10, and 9 respectively. By pivoting from points 9, 10, 11 and 12, open
out the sleeve pattern by inserting 2 &frac12; inches of extra width at each of
the following points: 13 to 13A, 14 to 14A, 15 to 15A and 16 to 16A, as in
Fig. 148 (b). Reshape the top sleeve outline from 1 to 2 round the sleeve
head and from 8 to 7 round the sewing edge.</p>
<p>The increase of width from 7 to 8 is drawn in to agree with the distance
from 5 to 6 in Fig. 148 (a), or may be reduced by means of darts or
pleats.</p>
<p>The top sleeve must be mounted on a tight-fitting foundation to form the
&quot;drop&quot; of the pouch; otherwise, if the sleeve from 7 to 8 were sewn
to 5 to 6 without the foundation going right through to the armhole, the
result would be that the wrist part from 3 and 4 to 5 and 6 would drop down
and the pouched effect lost.</p>

<p>The &quot;cowl&quot; or draped sleeve is a recent style and is very
suitable for evening and afternoon dress sleeves, in addition to its
adaptability for swagger or town coats. It resembles a &quot;cowl&quot; in

&quot;cowl&quot; effect there must be both additional length and width in a
triangular form as an addition to the basic outline of the pattern where the

&quot;cowl&quot; is intended to drape.</li>
	<li>Join 4 to 3 to locate point 5.</li>
	<li>5 from 3 = 1&frac12; inches.
	  <ul>
	    <li>Divide the distance from 12 to 1 into three parts and mark two
    manipulation lines from 6 and 7 to the centre line at 10 and 11. Divide the
    distance from 2 to 13 by three and mark two manipulation lines from 8 and
	      9 to 10 and 11.</li>
        <li>Cut through the pattern from 4 to 5 and from 5 to 1 and 2. Cut through
  each of the manipulation lines from 10 to 6, 11 to 7, 10 to 8 and 11 to 9,
  and open out the pattern to the outline indicated by Fig. 149 (b) until the
  points at the sleeve crown indicated by 4 and 4A are spaced from 7 to 8 &frac12;
  inches apart. The manipulation lines from points 10 and 10 on each side of
  the centre line become spaced 1 to 1&frac12; inches apart as the sleeve head
  opens from 4 to 4A.</li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
	<li>Join 4 to 4A and locate point 14 midway of 4 to 4A.</li>
	<li>Square up from 14 to 15 2 inches for extra length to form the turn-back
fold-edge of the cowl.</li>
	<li>Shape from 4 to 15 and 4A. From 15 to 5 is the addition of extra length
and from 4 to 15 and 4A is the addition of width necessary to form the
&quot;cowl&quot; effect.</li>
	<li>When the sleeve is being made up, 4A is placed to 4 and the sleeve
folded down the centre and sewn from 4 and 4A to 15. The sleeve head is then
notched-in at 4 to allow for a seam round the crown for sewing into the
armhole, and then the extra length from 15 to 5 drapes down over the arm to
form the cowl.</li>
	</ul>
<p>The preceding drafts indicate the general manipulation of a basic sleeve
pattern for draped and pouched effects. With practice, the cutting of fancy
sleeve designs becomes simplified as the knowledge of where and how to
manipulate the outline pattern becomes familiar. Always keep in mind the
principle of additional length and width for pouch effects, and the points
where this addition must be made will become automatically fixed.</p>

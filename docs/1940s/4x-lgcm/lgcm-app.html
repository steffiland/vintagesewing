  <h2>Appendix</h2>
<p>LADIES' GARMENT CUTTING AND MAKING has now been before the tailoring trade
for over twelve years and, while reports from readers have always been of the
highest praise, it is felt that with the changing of style in cutting to a
more accentuated fit and the changing of women's figures through the
perfecting of foundation garments, uplift brassieres, and the like, the
system perhaps needs some modification in practice though not in general
principles.</p>
<p>While the system as laid down throughout this work is adaptable to any
demands made on it, to save unnecessary fitting adjustments it has been
decided to describe the basis systems in a revised form suitable to the
modern style of cutting and the modern figure. The necessary adjustments are
from the point of view of style only; the basic principles of the original
system are retained.</p>
<p> The tendency of modern styling is to accentuate the width of shoulders at
back and front of the scye, what is known in the trade as &quot;drape,&quot;
and whilst for a short period, in the &quot;New Look&quot; days, we had
styling that narrowed the shoulders at front and back in order to accentuate
the bust, the normal trend of styling is for width through the shoulders,
tapering to a narrow waist.</p>
<p> To the users of the original system, this change of styling would present
no difficulties; it would involve only the addition of width in the parts
where required, and this would mean an easing out of the constructional
points throughout the draft. For example, we need a &frac12;-inch wider back and
forepart over the bust. The addition of the extra inch in the locations,
where required, would involve adjustments in the hip overlap and the waist
suppression factors. The neckpoint forward from the front of the scye would
remain constant in its present position, the extra &frac12; inch being spread over
the whole across the bust width and necessitating an increased bust dart to
achieve the increased bust contour shape. Below the bust, there would not be
any change in the fitting of the waist and hip sections, unless it is desired
to accentuate the waist still further, as is customary in styling these days.
The pattern would need the extra width added through the bust to be
suppressed at the hip level.</p>
<p> The extra width through the back is located at the sides and calls for
increased waist suppression, but not of hip suppression as basically the
blade points at point of hip prominences still bear the same relationship to
each other as in the original draft system.</p>
<p> The shoulder slope remains unchanged, allowing for a small pad on the
point. For thicker pads it is an elementary procedure to raise the height of
shoulder slope by adjustment of the point located on the line squared up from
the centre of the scye.</p>
<h3 class="clear"> <em><a href="illust/362.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,456);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/362-t.jpg" alt="Figure 362" width="145" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig362" id="fig362"></a>Basis
Draft for Short Jacket (Fig. 362)</h3>
<p> The following is a description of changes and revision necessary to the
basis draft for short jackets in order to eliminate unnecessary adjustments
at fitting time for the achievement of the modern style outline.</p>
<p> It must be understood that the changes made are within the framework of
the basis system as described previously and may be incorporated in the block
pattern without recourse to the present system draft, if so desired.</p>
<p> The trend of style to-day is for a semi-draped jacket; tomorrow we may
again be back to form-fitting style throughout the shoulders, but to-day
semi-drape and drape are the current fashions.</p>
<p> It does not present many difficulties to add width in the pattern where
required, but for those cutters who prefer the width to be incorporated in a
systematic draft, then the following will be of value.</p>
<p> It has been decided, for example, to add an extra 1 inch across back and
extra 1 inch across chest, i.e. &frac12; inch on the &frac12; x back measure and &frac12;
inch on the &frac12; x chest measure. These additions will provide for a
moderately draped front and back scye.</p>
<p> The measurements for the draft will read as follows&#8212;</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>Chest = 34 inches.</li>
	<li>Bust = 36 inches.</li>
	<li>Waist = 28 inches.</li>
	<li>Hips = 40 inches.</li>
	<li>Natural waist =15&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>Full length = 26 inches.</li>
	<li>Half back = 7&frac14; inches.</li>
	<li>Working Scale = half the bust girth = 18 inches.</li>
	</ul>
<p> To draft&#8212;</p>
<p>Commence by drawing line X to X, the full length of the jacket.</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>1 from X = one-third scale plus 1&frac34; inches = 7&frac34; inches.</li>
	<li>2 from X = waist length 15&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>3 from 2 = 8 inches for hip level.</li>
	<li>4 from X = one-sixth scale less &frac14; inch.</li>
	<li>5 from 4 = 1 inch. Shape the neck curve from 5 to X.</li>
	<li>6 from 1 = half back width plus &frac14; inch = 7&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>7 is squared from 6.</li>
	<li>8 from 1 = half bust plus 3 inches.</li>
	<li>Square up to 9 and square back from X.</li>
	<li>10 from 9 = one-twelfth scale.</li>
	<li>11 from 10 = one-sixth scale.</li>
	<li>12 from 8 = one-quarter bust less &frac14; inch.</li>
	<li>13 from 12 = one-sixth scale.</li>
	<li>14 squared from 13 = 8 to 10 less &frac12; inch.</li>
	</ul>
<p>The width of scye from 6 to 12 may also be found as an eighth of the bust
measure plus &frac14; inch.</p>
<p> This is a useful variation from the system when a draft is being made on
direct measure methods, using the across-back measure and across-bust measure
plus the width of scye measurement as indicated.</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>15 is midway 6 to 12.</li>
	<li>16 squared from 15 = one-third scale plus &frac14; inch.</li>
	<li>Square up from 6 to 7, intersecting the shoulder slope line from 16 to 5
at 17.</li>
	<li>18 from 17 = 1 inch.</li>
	<li>19 from 14 = 5 to 18 less 3/8 inch.</li>
	<li>20 from 12 = 1&frac12; inches. Join 20 to 19 and hollow the front of size
&frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>Square down from 8 to 21, 22 and 23.</li>
	<li>24 from 23 = &frac34; inch.</li>
	<li>25 and 26 are squared from 15.</li>
	<li>27 and 28 are each 3/8 inch.</li>
	<li>29 and 30 are each 5/8 inch, making hips overlap 1 inch at half the
difference between bust and hips less 1 inch. This quantity is calculated as
follows&#8212;</li>
	<li>From 1 to 8 = half bust plus 3 inches = 21 inches.</li>
	<li>From 3 to 22 = also 21 inches.</li>
	</ul>
<p> We need at the hips, half hip measurement plus 1&frac14; inches for ease
  and
seams, &frac34; inch and &frac12; inch for two sideseams = 21&frac14; inches,
which is &frac14;
inch more than 3 to 22.</p>
<p> We then need to suppress the front panel seams &frac12; inch and the back
panel seams &frac14; inch = &frac34; inch.</p>
<p> This makes a total of 1 inch which must be added at the sideseams to
compensate.</p>
<p> This equals half the difference between bust and hip measurements less 1
inch as stated.</p>
<p> To look at this from another angle&#8212;</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>1 to 8 = half bust plus 3 inches = 21 inches.</li>
	<li>3 to 22 = 21 inches also.</li>
	<li>Half the difference between bust and hip measurements = 2 inches.</li>
	<li>Add this 2 inches to 3 to 22 = 23 inches.</li>
	<li>We need 21&frac14; inches over the hips.</li>
	<li>Difference = 1&frac34; inches to be reduced on the draft.</li>
	<li>Reduce &frac14; inch at the back panel, &frac12; inch at the front panel and 1
inch from the side of seams.</li>
	</ul>
<p> Therefore, on this draft, the hips overlap always equals half the
difference between bust and hip measurements less 1 inch providing that &frac34;
inch is also reduced at front and back panel seams.</p>
<h5> FORMULA</h5>
	<ul class="small">
	<li> Half hip plus 2 inches = 22 inches = 1&frac14; inches seams/ease,
three-quarter panel suppression.</li>
	<li>Half bust plus 3 inches = 21 inches</li>
	<li>Difference  = 1 inch</li>
	<li>Difference = hip overlap at sideseams.</li>
	<li>31 from 8 = 2 inches for bust point level.</li>
	<li>32 from 31 = one-sixth scale plus 1 inch.</li>
	<li>Square from 32 to 34 and 35.</li>
	<li>33 is pivoted from 32 and 14.</li>
	<li>33 from 14 = 14 to 11.</li>
	<li>36 and 37 from 34 are each &frac12; inch, making 1 inch standard waist panel
suppression for this style of jacket.</li>
	<li>38 from 35 = &frac12; inch or the amount of extra width added through the
bust.</li>
	<li>Shape the front panel seams as shown.</li>
	</ul>
<p> The question of waist suppression now is considered. We have a standard
&frac34; inch taken from the sideseams, plus 1 inch from the front panel seams,
plus &frac12; inch for seams, which makes a total of 2&frac14; inches to be added
to
the tight waist measure of 28 inches.</p>
<p> For ease on the draft, 1&frac12; inches may be allowed which is sufficient
these days.</p>
<p> Therefore the total allowances on top of the waist measurement are as
follows&#8212;</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>2&frac14; inches for suppressions at side and front seams and allowances
	  for
two sideseams at &frac14; inch each.</li>
	<li>1&frac12; inches for general overall ease.</li>
	<li>Total = 3&frac34; inches to be added to the half waist measure.</li>
	</ul>
<p>The formula then becomes&#8212;</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li> Half the bust measure plus 3 inches = 21 inches.</li>
	<li>Half the waist measure plus 3&frac34; inches = 17&frac34; inches.</li>
	<li> Difference  = 3&frac14; inches</li>
	<li>Suppression, one-third front and two-thirds back = 2 1/8 inches back and
1 1/8 inches front.</li>
	<li>Therefore 39 from 21 = waist measure plus 3&frac34; inches.</li>
	<li>Surplus waist increment = 39 to 2.</li>
	<li>One-third of 2 to 39 = 40 to 39.</li>
	<li>41 from 39 = 40 to 2.</li>
	<li>42 is midway.</li>
	<li>Square from 42 to 43.</li>
	<li>44 from 43 = &frac14; inch.</li>
	<li>45 from 18 = 33 to 19.</li>
	<li>Shape the back panel seams as shown.</li>
	<li>Suppress at 46, the quantity indicated from 40 to 39.</li>
	<li>47 from 46 = 4 inches.</li>
	<li>48 from 46 = 3&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>Shape out the dart as shown.</li>
	<li>49 from 10 = one-sixth of scale. Join 49 to 11 and hollow the gorge &frac34;
inch.</li>
	<li>The back sleeve pitch is located at half X to 1 up from 6.</li>
	<li>The front pitch diagonally from 12.</li>
	</ul>
<p> The draft is constructed to fit a figure of 5 feet in height.</p>
<p> The across-chest width is now a style factor rather than a fitting factor
in modern cutting and can vary from half scale, less &frac14; inch to half scale
less 1 inch, depending on the amount of drape required in the jacket.</p>
<p> It is becoming increasingly apparent in modern pattern construction that
the overall measurement of the draft is of no comparison to the size of the
figure. The style factor plays an increasing part in the allowances over the
bust measure, and, whereas in the past the allowances for ease, etc. had some
relationship to the size of the bust, modern styling tends to ignore this and
concentrate on the sense of style balance and, by predetermination, decide
the style factor required in the draft in accordance with the alternate style
objective.</p>
<p>For example, a pattern cutter may decide to cut a full draped jacket. He
decides on a certain width of back and then adds to it a standard width of
scye which his experience tells him is necessary and then adds his
across-bust width to the amount decided upon. To further this example, take a
34 bust draft. He will decide to use a 7&frac12; inch half back width plus a
&frac14;-inch seam; this will register 7&frac34; inches. Add to this amount
the normal
scye width of 4&frac12; inches, and then he decides the draped front scye will
carry an 8&frac14;-inch across-bust width. The overall total of these allowances
will be 7&frac34; inches + 4&frac12; inches + 8&frac14; inches = 20&frac12; inches
or 3&frac12;
inches over the bust size. Going back to our original close-fitting basis
draft, this would indicate a jacket large enough to fit a 37 bust figure. On
the 34 bust figure, however, the jacket will carry a well-draped back and
front scye and with the waist accentuated by the normal suppressions, will
give a style outline of wide shoulders and narrow waist and hips.</p>
<p> So to be <em>au fait</em> with style in relation to pattern cutting is an
important point. There is so much that can be disregarded in pattern systems
in order to gain style and it is necessary to remember that a system is only
the foundation of cutting, the scaffolding to which style is added.</p>
<p> In the following diagram this subject is discussed in a practical way and
shows the building up of a draft for pre-determined measurements.</p>
<h3 class="clear"> <em><a href="illust/363.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,445);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/363-t.jpg" alt="Figure 363" width="142" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig363" id="fig363"></a>The Style Factor (Fig. 363)</h3>
<p> The first consideration is the style of jacket we are going to draft. If
a draped scye jacket is required, we must consider the quantity of drape,
whether semi- or full drape. For this example, we will decide on a full
drape.</p>
<p> The widths to be considered are as follows&#8212;</p>
<p> 1. The back width.</p>
<p> 2. The scye width.</p>
<p> 3. The across-chest or bust width.</p>
<p> Normal widths for the above are, 6&frac12; inches for the half back, 4&frac12;
inches for the scye, and 7&frac34; inches for the across-chest or bust.</p>
<p> Measures&#8212;</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>Chest = 32 inches.</li>
	<li>Bust = 34 inches.</li>
	<li>Waist = 26 inches.</li>
	<li>Hips = 38 inches.</li>
	<li>Natural waist = 16 inches.</li>
	<li>Full length = 26 inches.</li>
	<li>Across back = 7&frac14; inches.</li>
	<li>Scale = half chest 17 inches.</li>
	<li>Height = 5 feet 4 inches.</li>
	</ul>
<p> To draft&#8212;</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>Draw a line from X to X, the full length, plus a seam.</li>
	<li> 1 from X = one-third of scale plus 1&frac34; inches, for normal size depth
plus an extra &frac12; inch for the increased height, total 8 inches.</li>
	<li> 2 from X = waist length plus a seam.</li>
	<li> 3 from 2 = 8 inches for hip level.</li>
	<li> 4 from X = one-sixth of scale less &frac14; inch.</li>
	<li> 5 from 4 = 1 inch.</li>
	<li> 6 from 1 = half back plus a seam, 7&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li> 7 from 6 = one-quarter scale plus &frac14; inch, 4&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li> 8 from 7 = across chest, half scale less &frac14; inch, 8 &frac14; inches.</li>
	<li> This measure shows &frac12; inch extra allowed for front drape.</li>
	<li>Square from 8 to 9, 10 and 11.</li>
	<li> 12 from 11 = &frac34; inch.</li>
	<li>Square from X to 13.</li>
	<li>14 from 13 = one-twelfth of scale.</li>
	<li>15 from 14 = one-sixth of scale.</li>
	<li>16 from 7 = one-sixth of scale.</li>
	<li>17 from 16 = 8 to 14 less &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>18 is midway 6 to 7.</li>
	<li>19 from 18 = one-third of scale plus &frac34; inch.</li>
	<li>An extra &frac12; inch is allowed here on account of the &frac12;-inch increase in
size depth.</li>
	<li>20 is squared from 6.</li>
	<li>Join 19 to 5 to locate 21.</li>
	<li>22 from 21 = 1 inch.</li>
	<li>Make the front shoulder from 17 to 19, 3/8 inch less than from 5 to
22.</li>
	<li>A is 1&frac12; inches up from 7.</li>
	<li>B is half 1 to X up from 6.</li>
	<li>Square from 18 to 23 and 24.</li>
	<li>25 and 26 are each 3/8 inch from 23.</li>
	<li>Measure up the waist from 9 to 27, half waist plus 3&frac34; inches.</li>
	<li>This quantity is made up as follows&#8212;</li>
	<li>1&frac12; inches for ease.</li>
	<li>1 inch from the front panel suppression.</li>
	<li>1&frac14; inches for sideseam suppression and two &frac14; inch seams.</li>
	<li>28 from 27 = one-third of 27 to 2 for the front waist suppression in the
dart.</li>
	<li>28 to 2 = the back waist suppression.</li>
	<li>29 from 2 = &frac34; inch.</li>
	<li>30 from 3 = &frac14; inch.</li>
	<li>31 from 8 = 2 inches for bust point level.</li>
	<li>32 from 31 = half 7 to 8.</li>
	<li>Square from 32 to 33 and 34.</li>
	<li>35 from 34 = &frac12; inch, or half the difference between half chest and
half bust measures.</li>
	<li>36 and 37 are each &frac12; inch from 33.</li>
	<li>Overlap at 38 and 39, the hip overlap calculated as follows.
	  <ul>
	    <li>Half hip 19 inches plus 1&frac14; inches = 20&frac14; inches.</li>
        <li>Suppression at 30, 34 and 35 = &frac34; inch.</li>
	    <li>Total = 21 inches.</li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
	<li> From 3 to 10 = 20&frac14; inches.</li>
	<li>Therefore hip overlap to make up size to 21 inches = &frac34; inch at 38 to
39.</li>
	<li>40 from 6 = 2&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>41 from 29 = 4&frac12; inches.</li>

	<li>Suppress the quantity from 27 to 28 at the dart at 45.</li>
	<li>46 from 15 = 2 inches, pivot from 32 and sweep from 46 to 47, making
this quantity equal to the dart from 17 to 15.</li>
	<li>48 from 14 = one-sixth of scale, join to 15 and hollow the gorge run &frac34;

<p> This draft will be of interest to readers as it shows an approach to
pattern construction that may be new to some students of cutting.</p>
<p> The importance of the chest measure, taken above the bust, has not been
fully exploited in cutting systems, and yet the measure, taken in conjunction
with the bust measure, provides the answer to the degree of bust
prominence.</p>
<p> When measuring a figure, the chest measure registered above the bust line
is normally 2 inches less than the bust measure, and it can be said that the
two measures are identical up to the front of the scye. This fact indicates
that the extra 2 inches is made up by the prominence of the bust. In short,
the across-chest measure should be 2 inches less than the across-bust
measure.</p>
<p> It is possible after this has been established to draft a pattern by the
chest measure as a basis of construction and to add at the bust level the
difference between chest and bust measurements; on the draft this would be
half the differences between bust and chest.</p>
<p> In this way, we take the framework of the figure as a basis for pattern
construction and treat the bust as a local prominence that must be allowed
for, as an addition within the framework of constructional lines based upon
the chest measure.</p>
<p> Measures as follows&#8212;</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>Chest = 32 inches.</li>
	<li>Bust = 34 inches.</li>
	<li>Waist = 26 inches.</li>
	<li>Hips = 37 inches.</li>
	<li>Length to waist = 16 inches.</li>
	<li>Full length = 27 inches.</li>
	<li>Across back = 7 inches.</li>
	<li>Height = 5 feet 4 inches.</li>
	<li>Scale = half chest 16.</li>
	</ul>
<p> The scale taken from the half-chest measure is in accordance with the
principle of this draft, i.e. a system based upon the chart measure.</p>
<p>To draft&#8212;</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>Draw a line from X to X, the full length plus a seam.</li>
	<li>1 from X = one-third of scale plus 1&frac34; inches, plus &frac12; inch
	  for extra
height factor.</li>
	<li>2 from X = waist length plus a seam.</li>
	<li>3 from 2 = 8 inches.</li>
	<li>4 from X = one-sixth of scale 16.</li>
	<li>5 from 4 = 1 inch.</li>
	<li>6 from 1 = half back width gives a seam 7&frac14; inches.</li>
	<li>7 from 6 = one-quarter scale plus &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>8 from 7 = half scale less 1 inch.</li>
	<li>Square from 8 to 9, 10, 11.</li>
	<li>12 from 11 = &frac34; inch.</li>	
	<li>13 is squared from X and 8.</li>
	<li>14 from 13 = one-twelfth of half bust.</li>
	<li>15 from 14 = one-sixth of scale plus &frac14; inch.</li>
	<li>16 from 7 = one-sixth of scale plus &frac14; inch.</li>
	<li>17 from 16 = 8 to 14 less &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>19 from 18 = one-third of scale plus 1 inch.</li>
	<li>Square from 6 to 20. Join 19 to 5 and locate 21.</li>
	<li>22 from 21 = 1 inch. Join 17 to 19.</li>
	<li>24 from 17 = 5 to 22 less 3/8 inch.</li>
	<li>23 from 7 = 1&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>Square from 18 to 25 and 26.</li>
	<li>27 and 28 are each 3/8 inch.</li>
	<li>29 from 8 = 2 inches.</li>
	<li>30 from 29 = one-quarter of scale less &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>Overlap at 31 to 32, half the difference between chest and bust
measurements. 33 from 17 = 17 to 15 pivoted from 30.</li>
	<li>Square from 30 to 34 and 35.</li>
	<li>36 from 35 overlapped is equal to half 31 to 32.</li>
	<li>37 from 9 = half waist plus 2&frac34; inches.</li>
	<li>38 from 37 = one-third of 37 to 2.</li>
	<li>39 from 2 = &frac34; inch.</li>
	<li>40 from 3 = &frac14; inch.</li>
	<li>41 from 37 = half 39 to 38. 42 is midway, square down 43 and overlap at
the hip, 1 inch.</li>
	<li>44 from 41 = 2&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>45 from 44 = half 38 to 39.</li>
	<li>46 is midway, square down to 47 and overlap 1 inch.</li>
	<li>49 and 50 are each 1 inch.</li>
	<li>48 from 6 = 1&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>Shape the sideseams as shown, and the back panel seams, commencing the
distance 17 to 15 back from 5.</li>
	<li>Suppress the amount 37 to 38 from the front dart at 51.</li>
	<li>52 from 14 = one-sixth of scale plus &frac14; inch.</li>
	<li>Join 52 to 15 and hollow the gorge &frac34; inch.</li>
	</ul>
<p> The principle underlying this draft is that while the chest, waist, and
hip measurements may remain constant, the bust measurement may be variable
and not in proportionate ratio to the other measurements.</p>
<p> For example, the bust measure may be either less or more than the
proportionate 2 inch variation with the chest and the increased or decreased
size will always be locally and the method of this draft is to apply the
variation where actually required.</p><p>

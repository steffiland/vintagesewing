<p>THERE is a noticeable lack of systematic dress-cutting knowledge available
to the trade in textbook form in comparison with the many works upon tailored
garment cutting. This is no doubt due to the fact that the available cutting
books have been written by craftsmen of the tailoring school who, with due
credit to their abilities, possibly have had very little practical experience
of dress designing, cutting and making. Anyone with cutting knowledge can
evolve a system to cut any type of garment, but the opportunity of verifying
the system by practical experiment may be lacking. In any case, the meagre
knowledge to hand is of little use for the cutting of modern day and evening
dresses with their demand for extreme closeness and perfection of fit.</p>
	<p>The modern form-fitting dress requires as much (or, in the author's
opinion, more) cutting knowledge and skill as tailored garments, for the
designer is limited in the matter of the number of seams. Many seams are
permissible in the cutting of coats that are impossible to incorporate with a
dress design. In addition, a coat has good tailoring, canvases and linings to
give it &quot;body&quot; and shape as well as the foundation of a dress
underneath, whilst a dress is required to fit perfectly over the underslip
foundation and there is no tailoring to improve the cutting effort. In short,
dress cutting demands sufficient skill in the cutter to produce a garment to
fit perfectly without any outside aid in the form of skill in making; that is
why the author considers that dress cutting requires more knowledge and
ability in comparison with tailored garment cutting.</p>
  <h3> <a name="factors" id="factors"></a>Factors Influencing Fashion
Tendencies</h3>
  <p>Modern dresses are designed to follow the figure form, and a
loosely-fitting waist or hip in a dress is not appreciated by average women.
They read in fashion journals like <em>Vogue</em> and <em>Harper's Bazaar</em> the news that
dresses will be form-fitting this season and do not understand the cutter and
dressmaker who makes them a dress differing in style from the current mode.
It is useless to attempt to instruct clients these days on the fashion
tendencies of the moment; they probably know more about the subject than the
dressmaker and the cutter, for the increase in the number of fashion
periodicals on sale is not due to an increase of interest by the trade, but
by the general public.</p>
<p>Then we have the influence of the cinema upon fashion in dress. Film dress
styles are admitted to be more advanced in style character than those even of
Paris, and to the interested woman are a forecast of what is likely to be
worn in the future. This means that hundreds and thousands of women who go to
see a &quot;smart&quot; film are &quot;dress-conscious&quot; and, by studying
the dresses shown on the screen, they possess an absolute knowledge of the
latest styles. Women, too, endeavour to dress in a similar manner to that of
their screen prototype; we had an example of this with the &quot;Garbo&quot;
coats of a few years back and, more recently, the effect on current design of
the many period films of the Tudor days. So it is not difficult to understand
that our clients often know as much as, or more than, the dressmaker and
cutter about style, which brings us back to the point that cutters must be
prepared and skilful enough to cut intricate and difficult designs from which
the average ladies' tailor would flinch and which would be designated by him
as &quot;impossible to cut.&quot;</p>
<p>Dress cutting and making is a subject apart from tailoring and a more
intensive cutting ability is needed to cope with the demands of fashion,
always assuming that the aim of the cutter is to achieve a perfectly fitting
garment. We have also the complication of cutting dresses to measure down to
anywhere in the region of a 25-inch waist with a hips size of 37 inches and a
bust of 34 inches, with the proviso that the waist must measure this size and
not 3 to 4 inches larger. The function of a waist belt these days is not to
draw material to the figure as some people suppose. Dresses must fit in the
waist without the artificial aid of a belt; evening dresses in particular are
rarely seen with belts or sashes, yet the closely-fitted waist effect must be
there. The &quot;Princess&quot; line is an example of a fitting beltless
evening dress which requires a high degree of cutting skill to make
successfully.</p>
  <h3><a name="bias" id="bias"></a>Bias Cutting</h3>
  <p> Bias cutting is another problem outside the scope of the tailoring
fraternity. This operation is not so easy as just laying the pattern on the
material on the cross; nowhere nearly as simple, for alteration to the
pattern as made for straight layout cutting is needed when cutting on the
bias; otherwise the weight of the material on the cross will pull the dress
out of position at the waist, and no amount of reducing of waist size will
achieve a close fit unless the hip size is reduced to less than the actual
circumference first. But more on this subject at the proper time and
place.</p>
  <h3><a name="outline" id="outline"></a>Manipulation of the Outline
Pattern</h3>
  <p> The art of manipulating and cutting about of the outline pattern for
close-waisted and draped effects is carried out to a greater extent in dress
cutting than any other garment cutting, for successful dress cutting is
impossible from a purely scientific, systematic point of view and is entirely
dependent upon manipulation of the basic outline pattern for achieving
results.</p>
<p>The author has had a great deal of experience of modern dress cutting and
has studied the subject apart from tailored garment cutting. By constantly
designing, cutting and making day and evening dresses he has eliminated the
causes of the majority of defects common to dress cutting and, in the
process, evolved a cutting method that gives satisfaction in nine instances
out of ten; the exception may be due more to the fallibility of the human
element than to any defect in the working of the system. No one can
truthfully say that he or she never makes mistakes. The author has spent many
sleepless nights over little incidents that have been due to the absence of
concentration at the moment of cutting and he can say that a complete absence
of trouble would turn garment cutting into a very dull job; although not
everybody cares for troubles that by their magnified immensity seem to
indicate the need for a complete reorganization of the cutting system!</p>
<p>That is by the way, but the author can state that he rarely needs to alter
a dress at the try-on stage, and very often dispenses with a fitting
altogether as he believes that all garments should be cut as well as possible
in the first instance as though a try-on were impossible. It is the thought
that alterations can be made at the try-on that lowers the standard of
cutting, and, as has been stated before, if all cutters had to cut garments
to finish a higher standard of craftsmanship would result.</p>
<p>The perfecting of the dress system was only possible after extensive
practical experiment, the fact that the best was not good enough always being
kept in mind. The advent of the very close-fitting dresses presented a big
stumbling block, for the necessity for achieving a really close-fitting waist
with the suppression correctly allocated so as not to disturb the balance of
the dress by creases and folds from the waist to the centre back was not an
easy problem to solve.</p>
<p>The author found that if he waisted the dress at the sideseams only, as
was the general principle advocated by the majority of cutters at the time, a
number of creases and folds appeared at the back waist hollow, giving a very
unsightly appearance to the dress which was not at all approved of by the
wearer. These creases naturally had to be eliminated, and, by pinning out the
surplus material, something like a fit was gained. The resultant effect on
the pattern of this alteration seemed to indicate the presence of more length
at the sideseams than was required at the centre back waist hollow, which
ultimately led the author to experiment on the lines laid down in the chapter
on <a href="lgcm-04.html">Waist Suppression</a>.</p>
<p>The author is now confident enough to cut a dress to measure up, say, with
8 inches difference between the waist and bust measures with the sure
knowledge that it will fit the figure perfectly. He believes that modelling
knowledge is of importance to the dress cutter, and scientific, systematic
cutting knowledge to the modeller. The combination of the two makes for a
skilled craftsman, for, while modelling teaches us why we cut as we do,
scientific cutting knowledge enables the foundation work to be laid easier
and more accurately. We produce our basic outline by scientific means and
then use our modelling knowledge in the manipulation of the basic pattern to
produce the contour shape of the figure, for manipulation of the outline
pattern is inseparable from successful dress cutting; it is impossible to cut
a really close-fitting style by a systematic allocation of constructional
points. A cutter who attempts to systematize cutting to such a degree is
obviously without practical knowledge of making; the two go hand-in-hand. It
would only be necessary for a cutter to shape a dress to the figure by taking
in the sideseams indiscriminately, and then endeavour to press open the seams
when sewn, to open his or her eyes to the necessity for providing length at
the sideseams in the waist to enable the dress to conform to the shape of the
figure without stress or strain. Waist shape in either a coat or a dress can
only be obtained by shaping the garment to the figure on the
&quot;bends&quot; of the body and not by reducing the size indiscriminately
in the first region that suggests itself.</p>
  <h3><a name="system" id="system"></a>The Dress System</h3>
  <p> The dress system is founded upon the basic constructional points
derived from the working scale constituting the basic system for coats, with
alterations necessarily dictated by the closer fit required and the absence
of a foundation garment.</p>
<p>The allowance for seams on a dress draft is not advocated, as the variable
textures of the materials in use demand judgment in the matter of provision
for seam allowances. For example, a lace dress would absorb anything up to
&frac12; inch or &frac34; inch seams, while a tweed of firm texture would need only &frac14;
inch allowances. Dress cutting and making is very different from tailoring.
Dressmakers often prefer to leave a fair margin of seam allowance for
letting-out purposes, whilst the tailor, when he cuts a dress, will persist
in the tailoring habit of allowing &frac14; inch seams and an inlay down one side
of the sideseams only. It is a general rule amongst dress cutters to leave an
equal amount down each sideseam in view of the necessity for matching the
design in the event of an alteration involving the taking-in or letting-out
of the sideseams. If an inlay is left on one sideseam only, it is impossible
to match the design when an alteration takes place.</p>
<p>The reduction of seam allowances from the basic draft affects the back
width and across-chest width in addition to the allowances made over the
bust, waist and hip measures. The author does not make any allowance for ease
over the hip measure when cutting the pattern. In these days the fit of the
dress at this part must be perfectly close, though, of course, the type of
woman dealt with must decide the degree of closeness or otherwise. But,
taking into account the fact of the hip measures being taken over another
dress or skirt while the dress will be actually worn over an underslip, the
addition to the hip circumference thus made will provide the amount of ease
necessary. For example, the author has measured women over a tweed skirt
about 1 inch larger in circumference than a similar measure taken over a silk
dress, which, from the practical point of view, would be equal to a measure
taken over the underslip. Therefore, for the average woman he does not make
any allowance for ease over the hip measure taken over a dress or skirt. This
hip measure, incidentally, is taken on the figure in the position where he is
going to apply it on the pattern draft. The system-makers who measure the
hips at 8&frac12; inches below the waist on the figure, and apply this quantity
on their draft at a standard 7 inches down, should not wonder why their
garments are always too large over the hip. There is a decrease of nearly 2
inches in circumference in the short space from 8&frac12; inches to 7 inches
below the waist line. So take all measures on the figure where they will be
applied on the draft.</p>
<p>The allowance for ease over the tight waist measure depends upon the
actual measure, and also a factor that may be thought immaterial and
inconsequent is the ability of the wearer to get into the dress. This may
seem rather of small importance to the cutter who is only interested in the
cutting of garments to size, but it is an important fact that some women are
more skilful at getting into dresses than others. The flexibility of their
limbs is one of the factors governing this. The author has a friend whose
dresses are made 24 inches in size at the waist; her bust size is 33 inches
and her hip size 37&frac12; inches. Her dresses are made without an opening at the
side waist, yet she contrives to wriggle into them without any apparent
effort. The author does not know how this is achieved; he only knows that it
happens. How anyone can contrive to pass a circumference of 24 inches over
another circumference of 33 inches is a mystery. This is an example of the
importance of the human element in dress cutting; so cut all dresses to a
predetermined standard of ease, for all women are not so expert. In contrast
to the above, there are women who find difficulty in getting a dress over
their shoulders when the waist is only 3 inches or so less than the bust size
and with a side opening as well. It is something unexplainable, a fact which
dress cutters who are practical know and appreciate, for whenever possible
the author does not believe in opening the sideseam of a dress as a means of
providing for ease; this sideseam opening does not improve the fitting
qualities of a dress.</p>
<p>The author usually allows 3 inches over the tight waist measure as an
average quantity for ease, the amount depending to a certain extent upon the
texture of the material used. Some tweed and silk materials allow the dress
to be cut closer in fit than others. For instance, a <i>crepe</i> silk of
crinkly texture can be cut closer than a plain weave, for the elasticity of
the former will give to the figure and return to shape when in place, while a
plain weave will sooner split than give an inch. If the material is cut on
the bias, the waist may be cut down to practically the net measure and the
dress will stretch as the wearer gets into it, which makes it possible to cut
dresses without a waist seam or a side opening for perfect fit.</p>
<p>The bust size needs very little addition for ease, unless a loose-fitting
bodice effect is aimed at. The author allows &frac12; inch of ease over the
half-bust measure. This is sufficient for dresses, as they are cut to-day, as
a basic quantity. As with the hips, the fact of the bust measure being taken
over the dress or blouse naturally affects the amount of ease to be
allowed.</p>
<p>The shoulder slope, or the allowance of material needed to cover the
contour shape and size of the shoulders, is reduced in quantity, owing to the
need for a closer fit on the shoulder and the absence of padding of any
description. There is a slight variation of the system from the coat basis
for obtaining the angle of the shoulder slope on dresses. The variation is
made for simplicity and does not affect the constructional points of the
system elsewhere.</p>
<p> For practicability the system is based upon the hip measure and drafted
to the hip size; that is to say, there is no hip overlap shown on the draft,
and the bust circumference is reduced to size by the side-seams being
suppressed by the difference between the half-hip measure and the half-bust
measure after a suitable allowance for ease has been made to this quantity.
This principle of construction is advocated in order to eliminate the
overlapping of the sideseams at the hip, which implies the ability to draft
design seams without having to consider their position in relation to the
overlap and consequent crossing of the drafting lines making the pattern
extremely difficult to cut out without recutting the back and front side
panels twice. By drafting the dress without hip overlap, the design can be
carried out on the flat from back to front, and design lines on the hip are
continuous and not overlapped. When the bust circumference in comparison with
the hip girth is such that no reduction of size takes place at the sideseams
between the bust and hip measures, the dress is drafted to the bust measure
and the hips correspondingly reduced to measure. This factor occurs in the
drafting of patterns for prominent development of the bust.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><a name="basic" id="basic"></a><em><a href="illust/105.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,288);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/105-t.jpg" alt="Figure 105" width="100" height="224" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig105" id="fig105"></a>Basic Construction of the Dress System
(Fig. 105)</h3>
  <p> The basic system for dress cutting is illustrated by Fig. 105. For
convenience the system is based on the normal 34-inch bust girth, as the
divisions of the scale should be familiar by now.</p>
<p>Full measures are as follows&#8212;</p>
    <ul class="small">
      <li>Chest = 32 inches.</li>
	<li>Bust = 34 inches.</li>
	<li>Waist = 25 inches, plus 3 inches for ease.</li>
	<li>Hips = 38 inches.</li>
	<li>Natural waist length = 15 inches.</li>
	<li>Full length = 43 inches.</li>
	<li>Half-back width = 6&frac14; inches.</li>
	<li>Working scale = half the bust girth = 17 inches.</li>
	</ul>
<p>No seams are allowed on the draft.</p>
<p>To draft&#8212;</p>
<p>Square from point X.</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>1 from X = the back depth = one-third of the scale plus 1&frac12;
inches.
	  <ul>
	    <li>It will be noted there is a reduction of &frac14; inch in the back-depth
    quantity in comparison with the basis draft for coats. This takes place owing
    to the need for a slightly shallower armhole with dresses than for coats,
	      and to the fact that the dress lies closer to the back of the figure,
	      whereas the
    coat requires more length to lie over the dress.</li>
      </ul>
	</li>
	<li>2 from X = the natural waist length = 15 inches. This balance line is placed
	  higher or lower to agree with the vagaries of fashion.</li>
	<li>3 from 2 = 8 inches down for the hip level.
	  <ul>
	    <li>The position of the hip balance line never varies on the draft. Even
    if the fashion waist line is raised or lowered, the hip balance line remains
    in the same position, i.e. the position decided by its relationship to the <i>normal</i> waist. The author finds it an advantage to take a direct
    measure on the figure of the exact position of the hip line from the nape of
    the neck and to apply this measure to the draft irrespective of the location
    of the waist position.</li>
      </ul>
	</li>
	<li>4 from X = the full length of the dress = 45 inches, or to taste.</li>
	<li>Square out from the above-named points.</li>
	<li>The width of the back neck from X to 5 is made the same as for coats,
i.e. one-sixth of the scale less &frac14; inch.</li>
	<li>6 from 5 = &frac34; inch. A reduction of &frac14; inch takes place at this point,
as a dress lies flat to the neck and not over another garment.</li>
	<li>Shape the back neck run from 6 to X.</li>
	<li>7 from 1 = the half-back width applied net without a seam.</li>
	<li>Square up from 7 to the construction line squared from X to locate point
8.</li>
	<li>Measure out on the hip balance line from 3 to 9 the half-hip measure
net. This width is the basic constructional factor of the dress system.</li>
	<li>Square the front centre line from 9 to locate points 10, 11, 12 and
13.</li>
	<li>14 from 11 = the back depth from X to 1 plus one-twelfth of the
scale.</li>
	<li>Square out from 14 to 15 one-sixth of the scale.</li>
	<li>The across-chest width from 11 to 16 is the quantity as described for
coat cutting reduced by &frac14; inch, as the &frac14; inch seam that is allowed round
the armhole is eliminated in a system using net measures.</li>
	<li>Therefore 16 from 11 = half the scale less 1 inch instead of less &frac34;
inch.</li>
	<li>Square up from 16 to the balance line squared from X.</li>
	<li>17 from 16 for the position of the neck point for providing the bust
dart = one-sixth of the scale less &frac14; inch. This reduction of &frac14; inch from
the position of the neck point is explained by the reduction by &frac14; inch of
the width from 11 to 16.</li>
	<li>17 from 16 is the same quantity as for coats. The alteration to the
location of point 17 does not affect the position of 16.</li>
	<li>Square up from 17 to 18 equal to 11 to 14 less &frac12; inch.
	  <ul>
	    <li>The position of the sideseam is located by point 19, midway between
    3 to 9 on the hip level. The sideseam is placed in this position in order
	      to simplify the designing of dresses with panels and seamings of identical
	      shape
    and width at back and front.</li>
      </ul>
	</li>
	<li>Square from 19 to 20, 21 and 22.</li>
	<li>23 from 16 = one-sixth of the scale.</li>
	<li>The shoulder slope is decided by the position of point 24 below 8.</li>
	<li>24 from 8 = 1 inch always.</li>
	<li>Square out from 24 to 25 &frac14; inch for the shoulder seam end.</li>
	<li>Join 25 to 6 and shape the shoulder seam.</li>
	<li>Join 18 to 26 and 25.
	  <ul>
	    <li>26 from 18 = the shoulder seam length equal to 6 to 25 less &frac14; inch
    only. Additional ease for the back shoulder seam is provided when the back
    waist suppression is manipulated, as will be explained in the next draft.</li>
      </ul>
	</li><li>Square down from 26 to 27 1 inch always.</li>
	<li>Shape the shoulder seam from 18 to 27.</li>
	<li>Measure from 11 to 28 half the bust measurement plus 1 inch.
	  <ul>
	    <li>It has been previously mentioned that the allowance for ease over
    the half-bust measure is &frac12; inch, but as &frac12; inch is lost at the back under
    the shoulder blades as described in the coat systems this must be added to
    the overall addition.</li>
      </ul>
	</li>

</ul>
<p>In the chapter on <a href="lgcm-04.html">Waist Suppression</a>, the inadvisability was stressed of
suppressing the sideseams of any garment to a great degree, as it is
unpractical and not in accordance with the demands of the figure shape at
this section. Emphasis was laid on the need for length at the sideseams and
suppression on the &quot;bends&quot; of the body, and to this end the
sideseams were suppressed only 3/8 inch each side. For a dress the author
normally increases this quantity to &frac12; inch.</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>33 from 32 = &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>34 from 31 = &frac12; inch as above.</li>
	<li>For stride room from the hips to the knees, the sideseams are overlapped
at the hem line from 22 to 35 and 36 by 1 inch each side.</li>
	<li>Shape the sideseams from 29 to 34, 19 and 35, and from 30 to 33, 19 and
36, making gradually curving seam runs as shown.</li>
	<li>37 from 14 = one-sixth of the scale for the neck curve.</li>
	<li>Shape from 37 to 15 to complete the basis draft for dresses.
	</li></ul>
<p>With this draft no attempt to show waist suppression is made. In the
description of the following diagram this will be dealt with fully.</p>

	</ul>
<p>The waist suppression as indicated is suitable for a dress with panel
seams in the skirt. Flare is added to the skirt at the panels if a flared
skirt is required and pleats may be inserted otherwise. Enough width is added
at the sideseams for the needs of stride room, and if a plain skirt is
required the author does not increase this width.</p>
<p>The suppressions as marked are reduced from the draft immaterially to the
style of the design, and are essential to the requirements of a clean waist
fit. Even if the dress has a perfectly plain skirt and bodice, these
suppressions must be taken out and the following diagram will illustrate the
author's method of cutting a dress with a closely-fitting waist line without
darts or panel seams. This draft will be the basis for interpreting intricate
styles and will illustrate the principle of taking out the suppressions
before the design is drafted. When cutting any garments, the requirements of
fit, such as waist suppression, hip overlap, bust darts, must be
satisfactorily settled, and then the design is made to harmonize and agree
with the construction.</p>

Waist Suppression (Fig. 107)</h3>
<p>Fig. 107 shows the manipulation of the outline pattern by closing out the
waist suppressions to obtain a whole back and forepart pattern. The
interpretation of design is facilitated by the provision of a whole pattern
instead of arranging the design on the draft and then endeavouring to take
out the necessary suppression.</p>
<p>The back is manipulated by closing out the waist suppression from 39 to 40
by cutting up the pattern from 39 and 40 to a point at the blade where the
waist suppressions terminate, and by cutting down the back shoulder from 43
to the same point on the blade and then, pivoting from the blade point,
closing out the suppression to obtain a pattern outline as indicated by X to
24, 28, 36 and 2. This manipulation will result in the back shoulder width
being increased by approximately &frac14; inch, thus making up the &frac12; inch more
length of back shoulder than at the front for the requirements of easing-in.
It is essential to ease the back shoulder in to the front for the attainment
of a clean shoulder free from creases. The closing-out of the waist
suppression gives the curved waist seam, without which it would be impossible
for the back section to fit closely into the waist as it passes round the
figure to the side.</p>
<p>The back skirt section is manipulated by closing out the waist suppression
from 39 to 40, and, pivoting from point 41 on the hip line, opening out the
skirt width at the hem line as shown. Re-mark the skirt pattern to agree with
the effect of reducing the waist suppressions.</p>
<p>When the skirt is required to be perfectly plain in design without panel
seams, the author does not cut the skirt width any wider than the amount
indicated from 13 to 38 plus 4 to 37 in Fig. 106, unless the design calls for
extra flare or width. But as the closing-out of the waist suppression gives
an increase of skirt width at the hem line, to counteract this extra width,
he drafts his basic pattern without the addition of the overlap from 22 to 38
and 37, and makes his sideseams as 19 to 22 for both the back and front
skirt. If a panel back and plain front design is needed, he does not add the
overlap on the front skirt and retain it on the back. Panel skirts generally
do not require manipulation of the pattern as described; the suppressions are
reduced direct from the seams or from a hip yoke, and the sideseam overlap is
retained as drafted. Pleats or flare may be added to the panel seams as a
supplement to the skirt width, but for a narrow skirt width the author does
not increase the width above the circumference indicated.</p>
<p>The front bodice shows the manipulation of the bust dart and the front
waist suppression to obtain a whole front with an underarm sideseam dart for
bust shape. Join up the bust dart and the waist suppression by continuing the
bust dart down to 48, and then cut the pattern through from 18 and 50 to 48
and from 45 to 48. Cut the pattern from a point 3 inches below the breast
line at 29 to link up with 48. Close out from 50 to 18 and at 45 the waist
suppression which opens the underarm bust dart as shown. Mark the dart 4
inches in length as indicated.</p>
<p>The front skirt section is manipulated by closing out the front waist
suppression at 45, and by pivoting from point 46 on the hip line to open the
skirt width at the hem line from 47 to 47 and 38; and, if the skirt is
required to be cut in one piece, the side-seam is reduced by the quantity of
overlap shown from 22 to 38 in Fig. 106.</p>
<p>This completes the principles of manipulating the basic outline pattern
for obtaining waist suppression in a dress without darts or panel seams.</p>

to be described is the provision for drafting the skirt waist to the exact
finished size required with the extra width of the skirt hem line
automatically adjusted. The overlapping of the sideseams from the hip line

<p>The skirt draft as shown is suitable for the construction of dress
patterns with panel-seam and hip-yoke effects, and, by closing out the waist
suppressions, a skirt section in one piece may be obtained. In the following
drafts will be indicated the methods of adjusting the size of the waist to
agree with the skirt hem line width.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><a name="reducing" id="reducing"></a><em><a href="illust/109.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,426);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/109-t.jpg" alt="Figure 109" width="135" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig109" id="fig109"></a>Reducing the Waist Measure to Size
(Fig. 109)</h3>
  <p> The reduction of the waist measure to finished size is attained in the
following manner. Fig. 109 depicts the draft of the skirt section of a dress,
with the usual suppressions marked out by panel seams. To eliminate the
closing out of the waist suppressions and opening of the skirt hem width for
obtaining a skirt section in one piece, we must endeavour to arrange the
drafting alteration to give a similar effect to that attained by the usual
manipulation.</p>
<p>The draft is based on the same measures as previous examples, and, with
the exception of 12 and 13, points X to 21 are drafted as described by the
text appertaining to Fig. 108.</p>
<p>It has been established that the front waist suppression takes one-third
of the waist surplus quantity over the hip measure and the back waist
suppression takes two-thirds. These quantities are marked on the draft from
14 to 15 and 16 to 17 respectively. Now the problem is to reduce the waist to
the finished size and obtain a whole front and back pattern without cutting
up the pattern in the process. The result must be the same in both instances.
It has also to be pointed out that the width of the skirt at the sideseams
must be reduced for a whole front and back skirt pattern. By the system
shown, the usual overlap at the sideseams is included, and the constructional
principles establish the skirt width in agreement with this factor.</p>
<p>To proceed, the front waist seam is required to agree with the distance
from X to 10 less the quantity shown at the front waist suppression from 14
to 15. Establish point 20 on the hip balance line as a pivoting point. Then
sweep an arc from 10 to 22. Measure from X to 22 equal to the previously
determined front waist measure less the front suppression. Curve the waist
seam from 15 to 22 as shown.</p>
<p>From X to 1 is 8 inches, the hip level down from the waist. The next step
is to correct the depth of the hip level at the sideseam; this is necessary
owing to the consequent raising of the side waist level by the action of
reducing the waist to the finished size. Therefore, measure down from 22 to
23 the hip level distance, 8 inches; 23 is pivoted from 3 with the pivoting
point at 20. Mark from 20 to 23 for the reconstructed hip balance line.
Previously it has been stated that, in the case of plain skirts, the
customary sideseam overlap from the hip level to the hem line is omitted, and
the sideseams are marked down square from the hip line. Therefore, to
reconstruct the skirt sideseam to agree with the elimination of the front
waist suppression, square down from 23 to 24 equal to the distance from 3 to
8 on the original draft. Referring to the original draft, we find that point
8 is not squared down from 3, for the standard sideseam overlap quantity is
included in the construction of the draft; so, by re-squaring the sideseam
with the reconstructed hip balance line, the elimination of the sideseam
overlap is effected. Shape the hem line from 7 and 21 to 24 to complete the
alteration to the front skirt and the reduction of the waist size to the
finished measure.</p>
<p>The back skirt section is treated in a similar manner. The back waist seam
is required to agree in length with the distance from 5 to 11 less the back
waist suppression from 16 to 17.</p>
<p>To proceed with the reconstruction, establish point 18 on the hip line as
a pivoting point. Next sweep an arc from 11 to 25, pivoting from 18. Measure
up the waist size from 5 to 25 equal to the predetermined distance from 5 to
11 less 16 to 17. Shape the waist seam from 5 to 16 and 25 as shown.</p>
<p>Pivoting from point 18, sweep from 3 at the side-seam to locate point 26,
8 inches from 25 as described for the front skirt construction. Mark from 18
to 26 for the reconstructed hip balance line and shape the side-seam from 25
to 26. Square down from 26 and 18 to 27 the distance from 3 to 8 for the
sideseam. Shape the hem line from 9 and 19 to 27 to complete the draft.</p>
<p>The reconstruction of the skirt pattern to provide for a whole front and
back skirt without manipulating the original basic pattern gives exactly the
same result as by manipulation and may be preferred in practice. It is not
always convenient to cut the pattern about to obtain the finished article,
and the following basic system will provide for any variation of the waist
size, and consequent skirt hem width to correspond, without the necessity for
manipulating the basic pattern.</p>

<p>The amount taken out from the waist from 10 to X, or the degree to which
the dress is required to fit, will naturally affect the amount of curve added
to the waist seams and additionally the increase of width to the sideseams,
and, therefore, the tighter the waist is required the greater will be the
curving of the waist seams and consequent addition to the skirt width at the
sideseams.</p>
<p>The preceding systems comprise the basis of all dress designing and
cutting, and practical application of the systems to the interpretation of
various typical styles will be shown in the following pages.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><a name="flared" id="flared"></a><em><a href="illust/111.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,505);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/111-t.jpg" alt="Figure 111" width="162" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig111" id="fig111"></a>Flared Skirts and Flare Effects (Fig.
111)</h3>
  <p> While at the moment skirts for day and evening wear are very close in
cut as regards the hem-line width, no doubt, in the future, skirts will once
more be full in width and flared generally.</p>
<p>The principle of adding flare and width to a skirt hem line is based upon
manipulation of the basic pattern by cutting up and opening out to obtain the
required hem-line width.</p>
<p>Fig. 111 shows the back skirt section of a dress from the waist line to
the hem with the usual back waist suppression marked to be closed out. For
the purpose of illustrating the method of flare cutting, the design
incorporates a plain hip yoke from the waist to the hip level and a plain
flared skirt appended.</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>1 from 2 = the hip level = 8 inches down from the waist.</li>
	<li>3 from 1 = the skirt length = 27 inches.</li>
	<li>4 from 2 = the half-hip measure net.</li>
	<li>5 from 3 = the distance from 2 to 4 plus 1 inch.</li>
	<li>6 from 1 = the back waist width = 2 to 4 less 1&frac14; inches.</li>
	<li>Shape the sideseam from 6 and 4 to 5 and the hem line from 5 to 3.</li>
	<li>7 from 1 = one-sixth of the half-hip measure.</li>
	<li>8 from 7 = the back waist suppression = 1&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>9 from 2 = one-sixth of the half-hip measure plus &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>Mark out the back waist suppression from 7 and 8 to 9.</li>
	<li>Shape the hip yoke from 2 to 4.
	  <ul>
	    <li>For the provision of extra width in the skirt, the pattern is cut
    through from 10, 11 and 12 to 13, 14 and 15 and opened out to allow for the
    increase of width at the hem line.</li>
      </ul>
	</li>
	</ul>
<p> Divide the skirt hem from 3 to 5 into four divisions as shown, and square
up to the hip balance line. Cut through the hip-yoke pattern from 7 and 8 to
  9 and close out the suppression as shown by the diagram. Then cut up from 10
  to 13, 11 to 14 and
12 to 15 and insert the required increase of width until the desired skirt hem
width is obtained. The shaded portions show where width has been added by
opening out the basic pattern; in this case, an increase of 3 inches takes
place at each line of opening. For extra width, the pattern may be opened to
agree with the extent of increase needed, and, if necessary additional
opening lines may be inserted to give a gradual curve to the hip line. With
regard to the shape of the hip line where it sews to the hip yoke when the
skirt has been opened out the required quantities, it will give an angular
run to the seam which is shaped in a gradual curve as indicated to give a
very even &quot;fall&quot; to the flare of the skirt.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if a skirt is desired in which the flare hangs in
distinct points instead of a gradual line, it will be necessary to retain the
shape of the hip seam as found by the opening out of the skirt without
re-curving of the waist seam. Then the skirt fullness will hang from the
hip-yoke seam in distinct points.</p>

112)</h3>
  <p> Fig. 112 illustrates the addition of flare at a low level in the skirt.
The design chosen has a panel seam from the hip level diverging towards the
centre front of the skirt and then turning back to terminate at the sideseam
below the knee level. Flare is required to be inserted in the skirt at a low
level to give a slim-skirt effect with a full hem line.</p>
<p>Fig. 112 shows the draft of the front skirt section. Points 1, 2, 3 and 4
indicate the outline; 5 from 3 for the commencement of the panel seam equals
3&frac12; inches. Shape the panel seam 14 inches towards the centre front and
then divert the seam into the side-seam at point 7, 12 inches up from the hem
line at 4 The seam from 6 to 7 is then cut through, and the pattern cut up
from three points from the hem line as shown by 8 to 11, 9 to 12, and 10 to
13. These three lines are the flaring lines and are opened out to resemble
the reconstructed skirt section as shown by the second draft. Pivoting from
point 11, 3 inches of extra width is inserted in the skirt from 8 to 8.
Pivoting from point 12, the same quantity of extra width is inserted at 9 to
9; pivoting from point 13, insert an identical amount from 10 to 10 to obtain
the reconstructed shape of the skirt from 11 to 7 and 4 to 10, 9, 8 and 2.
When the curved seam from 6 to 11, 12, 13, and 7 sews to the straight skirt
seam from 6 to 7 as shown on the first draft, a soft fluting effect in the
lower skirt section will be obtained.</p>
<p>All flares are cut by these basic principles, as are also basque effects,
frills, flared shoulder capelets, etc.</p>
<p>It is now time to commence dress pattern cutting to designs, necessarily
of simple construction at first for showing the application of the principles
of waist suppression and its consequent effect upon the design.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><a name="simple" id="simple"></a><em><a href="illust/113.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,274);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/113-t.jpg" alt="Figure 113" width="100" height="237" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig113" id="fig113"></a>A Simple Dress Design (Fig. 113)</h3>
  <p> The first example chosen has a simple line of design that is very slim
and effective in wear. The design is one that is repeated every season, and
its chief characteristics are a high waist line effect achieved by a curving
front waist seam and a slender skirt effect obtained by a panel seam
diverging from a high hip level at the sideseams.</p>
<p>The measures for the draft are as follows&#8212;</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>Chest = 32 inches.</li>
	<li>Bust = 34 inches.</li>
	<li>Waist = 25 inches (increased by 3 inches for a dress draft).</li>

	<li>Working scale = half the bust girth = 17 inches.</li>
	</ul>
<p>To draft&#8212;</p>
<p>Commence by drawing line X to X, the full length of the dress.</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>1 from X = one-third of the scale plus 1&frac12; inches for the back
depth.</li>
	<li>2 from X = the natural waist level.</li>

	<li>Square out from the above points.</li>
	<li>The width of the back neck from X to 4 = one-sixth of the scale less &frac14;

	<li>Square up from 6 to 7.</li>
	<li>8 from 3 on the hip line = the half-hip measure applied net.</li>
	<li>Square from 8 to 9, 10, and 11.</li>

	<li>18 from 7 = 1 inch on the line from 7 to 6.</li>
	<li>19 from 18 = &frac14; inch.</li>
	<li>Join 19 to 5 and hollow the shoulder seam as shown.</li>
	<li>20 from 17 = the back shoulder width from 5 to 19 less &frac14; inch.</li>
	<li>21 squared down from 20 = 1 inch. Shape the front shoulder seam from 17

	<li>Square up and down from 22 to 23, 24 and 25.</li>
	<li>Add the sideseam overlap from 25 to 26 and 27 and shape to 22.</li>

	<li>Shape the sideseams from 29 and 34 to 22 and from 30 to 33 and 22.</li>
	<li>Continue to the hem line, adding 1&frac12; inches of flare from 26 to 35
	  and
27 to 36, commencing from a point 14 inches from the hem on the overlap
sideseam lines from 22 to 26 and 27.</li>
	<li>Measure from 2 to 37 half the waist measure (28 inches) plus the
distance from 34 to 33.</li>
	<li>38 from 37 for the quantity of back waist suppression = two-thirds of
the surplus quantity shown from 37 to 9.
	  <ul>
	    <li>The first step towards the interpretation of the design is to mark
    out the necessary waist suppressions, and then mark the design to agree with
    the constructional suppression lines.</li>
      </ul>
	</li>
	<li>Mark out the back waist suppression as follows&#8212;</li>
	<li>39 from 2 = one-sixth of the half-hip measure. This quantity is variable
and must not be taken as a fixed division.</li>
	<li>40 from 39 = the back waist suppression, as shown from 37 to 38.</li>
	<li>41 from 3 for the width of the panel seams on the hip level = one-sixth
of the half-hip measure plus &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>Square down from 41 to 42 at the hem line.</li>
	<li>Mark out the back waist suppression from 39 and 40 to 41.</li>
	<li>43 from 5 = 2&frac12; inches. Mark from 39 to 43 and from 40 to 44 at the
blade level.</li>
	<li>Mark out the front waist suppression from 9 to 45 one-sixth of the
half-hip measure.</li>
	<li>46 from 45 = the quantity shown from 38 to 9.</li>
	<li>47 from 8 for the width of the front panel seam equals  the same
distance as 41 is from 3 at the back.</li>
	<li>Square down from 47 to 48 for the line of the front panel seam.</li>
	<li>Mark out the bust dart from 17 to 49 equal to the distance from 17 to
14.</li>
	<li>50 is located midway of 10 to 15.</li>
	<li>51 from 50 = 2 inches.</li>
	<li>Shape out the bust dart from 17 and 49 to 50 and 51 to join up with the
front waist suppression from 45 and 46 to 51.</li>
	<li>The termination of the skirt panel seams at the sideseams is made 3
inches down from the waist line.</li>
	<li>52 from 33 = 3 inches.</li>
	<li>53 from 34 = 3 inches.</li>
	<li>54 from 47 = 1&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>55 from 41 = 1&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>Shape from 52 to 54 and 47 and from 53 to 55 and 41.</li>
	<li>Shape the front panel seam from 47 to 56 and 57, adding 2 inches of
flare to the seams from 48 to 56 and 57.</li>
	<li>Shape the back panel seam from 41 to 58 and 59, adding 2 inches of flare
to the seams from 42 to 58 and 59.</li>
	<li>The V-neck line is made 8 inches in length from 14 to 60; join 14 to 60
and hollow &frac12; inch.
	  <ul>
	    <li>It is essential that the neck opening is not made less than 22
    inches in size all round, otherwise the wearer will find difficulty in
    getting her head through the opening.</li>
        <li>Now we come to the interpretation of the design on the draft.</li>
	    <li>The front waist seam curves to a point 6 inches above the natural waist
  line at 61 from 9, and at the sideseam is 1&frac12; inches above the waist
  line.</li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
	<li>Shape the high waist seam from 61 to 64 1&frac12; inches above 33, and where
the seam intersects the front waist suppression at 62 and 63 mark the waist
seam to intersect the suppression lines at right-angles, so that when the
waist suppression is closed out for the pattern the high waist seam will run
in one continuous line as 62 to 45 will be equal to 63 to 46.
	  <ul>
	    <li>This is the principle of applying design to all waist suppression
    lines; where the design intersects the waist suppression lines, a &quot;break&quot; is made in the line of the design to enable the design line
    to become continuous when the suppressions are taken out. If this
&quot;break&quot; was not made and the design line taken straight through the
    suppression lines, when suppression was taken out the design line would be
    broken instead of continuous.</li>
      </ul>
	</li>
	<li>56 from 34 = 1&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>Shape the high waist seam to terminate at the natural waist line at
2.</li>
	<li>66 and 67 show where the high waist seam is broken at the back waist
suppression, so that when the suppression is closed out of the skirt and the
back sections the waist seam will continue in one line.
	  <ul>
	    <li>The front has a seam through the waist from 33 to 9 to enable the
    suppression to be taken out. At the back waist, the high waist seam is
    sufficiently near the natural waist level to dispense with a through waist
    seam.</li>
      </ul>

Suppression (Fig. 114)</h3>
  <p>The manipulation of the outline pattern to eliminate the waist
suppression quantities and produce shape in the dress is illustrated by Fig.
114.</p>
<p>The back section is indicated by (a).</p>
<p>Cut up the pattern from 66 and 67 to 44 and from 44 to 43. Then, pivoting
from 44, close out the back waist suppression from 66 to 67 to open the
shoulder at 43. Re-mark the outline of the pattern after the suppression has
been closed out to agree with the outline as indicated by the solid lines
from X to 5, 43, 19, 29, 65, 67 and 2. The increase of width in the back
shoulder seam given by the closing out of the suppression makes up the usual
&frac12; inch extra width in comparison with the front shoulder seam which is
essential if a clean shoulder is desired. As the author has repeatedly
stressed, the majority of creases in shoulders are caused by neglect of this
very small detail of making.</p>
<p>The back skirt section is indicated by (b).</p>
<p>The waist suppression is shown by the dash lines from 66 and 67 to 55.</p>
<p>Close out the waist suppression by cutting through the pattern from 66 and
67 to 55 and, by pivoting from 55, close 66 to 67 to obtain the outline as
shown by points 2, 67, 65, 53, 55 and 58 to X. The flare added to the panel
seam is indicated in the diagram from 55 to 58.</p>
<p>The side panel is illustrated by (c).</p>
<p>One panel only is shown, for the front panel is made equal in shape and
size to the back. It is always advisable to aim at uniformity in design,
instead of cutting the back design a different size from that of the
front.</p>
<p>The front bodice section is illustrated by (d).</p>
<p>With this design, a bust dart through the shoulder is not required, and
provision for the bust shape is made by easing the top section into the high
waist seam either in the form of darts or by a drawing-in of the extra width
caused by the opening of the bust dart, in the form of gathers.</p>
<p>Cut through the pattern from 17 and 49 to 50 and 51 and from 63 and 62 to
51. By pivoting from 51, close out the bust dart from 17 to 49 to open the
waist seam at 62 and 63 as shown. The extra length thus obtained in the waist
seam from 60 to 62 and 64 is either darted or gathered out under the bust
prominence in the waist seam. From 14 to 60, 61, 62, 64, 30, and 21 indicates
the outline of the bodice pattern after manipulation and elimination of the
bust and waist darts.</p>
<p>The waist section is indicated by (e).</p>
<p>Close out the waist suppression from 62 to 63 and 45 to 46 to obtain the
outline shape as shown by the solid lines from points 61 to 9, 45, 33, 64,
and 62.</p>
<p>The front skirt section is indicated by (f).</p>
<p>Cut through the pattern from 45 and 46 to 54 and close out the front waist
suppression by pivoting from 54 to obtain the outline as indicated by the
points 9, 11, 57, 54, 52, 33 and 45.</p>
<p>The closing out of the waist suppressions gives the necessary curve to the
waist seams, without which it would be impossible for a dress to fit
perfectly into the waist round the curves of the figure.</p>

from Hip Level to Hem Line (Fig. 115)</h3>
<p>The following example of design illustrates a smart dress cut without a
sideseam from the hip level to the hem line. The fronts of the dress fasten
high to the throat with an opening down the centre to the bust level and are
fastened with buttons so as to enable the wearer to get into the dress. From
the bust level a yoke is marked from the front to end at the centre back, 3
inches above the natural waist line.</p>
<p>The skirt has a similar yoke design carried out in the form of a curving
seam from the centre front of the skirt, terminating in panel seams from the
hip level downwards at the back skirt. A centre front seam is shown, with an
inverted pleat inset. Pockets are inserted in the hip yoke each side, and the
skirt from the centre front to the panel seams at the back is cut in one
piece without a sideseam. This is a very slim design, for the skirt is
intended to hang straight from the hips with the inverted pleat giving the
necessary stride-room.</p>
<p>With regard to the cutting of the skirt without a sideseam, this is
achieved by first cutting the pattern in the usual way and then laying the
sideseams together and recutting in one piece. The front skirt is designed
without panel seams; so, when the waist suppression is closed out, the skirt
is opened out at the hem line. Therefore, the sideseam normal overlap must be
reduced on the outline pattern, while, at the back skirt, it is included as
usual.</p>
<p>Measures for the draft are as follows&#8212;</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>Chest = 33 inches.</li>
	<li>Bust = 35 inches.</li>
	<li>Hips = 39 inches.</li>
	<li>Waist = 27 inches, increased to 30 inches for the dress draft.</li>
	<li>Natural waist length = 15&frac14; inches.</li>
	<li>Full length = 42 inches.</li>
	<li>Half-back width = 6&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>Working scale = half the bust girth = 17&frac12; inches.</li>
	</ul>
<p>To draft&#8212;</p>
<p>Commence by drawing line X to X, the full length of the dress.</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>1 from X = the back depth = one-third of the scale plus 1&frac12;
inches.</li>
	<li>2 from X = the natural waist length = 15&frac14; inches.</li>
	<li>3 from 2 = 8 inches down for the hip level.</li>
	<li>The back neck width from X to 4 is made one-sixth of the scale less &frac14;
inch.</li>

of the Outline Pattern (Fig. 116)</h3>
<p>Fig. 116 illustrates the manipulation of the outline pattern to reduce the
waist suppressions from the draft and to cut the skirt section in one piece
without a sideseam.</p>
<p>The back is illustrated by (a).</p>
<p>Cut up the pattern from 36 and 38 to the blade at 41 and from 40 to this
point. By pivoting from 41, close out the back waist suppression from 36  to
38 to open the back shoulder seam from 40. Point 53 closes back to 54, and
the outline of the reconstructed pattern is indicated by points X to 5, 40,
19, 28, 33, 36 and 2. The high waist seam is shaped from 52 to 54 and 56,
and, though curved in appearance on the pattern as it is now drafted, when on
the figure and following the natural curves of the body it assumes a straight
line.</p>
<p>The back skirt section is illustrated by (b).</p>
<p>Cut through the pattern from 36 and 30 to 37, and, by pivoting from 37,
close out the waist suppression from 30 to 36 as shown to obtain a pattern
outline as indicated by points 2 to 36, 33, 65, 37, and 66 to X.</p>
<p>The front bodice section is illustrated by (c).</p>
<p>The reconstruction of the front bodice section is simple, as the waist
suppression and the bust dart both terminate at the dividing seam instead of
cutting through it.</p>
<p>Cut through the outline pattern from 17 and 47 to 50 and close out the
bust dart from 17 to 47 to obtain a pattern outline as 14 to 57, 58, 59, 49,
50, 48, 51, 29, and 21.</p>
<p>Cut through the waist dart from 42 and 45 to the yoke seam and close out
the suppression from 42 to 45 to obtain the pattern outline as indicated by
points 49 to 50, 48, 51, 32, 42 and 9.</p>
<p>The skirt yoke is illustrated by (d).</p>
<p>Cut through from 62 to 42 and 63 to 45 and close out the waist suppression
as shown, obtaining the outline indicated by 9 to 60, 61, 62, 64, 32, and 42.
It will be noticed that the hip-yoke seam from 61 to 62 and 64 becomes a
continuous run when the suppression is reduced, in comparison with the broken
run shown on the draft originally. A facing must be allowed from 61 to 62 and
64 for the pocket when cutting from the material.</p>
<p>The front skirt section is illustrated by (e) and (f).</p>
<p>Cut through the pattern from 62 and 63 to 43 on the hip line and up from
44 to 43. By pivoting from point 43, close out the waist suppression from 63
to 62 until the run from 62 to 61 and 64 becomes continuous. The skirt hem
width will increase from 44 to 44A, but as a reduction of width has taken
place at the sideseam by the elimination of the usual sideseam overlap, this
increase is necessary for stride-room. A pocket facing will require to be
allowed for on the hip seam from 61 to 64, equal in length to the desired
pocket mouth length.</p>
<p>To cut the front skirt in one piece with the back panel, all that is
required is the laying together of the back and front sideseams as shown.</p>

117)</h3>
<p>Fig. 117 illustrates the draft of a panelled dress design in which panel
seams at the back and front terminate on the shoulders in the armhole, and on
the skirt end in knife pleats. With a design of this character, waist
suppression can be taken out direct without any manipulation of the outline
pattern by cutting up and closing out the necessary suppressions. A
centre-front opening to the waist level is shown, fastening with buttons, and
as this cannot be allowed for in one piece with the skirt section, a seam
must be run through the waist between the two front panel seams; otherwise,
the bodice and skirt of the dress are cut through without a waist seam from
back to front.</p>
<p>Measures for the draft are as follows&#8212;</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>Chest = 36 inches.</li>
	<li>Bust = 38 inches.</li>
	<li>Waist = 29 inches, increased to 32 inches for the    dress draft.</li>
	<li>Hips = 41 inches.</li>
	<li>Natural waist length = 15&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>Full length = 44 inches.</li>
	<li>Half-back width = 6&frac34; inches.</li>
	<li>Working scale = one-third of the bust girth plus 6 inches = 18&frac34;
inches.</li>
	</ul>
<p>To draft&#8212;</p>
	<p>Commence by drawing line X to X, the full length of the dress, i.e. 46
inches.</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>1 from X = the back depth = one-third of the scale plus 1&frac12;
inches.</li>
	<li>2 from X = the natural waist length = 15&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>3 from 2 = 8 inches down for the hip level.</li>
	<li>The back neck width from X to 4 = one-sixth of the scale less &frac14;
inch.</li>
	<li>5 from 4 for the height of the back neck curve = &frac34; inch.</li>
	<li>Shape the back neck curve from 5 to X as shown.</li>
	<li>6 from 1 = the half-back width.</li>
	<li>Square up from 6 to 7 on the line squared out from X.</li>
	<li>Square out from 3 to 8 half the hip measure applied net.</li>
	<li>Square up and down from 8 to locate points 9, 10, 11 and 12.</li>
	<li>13 from 12 = one-twelfth of the scale.</li>
	<li>Square out from 13 to 14 one-sixth of the scale.
	  <ul>
	    <li>The across-chest width from 15 to 10 for all sizes of bust girth
    over 36 inches equals one-fourth of the bust measure less 1 inch.</li>
      </ul>
	</li>
	<li>16 from 15 = 2&frac34; inches for all sizes of bust girth over 36
inches.</li>
	<li>Square up from 16 to 17 equal to the distance from 10 to 13 less &frac12;
inch.</li>
	<li>18 from 7 on the line from 7 to 6 = 1 inch.</li>
	<li>19 from 18 = &frac12; inch. Shape the back shoulder seam from 19 to 5.</li>
	<li>20 from 17 = the front shoulder width = 5 to 19 less &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>Square down from 20 to 21 1 inch, and shape the front shoulder seam from
21 to 17 as shown.</li>
	<li>The sideseam is located at 22, half the distance from 3 to 8.</li>
	<li>Square up and down from 22 to 23, 24 and 25.</li>
	<li>Add the sideseam overlaps from 25 to 27 and 26, 1 inch in each instance
unless a wider skirt is desired.</li>
	<li>Measure from 10 to 28 half the bust measurement plus 1 inch.</li>
	<li>Reduce the surplus shown by 28 to 1 from the sideseams at 24 to 29 and
30</li>
	<li>31 and 32 from 23 = 29 and 30 from 24.</li>
	<li>33 from 32 = &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>34 from 31 = &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>Shape the sideseams from 29 to 34, 22 and 26 and from 30 to 33, 22 and
27.</li>
	<li>Measure from 2 to 35 half the waist measure (32 inches) plus the
distance from 34 to 33.</li>
	<li>The back waist suppression is indicated by two-thirds of the distance
from 35 to 9 in order to locate point 36.</li>
	<li>From 36 to 9 indicates the front waist suppression.</li>
	<li>The width of the panel seam at the back waist from 2 to 37 = one-sixth
of the half-hip measure.
	  <ul>
	    <li>The width of the panel seam at the hip level should be slightly
    increased to accentuate the slender effect at the waist, and &frac12; inch is
    added to the distance from 2 to 37 when deciding the width of the hip panel
    from 3 to 38.</li>
      </ul>
	</li>
	<li>When pleats are inserted in the panel seam it is advisable to spring the
panel seam out slightly from the hip line to the hem.</li>
	<li>Therefore, 39 from X = 3 to 38 plus &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>40 from 37 = the back waist suppression as indicated by the quantity
from 35 to 36.</li>
	<li>Shape out the back waist suppression from 37 and 40 to 38 and 39.</li>
	<li>41 from 6 for the termination of the panel seams in the armhole = half
the back depth from X to 1.</li>
	<li>Mark back from 41 to 42 2&frac12; inches, and lower the seam run &frac34;
inch.</li>
	<li>Shape the waist suppression from 37 to 42 and from 40 to 42, suppressing
&frac12; inch on the breast line at 43.
	  <ul>
	    <li>The width of the front panel is made identical with the width of the
    back panel. The author always advocates, when cutting an even design, having
    the back and front seam runs equal in size and shape if possible; otherwise,
    a lack of harmony and line becomes apparent. For instance, if the wearer
	      of a panelled-seam dress was at all well developed on the hips, to make
	      the back
    panels greater in width than those at the front would tend to exaggerate
	      the increase of girth rather than minimize it, whilst, by making seam
	      runs of
    equal size, the attention is focused elsewhere, and an appearance of equality
    in size at back in comparison with the front is given.</li>
      </ul>
	</li>
	<li>Therefore, from 9 to 44 equals the same distance as 2 to 37, i.e.
one-sixth of the half-hip measure.</li>
	<li>The front waist suppression from 44 to 45 = the quantity shown from 36
to 9.</li>
	<li>46 from 8 = one-sixth of the half-hip measure plus &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>47 from 11 = one-sixth of the half-hip measure plus 1 inch.</li>
	<li>Both these two measures are equal in size to the back panels.</li>
	<li>48 is midway of 15 to 10.</li>
	<li>Shape out the bust dart from 17 to 49 equal to
    14 to 17.</li>
	<li>50 from 48 = 2 inches, shape out the bust dart and the front waist
suppression from 17 to 48, 50, 44, 46 and 47 and from 49 to 50, 45, 46, and
47.</li>
	<li>51 from 48 for the diverging of the panel seam into the armhole = 3&frac12;
inches.</li>
	<li>Square across from 51 to 52, making 52 from 50 equal to 51 from 50.</li>
	<li>Shape the termination of the panel seam into the arm-hole from 52 to 53,
making 53 from 15 equal to 41 from 6.</li>
	<li>The high neck line at the front is made one-sixth of the scale down from
13 to 54. Shape the neck curve from 54 to 14.</li>
	<li>Add &frac34; inch on the front edge from 54 to 55 and an additional &frac34; inch
from 55 to 56 for the button-stand side.</li>
	<li>Square down from 55 and 56 to 57 and 58 on the waist line.</li>
	<li>The front and back knife pleats are added from nothing at the knee-level
to 3 inches in width at the hem line.</li>
	<li>59 from 47 = 17 inches.</li>
	<li>Add the pleat to the centre front and side panel by marking from 59 to
60 and 61, making each point from 47 equal to 3 inches.</li>
	<li>62 from 39 = 17 inches.</li>
	<li>Add the pleat to the centre back and side-panel seams from 62 to 63 and
64, making each point 3 inches from 39 to complete the draft.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The bust dart is closed out of the shoulder from 51 to 52 and 17 to 49 to
complete the manipulation of the pattern; otherwise, the draft is
straightforward in character. The centre back panel is cut whole from neck to
hem as also are the two side panels. A seam must be placed through the waist
from 44 to 58 to enable a centre front button fastening to terminate in the
waist line.</p>

front of the skirt.</p>
<p>The neck line is cut in at each side by two seams, permitting the neck to

  <p> No dress system would be complete without instructions on the cutting
of cowl or halter neck lines by system. This important style feature has been
in vogue for some time now and rightly so, for a draped neck line of this
character is very becoming to every woman. There are many varieties of cowl
neck lines, some draped high about the throat or low on the breast in a deep
opening. Others are twisted or looped in appearance; not strictly cowl neck
lines, yet included in the description. Cowl neck lines may either be cut in
one with the dress or inset. Sometimes, the neck line is just a triangular
piece of material inset in a deep V-point in the dress front or, at other
times, may be inset in a design or cut in one with the dress bodice. The high
cowl is most popular at the present time, especially for evening dresses, and
when cut all in one with the dress it presents difficulty to many dress
cutters.</p>
<p>Fig. 120 (a) illustrates a cowl neck line cut in one with the bodice of
the dress. A seam is placed through the waist of the dress to enable the
front of the cowl to be cut on the fold of the material. Points 1 to 8 show
the normal front pattern from the shoulders to the hip line.</p>
<p>8 from 1 equals the length of the front neck opening as desired to finish.
The next step is very simple; in fact, all cowl and draped neck line cutting
is simple, once the point is realized that there must be both an increase of
length of material in addition to more width to enable the draping effect to
take place. Whenever a draped effect is seen, it is obvious how the addition
of length and width gives the effect.</p>
<p>By pivoting from point 1, sweep from 8 to 9 until 9 and 4 are at a
right-angle. This raising of point 8 to 9 gives an increase of length to fall
and drape back to the original centre front line and also extra width from 8
to 10, which all falls softly in a drape when the front sews to the back
shoulder.</p>
<p>The author usually adds 2 inches of extra length from 9 to 11 in order to
form a turn-back to the cowl instead of a single edge. Shape from 11 to the
neck point at 1 to complete the draft. The author has cut countless numbers
of cowl neck lines in this manner and has never experienced any difficulty in
obtaining a perfect cowl by systematic cutting.</p>
<p>Fig. 120 (b) shows how the cowl is formed by cutting from 11 to 4 on the
fold of the material, preferably on the bias, as this way of the material
drapes much better. When the front neck points sew to the back shoulders at
5, it must be obvious that the material between 1 and 1 will be thrown
forward in the centre front, to drape downwards. From 1 and 1 to 4 shows the
triangle of material which many dress cutters usually insert instead of
cutting all in one with the bodice.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><a name="highcowl" id="highcowl"></a><em><a href="illust/121.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,477);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/121-t.jpg" alt="Figure 121" width="152" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig121" id="fig121"></a>The High Cowl Neck Line (Fig.
121)</h3>
  <p> The high cowl neck line is a different proposition from the low type.
It is usually cut all in one with the bodice of the dress and without
insetting at the waist seam and, in addition, the drapery is required only at
the base of the neck with elimination of any extra width across the chest.
The author has experimented with this neck line, and the only method he has
found satisfactory in practice is as follows&#8212;</p>
<p>The first essential is to obtain a whole shoulder pattern by closing out
the shoulder dart and forming an underarm bust dart. How to effect this has
been shown elsewhere, so that the reconstructed shoulder section will be
shown without any explanatory construction lines on providing the bust
dart.</p>
<p>Points 1 to 11 show the normal bodice pattern with the underarm dart
marked from 9 and 10 to 11.</p>
<p>Point A is the front pitch, &frac34; inch up from the breast line.</p>
<p>The point to bear in mind is the provision of length to form the drape at
the base of the throat only. Any extra width across the chest from A to 4 is
definitely incorrect. Therefore, to achieve this aim, the shoulder is split
up from 1 and B to A and opened out until the shoulder seam and front of the
armhole appear as shown by points 12 and 13. The amount of opening depends
upon the height of the cowl; some cowl neck lines are very close to the
throat, while others, although not as low as the previous example, are lower
in cut than the present type. In addition, with a high cowl the amount of
drapery must be reduced, as the area over which it is distributed is much
less than in the case of a low cowl. Therefore, the distance from the front
centre line to 12 is never more than 6 inches. Square back from 12 to the
front centre line at 14 and add 1 inch of extra length for the turn-back.</p>
<p>Fig. 121 (b) shows the high cowl neck-line front placed in position for
sewing to the back neck. While it will be seen that an increase of length is
apparent to ensure drapery below the neck, the width across the breast from A
to 4 and A remains unchanged.</p>
<p>To simplify cutting and obviate cutting up the pattern to reconstruct the
shoulders, points 12 and 13 may be pivoted from the front pitch A to

determine their correct positions, and the front of the arm-hole and the
front shoulder re-marked as shown. This cowl is cut all in one with the
bodice and skirt of the dress as the centre front line remains in a
continuous straight line.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><a name="insetcowl" id="insetcowl"></a><em><a href="illust/122.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,487);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/122-t.jpg" alt="Figure 122" width="156" height="194" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig122" id="fig122"></a>The Inset Cowl Neck Line (Fig.
122)</h3>
<p>Inset cowls should always be cut on the bias of the material; otherwise,
the draping properties of the neck line will be diminished.</p>
<p>These cowls may be either a triangular piece of material set in the bodice
in a point or some form of design. In any case, the same principles of
construction are applied.</p>
<p>In Fig. 122 (a) points 1 to 10 illustrate the normal forepart draft with a
V-neck opening. An inset cowl is required in the design and is marked from 11
to 12 and from 12 to 2 and 3 for the accommodation of the bust dart. The
fronts are cut whole with the centre front edge from 11 to 9 and 8 downwards
on the fold of the material. Then proceed by pivoting from 1 and 10, and
sweep 10 to 13 until 1, 13 and 11 are forming a right-angle.</p>
<p>Mark up from 13 to 14 2 inches and shape the top edge run of the cowl neck
line. The line from 1 to 2, 12, 11, and 14 forms the inset cowl. The cowl may
be incorporated with variations of the bodice design or from a high waist
line run and, in all instances, the constructional principles are applied as
described above.</p>
<p>Fig. 122 (b) shows how the cowl is formed by the sewing together of the
back and front neck points.</p>

123)</h3>
<p>The design chosen for the following draft has many points of technical
interest for the cutter. In the first instance, the skirt is perfectly plain
in character, yet required to be a perfect fit at the waist. To this end, the
skirt is drafted separately from the bodice in a finished shape without the
necessity for manipulation of the pattern to obtain suppression at the
waist.</p>
<p>The bodice has a cowl neck line cut in one with the fronts, and a seam
runs from the shoulder to the bust and diverges to the sideseam above the
waist line, to be repeated on the back in a similar manner.</p>
<p>Measures for the draft are as follows&#8212;</p>

of the Pattern (Fig. 124)</h3>
<p>The reconstruction of the bodice pattern for the provision of waist
suppression and designing of the back shoulder seam is carried out in the
following manner&#8212;</p>
<p>The back pattern is illustrated by Fig. 124 (a).</p>
<p>Cut the back waist-suppression lines from 25 and 26 to 34 and from 33 on
the back shoulder seam to the same point. Recut the pattern by closing out
the waist suppression from 25 to 26 by pivoting from 34 and opening the
shoulder seam from 33 &frac14; inch. Mark round the pattern to obtain the outline
as X to 5, 33, 16, 19, 22, 25, and 2.</p>
<p>When the pattern has been recut, mark the seam design to agree with that
of the fronts.</p>
<p>38 from 22 = the same distance as 32 is from 21.</p>
<p>Mark up from 38 to 39 6 inches, making 39 from the shoulder seam equal in
length to 30 from 14 at the front.</p>
<p>The termination of the seam in the shoulder is indicated by point 40,
which is located at the same distance from 16 as 14 is from 18.</p>
<p>Shape from 38 to 39 and 40.</p>
<p>Fig. 124 (b) illustrates the front bodice.</p>
<p>To reconstruct the front bodice pattern, cut through the bust dart from 31
and 14 to 30 and close out the dart to obtain the pattern outline as
indicated by the solid lines from 30 to 32, 19, 18, 14, and 11.</p>
<p>Cut through the waist suppression from 27 and 28 to 30 and close out the
dart to obtain the outline pattern as shown by the solid line from 14 to 11,
37, 8, 28, 21, 32, and 30.</p>
<p>The pattern outline is cut through from 30 to 14 to form the shoulder seam
design and to enable the cowl front from 37 to 8 to be cut on the bias of the
material.</p>
<p>It would not be a bad plan to cut the skirt sections on the bias to agree
with the bodice if a patterned material is used; in any case, it is essential
to cut the cowl on the direct bias.</p>
<p>The skirt back and front sections do not require any special manipulation
for waist suppression. The system gives the outline pattern in a finished
shape with provision for contour capacity infused direct.</p>

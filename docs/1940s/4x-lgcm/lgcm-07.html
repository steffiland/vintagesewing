  <p>  THE system used for drafting long-coat patterns is identical in constructional
  points with the short-coat basis with the exception of increased armhole size,
  a slightly wider sleeve and additional ease if the garment is required for
  special purposes.</p><p>
  Design in long coats may be divided into two sections, the &quot;dressy&quot; type
  of town coat, lavishly trimmed with fur and elaborately designed, and the strictly
  tailored styles comprising plain panelled coats, heavier belted ulster wrap
  coats in nap or camel-hair cloth, and loose-fitting garments of the raglan
  and drop-shoulder type.</p>
  <p>
  The &quot;dressy&quot; styles are usually worn over a dress and may be closer
  in fit than the other type, which may on some occasions serve as a covering
  for a costume, therefore necessitating an addition of size for the needed roomier
  accommodation, though all women seem to expect a coat sufficiently easy to
  enable them to wear a cardigan or short jacket underneath in the cold weather.
  The &quot;tailored&quot; long coat of the old days has very nearly disappeared&#8212;at
  any rate, among the trade catering for the younger generation&#8212;except
  in the sense that &quot;tailored&quot; is more a description of the workmanship
  than a delineator of style. To-day, design is all-important, not fussy trimming
  effect, but design that has line and emphasizes the good points of the figure.
  The old conception of a &quot;tailored coat&quot; was something after the style
  of an elongated costume jacket, yet to-day the younger generation are critical
  of stereotyped designs and enthusiastic over new ideas. They demand originality
  of style and are quick to appreciate line and good cutting, even if the design
  is restrained in character. A severe line, well cut, is considerably more flattering
  to the wearer than a style overburdened with fancy strappings and trimmings
  that are the &quot;latest&quot; fashion. A greater effect can be achieved by
  simple means than by elaboration; a perfect fit needs no intricate designing
  in order to attract notice.</p>
  <p>
  Women generally do not mind a severe or plain design as long as there is some
  redeeming feature such as ultra-modern lapels, an original front fastening
  or a sleeve with an original cut. To-day they are catered for as never before;
  the interest in sports has introduced a new element into line. Special clothes
  for spectators at sports meetings have a &quot;line&quot; and style all their
  own, very suitable to the young, and flattering to the women of advancing years.</p>
  <p>
  It is not proposed to illustrate many designs in this chapter, only the styles
  that are sure of being repeated every year and remain static in design.</p><p>
  The first design will be a plain panelled coat with heavy lapels and a deep
  collar. Slanting pockets are placed on the hips, and the fronts fasten with
  three buttons. The length may either be full length or seven-eighths; the latter
  length is the more fashionable at the moment.</p>

  <p> Fig. 46 shows a useful draft with a sidebody seam under the arms and plain
  fronts with a shoulder dart terminating at the bust point. A wide wrap-over
  is provided at the fronts, and the lapel is a suitable shape for adapting to
  a fur collar.</p><p>
  The draft is arranged for a figure of increased hip girth over normal proportion.</p><p>
  Full measures are as follows&#8212;</p>
  <ul class="small">
    <li>
    Chest = 40 inches. </li>
    <li>Bust = 42 inches. </li>
    <li>Waist = 32 inches. </li>

    <li> Working scale = one-third of the bust girth plus 6 inches = 20 inches.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  To draft&#8212;</p>
  <p>Commence by drawing line X to X, the full length of the coat,
    i.e. 46 inches.</p>
  <ul class="small">
    <li>
    1 from X = one-third of the scale plus 1&frac34; inches.</li>

    <li> 10 from 9 = one-twelfth of the scale.</li>
    <li> 11 from 10 = one-sixth of the scale.</li>
    <li> 12 from 8 = one-fourth of the bust girth less &frac34; inch.</li>
    <li> 13 from 12 = 3 inches always for all sizes of bust over
  36 inches.</li>
    <li> Square up from 13 to 14 equal to 8 to 10 less &frac12; inch. </li>
    <li>15 is midway
        6 to 12. </li>
    <li>Square up from 15 to 16 one-third of the scale plus
  &frac14; inch.</li>
    <li> Join 16 to 5 and 14. </li>
    <li>17 is located where the line from 16 to 5 is intersected
  by the line from 6 to 7.</li>
    <li> 18 from 17 = &frac12; inch. Shape the back shoulder seam
  from 18 to 5 as shown.</li>
    <li> 19 from 14 = 5 to 18 less &frac12; inch.</li>
    <li> Shape the scye from 19 to 18, hollowing &frac12; inch below the breast line
    to 20 and 21 from 6 and 12.</li>
    <li> Square down from 8 to 22.</li>
    <li> 23 from 22 = &frac14; inch.</li>
    <li> Mark the centre front line from 8 to 23, 24 and 25.</li>
    <li> Square down from 15 to 26, 27, and 28.</li>
    <li> 29 and 30 from 26 are each 3/8 inch respectively.
      <ul>
        <li> The hip disproportion over the normal equals 2 inches or 1 inch
          on the draft; therefore, of this quantity, two-thirds are added at
          the sideseams
          and one-third
        at the back panel.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li> Overlap at 27 the usual normal 1&frac12; inches plus two-thirds of 1
      inch, say 5/8 inch,
    totalling 2 1/8 inches in all.</li>
    <li> 31 from 27 and 32 from 27 are each 1 inch.</li>
    <li> 33 from 28 = 27 to 32 plus 1&frac12; inches.</li>
    <li> 34 from 28 = 31 to 27 plus 1&frac12; inches.</li>
    <li> Shape the sideseams from 15 to 30, 31 and 34 and from 15 to 29, 32 and
    33.</li>
    <li> 35 from 2 = half the waist measure plus 2&frac34; inches.</li>
    <li> 36 from 6 = 2 inches.</li>
    <li> 37 from 2 = one-third of the scale less &frac34; inch.</li>
    <li> 38 from 3 = 2 to 37 plus &frac12; inch.</li>
    <li> 39 from X = 2 to 37 plus 1 inch.</li>
    <li> Shape the sidebody seam from 36 to 37, 38 and 39.</li>
    <li> 40 from 37 = two-thirds of the waist surplus shown at 35 to 22.
      <ul>
        <li> As one-third of the hip increase is placed at the back panel, the
          usual &frac14; inch suppression becomes an overlap of 1/8 inch.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li> 42 from 39 = 1 inch.</li>
    <li> Shape the sidebody seam from 36 to 40, 41 and 42.</li>
    <li> 43 is midway 12 to 8.</li>
    <li> 44 from 14 = &frac12; inch. Join 44 to 43 and pivot to 45 equal
  to 14 to 11 for the bust dart. </li>
    <li>46 from 10 = one-sixth of the scale. Shape
        the neck
  curve from 46 to 11 as shown.</li>
    <li> Add 4 inches at 47 for the front edge overlap, and line from 47 down
    the fronts.</li>
    <li> 48 from 25 = &frac34; inch. Shape the bottom edge run from
  48 to 34.</li>
    <li> 49 from 11 = 1 inch. Mark the crease line of the lapel
  to 47.</li>
    <li> 50 from 11 = 2 inches. Line through 46 to 51.</li>
    <li> 51 from 46 = 4 &frac12; inches or the desired width of the lapel. </li>
    <li>Shape
        from 51 to 47 to complete the draft.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  It will be noticed that the front dart has been eliminated as it is not essential
  for a wrap style.</p>
  <p>
  Just in case the principle of applying the increase of hip girth is not understood,
  we should bear in mind that a normal increase of girth is 4 inches, and therefore
  for every 1 inch increase on the draft two-thirds is placed at the sideseams
  and one-third at the back panel or sidebody seams.</p>

  <p> The Double-breasted chesterfield style as depicted by Fig. 47 may be fairly classed
    as a standard ladies' garment.</p>
  <p>
  Unlike many designs introduced for women every season, it is one that with
  very slight variation is repeated in fashion more often than any other wrap
    coat.</p>
    <p>
  In line and construction, the outlines are identical with those of its masculine
  counterpart with adaptation to the requirements of the feminine figure.</p><p>
  A centre back seam is included, with the sideseam placed at the back scye and
  the hip overlap wedged in at the original location of this increment. Provision
  for the bust shape is made by a dart in the gorge under the lapel.</p><p>
  The full measures are as follows&#8212;</p>
  <ul class="small">
    <li>
    Chest = 32 inches.</li>
    <li> Bust = 34 inches.</li>
    <li> Waist = 25 inches.</li>

    <li> Working scale = half the bust girth = 17 inches.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  To draft&#8212;</p>
  <p>Commence by drawing line from X to X equal to the full length of the
      coat, 45 inches.</p>
  <ul class="small">
    <li> 1 from X = the back depth = one-third of the scale
  plus 1&frac34; inches.</li>

    effect
    achieved
    by
  the front and back panel seams diverging at angles into the armhole. Slanting
  jeatted pockets are shown, with a dart for the waist shape above.</p>

  and a front panel running from the front of the scye to the hem.</p><p>
  The author recently cut a coat to this design and the draft is an exact reproduction
  of his pattern. The garment had a very slim line, and fitted perfectly without
  any alteration. On the original, a collarless neck line was included in the
  design, but, alternatively, a scarf, stand or &quot;Prussian&quot; collar may
  be added.</p><p>

  <p>
  The front waist suppression is taken from the panel for preference as the design
  is not suited in line to the introduction of a dart under the bust. Though
  practically all the designs shown have a waist dart, this is by no means compulsory
  in the position indicated. The author does not, in practice, believe in suppressing
  the front panel seam, as this operation tends to disturb the balance and fit
  of the fronts. He would much rather omit the front waist suppression altogether
  if the dart he advocates could not be used. But after all, the finished effect
  is what we are interested in, and so darts should be used whenever possible.</p>

Suppression (Fig. 52)</h3>
  <p> Fig. 52 shows how the pattern is split up and manipulated
    to create the extra
  length at the side-seams, which enables the garment to fit round the &quot;bends&quot; of
  the figure. As stated previously, if a fitting coat is desired, waist suppression
  must be taken out in similar proportion to that of a panelled-coat draft, even
  if the design is without panel or sidebody seams.</p>
  <p>
  We mark on the pattern the suppressions that are needed and then endeavour
  to fit the design to them. In this instance, the panel seam from the waist
    downwards permits of the usual waist suppression, but, above, the back is
    cut in one
    piece without seams of
  any description; so first the width of the panel seams apart is determined,
  and then the standard amount of suppression in accordance with the requirements
  of the figure is marked out, as 36 to 39 on the draft in Fig. 51. That suffices
    for the skirt section below the waist line, the above-waist section being
  ignored for the moment.</p>
  <p>
  The panel seams are then continued above the waist line to the shoulders in
  the usual way. These are invisible suppression lines and not seams. They indicate
  the amount of suppression to be taken out to make the above-waist section agree
  with the below-waist section. We cannot take out seams, so the pattern is split
    up from 36 and 39 to 44, the point where on a panel draft the waist suppression
  disappears, and from 42 at the back shoulder to 44.</p>
  <p>
  The suppression 36 to 39 is then closed out, pivoting from 44, and the back
  pattern re-marked as shown by the solid construction lines in Fig. 52 (a).
  A similar effect is now gained by taking out a panel seam to the waist, and
    the lowering of points 15 and 29 is in accordance with the principles of
    waist
  suppression described in <a href="lgcm-04.html">Chapter IV</a>.</p>
  <p>
  It will be seen that the back shoulder seam has increased slightly in length.
  This is not a fault; extra length for easing to the front shoulder is essential
  for a clean-fitting shoulder, so this result of the pattern manipulation may
  be discounted.</p><p>
  Fig. 52 (b) shows the manipulation of the front pattern to produce a whole
  shoulder and the customary waist suppression. As the shoulder is required without
  a bust dart and there is no possibility of a gorge dart when the fronts button
  up without a collar, we must resort to the underarm dart as a means of providing
  bust provision.</p><p>
  Therefore, the shoulder dart from 55, 54 to 53 and the waist dart from 56 to
  53 have to be eliminated and transferred to the underarm dart.</p><p>
  Split the pattern from 55 and 54 to 53 and from 53 to 60. Close 55 to 54, pivoting
  from 53, which causes 53 to 60 to open. Re-mark the new shoulder and scye shape
  as shown, then split up the pattern from 56 to 53 and close out the waist suppression.
  The bust dart will then open to 61. Mark two seams inside 60 and 61 and shape
  the bust dart to 62, 4 inches from the sideseam.</p><p>
  Fig. 52 (c) indicates the process of altering the skirt to agree with the need
  for waist suppression. The waist seam must be equal in length to sew to 30
  and 51, so the suppression at 57 is closed out by splitting up the skirt pattern
  from 57 to 58 and from 59 to 58. If the slight increase in the quantity of
  material in the skirt is deemed unnecessary, reduce the sideseams back to 34
  after the waist dart has been pleated out, and check up the length of the sideseams
  to agree with 30 to 34.</p><p>
  The operation of splitting up the pattern and closing out the necessary suppressions
  achieves in a block design the same fitting results as the insertion of seams,
  even though the processes involved may appear &quot;unscientific.&quot; But
  science has not the elasticity to cope with all the demands of design; at times
  a somewhat more effective and practical knowledge is needed to apply the science
  rationally to pattern designing. Science tells us that such overlap and suppression
  are necessary, yet does not or cannot lay down concrete ways and means of applying
  these factors. The abler a cutter becomes, the less he adheres to static rules
  of cutting. He keeps in his mind the fundamental requirements of the system
  to produce a good-fitting garment and operates until the finished pattern has
  incorporated therein all the knowledge that scientific principles and practical
  modelling have taught.</p>
  <p>
  We cannot always cut our coats with panel seams; if we could, cutting would
  be less of difficulty and more of monotony. The constantly changing designs
  in the fashion world keep the brain keen and alert, while always endeavouring
  to fit designs to definite suppression factors teaches us that system is too
  rigid to be more than a basis for commencement. The basis drafts lay down definite
  points which always have to be adhered to, though the methods of doing so differ
  with practically every varying design, and any attempt to systematize these
    methods is doomed to failure by the very prolificacy of fashion styles. All
    we can do is to master the general methods of approach
  and keep in mind the ever-present need of waist suppression at the back and
  front to create an additional amount of sideseam length, without which the
  fit of any garment is impossible.</p>

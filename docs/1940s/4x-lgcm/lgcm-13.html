</p>
<p>THE construction of collar patterns is governed by the shape and type of
collar required, the length of the lapel turn, the measurement of the neck
circumference of the coat gorge, and lastly the necessity or otherwise for
manipulation by shrinking and stretching in making.</p>
<p>The necessity for manipulation can be diminished if the collar is cut to
agree with the particular shape and size of the gorge run to which it is
required to sew. In the majority of instances where collars require an
excessive amount of manipulation the fault is due to the practice of leaving
collar cutting either to the tailor or tailoress, who cannot be expected to
have practical knowledge of adjusting the shape of the collar to agree with
differently shaped neck curves and usually adapts one standard collar pattern
for every coat. Collars should be cut when the coat is cut, and not at some
later time.</p>
<p>The standard tailored collars for ladies' coats are the Step Collar, the
Double-Breasted Collar, the Double-Breasted Ulster or Storm Collar, the Stand Collar, the Stand-up
Storm Collar, sometimes called the Broadway Collar, and, for loose-fitting
raglans or swagger coats, the Circular or Prussian Collar.</p>
<p>There are two points to note with regard to the effect of the length of
the lapels on collar construction. If a low-turning lapel is required, the
collar will need less length of &quot;fall&quot; edge than in the case of a
high-turning lapel.</p>
<p>As the turn of the lapels becomes higher and closer to the neck, the
necessity for length at the fall edge of the collar increases until the
maximum is reached with the circular Prussian collar.</p>
<p>The step collar is so-called because the distance the collar-end is from
the end of the lapel forms a &quot;step&quot; and may be from 1&frac14; to 1&frac12; inches
in any single-breasted coat.</p>
<p>The stand of the collar is that part which fills up the neck of the coat
to the desired height. Owing to the shape of the neck it is not possible to
add this extension satisfactorily to the coat back neck curve, though many
designs at the moment are showing the collar and coat cut in one. The height
of the stand depends on the shape of the neck and varies with long- or
short-necked figures from 1&frac12; inches in the first instance to &frac34; inch in
the latter.</p>
<p>The fall of the collar is that part which falls over or turns back from
the edge of the stand down over the shoulders. The width of the fall is
governed by the type of collar and by the distance traversed by the fall edge
over the shoulders. At a certain width of collar fall, a similar distance
round the upper shoulders is covered, and consequently the wider the fall the
correspondingly greater the distance over the shoulders covered by the fall
edge. The author always takes a check measure of the shoulders where the
collar edge will lay when sewn to the neck as a guide to the length of fall
edge required in the collar. This can be easily accomplished by marking the
shape of the lapel on the shoulder of the coat, measuring round the shoulders
from the step of the lapels to the centre back seam of the coat at a distance
down estimated by calculating the stand height up from the back neck curve,
and then measuring down the length of fall.</p>
<p>The crease edge of the collar is the line or edge where the collar stand
becomes the fall by being creased over to run with the crease line of the
lapel. Though it is the general practice to mark the crease line of the
collar when it is cut, this line does not always tally with the crease line
of the lapel, and consequently readjustment of the crease lines is needed to
make a continuous run. The author always makes a point of not creasing the
collar until it is sewn to the neck, and then he marks a crease line to agree
with the lapel crease.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a name="step" id="step"></a><em><a href="illust/164.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,303);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/164-t.jpg" alt="Figure 164" width="100" height="212" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig164" id="fig164"></a>The Step Collar, giving the Basic Principles
of Collar Construction (Fig. 164)</h3>
<p>Fig. 164 shows the forepart of a single-breasted coat with a lapel turning
  to fasten
at the waist line.</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>The step of the lapel is 1&frac14; inches.</li>
	<li>The stand height is 1 inch.</li>
	<li>The fall depth is 1&frac34; inches.</li>
	<li>Point 1 is the commencement of the lapel turn at the waist line.</li>
	<li>2 is the front neck point.</li>
	<li>3 from 2 = the stand height = 1 inch as established  in the coat basis
draft.</li>
	<li>Rule the crease line of the lapel from 1 through 3 to 4.</li>
	<li>4 from 3 = the width of the back neck curve plus &frac14; inch.
	  <ul>
	    <li>The addition of &frac14; inch to the back neck width obviates any tendency
	      of the collar to come up short in the sewing to the neck curve, and provides
	      for
    a certain quantity of length for easing in round the gorge between the crease
    of the lapel and the neck point.</li>
      </ul>
	</li>
	<li>Point 5 is located where the crease line of the lapel cuts through the
gorge.</li>
	<li>Pivoting from 5, sweep from 4 to 6 &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>Shape the crease of the collar from 5 to 6 in a straight line.
	  <ul>
	    <li>The crease is marked in a straight line because the old saying that &quot;a straight line is the shortest distance between two points&quot; is
    very applicable to the construction of collar patterns, as the crease edge
	      of the collar must be kept as short as possible, which can only be achieved
	      by
    drafting this line straight.</li>
      </ul>
	</li>
	<li>Square back from 6 to 7 the stand height plus one seam, i.e. 1&frac14; inches.
	  <ul>
	    <li>If the under-collar is felled to the coat, there will be no need to
    make the addition for seaming, and the collar stand must be cut to finished
    width.</li>
      </ul>
	</li>
	<li>By line 5 to 6, square up from 6 to 8 the fall depth plus &frac14; inch, i.e.
2 inches.
	  <ul>
	    <li>The addition is made for a seam round the fall edge, though, in most
    instances, the author always cuts the collar slightly wider than the required
    width to allow for the slight narrowing of the collar under manipulation,
	      and to give the worker a fair chance to turn out a well-shaped fall.</li>
      </ul>
	</li>
	<li>9 from 8 = &frac12; inch. Shape from 9 to 6.</li>
	<li>10 is the end of the lapel.</li>
	<li>11 from 10 = the length of the step plus a &frac14;-inch seam to be reduced
from the lapel edge, i.e. 1&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>12 from 11 = the fall end of the collar = &frac14; inch from 11 to allow for
the reduction of a seam in making.
	  <ul>
	    <li>Therefore, from the above, the principle for step or stand collars
    is to measure back from the edge of the lapel the required length of step,
    which automatically allows for a seam to be reduced from both lapel and
    collar ends, resulting in the finished step length being identical with the
    preliminary length marked.</li>
      </ul>
	</li>
	<li>13 from 12 = two seams, one to be reduced from the collar and one from
the lapel gorge.</li>
	<li>14 from 5 = two seams.</li>
	<li>Shape the sewing edge of the collar from 13 to 14 and 7.</li>
	<li>15 from 13 = the width of the collar fall edge at the step plus two
seams, i.e. 1&frac14; inches plus &frac12; inch = 1&frac34; inches.</li>
	<li>Shape the fall edge from 15 to 9 to complete the shape.</li>
	</ul>
<p>This draft represents the foundation collar system from which all
adjustments for Double-breasted collars, short lapel turns and deeper falls are made.</p>
<p>Very often the under-collar is made of a thin melton to enable the collar
to be felled to the gorge on the raw edge for thinness. This is the method
adopted in the best class of trade, but, in the author's opinion, this
procedure is not essential if the collar is properly cut and seamed to the
coat. If a melton is used, a seam must be reduced from the sewing edge from
13 to 14 and 7, the stand being made a 1 inch finished width to fell over a
small inlay left on round the back and front gorge curve. It is the leaving
of this inlay to which the author objects, for it is the source of many
shoulder creases and defects when workers persist in sewing out shoulders and
inlay in one run, instead of ceasing the seam of the shoulder at the
commencement of the inlay.</p>

<p>Fig. 165 shows the reproduction of a collar suitable for double-breasted lapels and
turn. The lapel turns to a low fastening at the waist, and the gorge is cut
without a V cut.</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>Point 1 is the end of the lapel crease line.</li>
	<li>2 is the front neck point.</li>
	<li>3 from 2 = the stand height = 1 inch.</li>
	<li>Mark through the lapel crease line from 1 to 3 and 4.</li>
	<li>4 from 3 = the back neck width plus &frac14; inch.</li>
	<li>5 is located where line 1 to 3 intersects the gorge run from 2 to the
step of the lapel.</li>
	<li>Pivoting from 5, sweep from 4 to 6 &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>Shape the crease edge of the collar from 5 to 6 in a straight line.</li>
	<li>Square back from 6 to 7 by line 5 to 6 the stand height plus a &frac14; inch
seam, i.e. 1&frac14; inches.</li>
	<li>Square up from 6 to 8 the fall depth plus a &frac14; inch seam, i.e. 2
inches.</li>
	<li>Spring out &frac12; inch from 8 to 9, and shape from 9 to 6 and 7 for the
centre seam of the collar.</li>
	<li>10 is the commencement of the lapel peak.</li>
	<li>11 from 10 = the length of the peak.</li>
	<li>12 from 10 = two seams, i.e. &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>14 from 5 = two seams, i.e. &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>Shape from 12 to 14 and 7.</li>
	<li>13 from 11 = &frac34; inch and two seams below the edge of the lapel
peak.</li>
	<li>From 12 to 13 is made two seams below the lapel peak, so that when a
seam is reduced from the lapel from 10 to 11 and a seam from 12 to 13, the
finished shape of the collar and lapel will meet edge to edge at 12 to
13.</li>
	<li>The short distance down from 10 to 15 illustrates where the lapel peak
  is nipped in for turning out the collar and lapel, and, when seams are
  reduced from the collar and gorge, point 15 will be the corner of the lapel
  and collar.</li>
</ul>
	<h3 class="clear"><a name="ulster" id="ulster"></a><em><a href="illust/166.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,339);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/166-t.jpg" alt="Figure 166" width="106" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig166" id="fig166"></a>The Double-Breasted Ulster or Storm Collar (Fig.
166)</h3>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>Height of the collar stand = 1 inch.</li>
	<li>Depth of the fall = 3&frac12; inches.</li>
	</ul>
<p>The need for an additional amount of length round the fall edge of the
collar where it covers the shoulders is greater as the fall width becomes
wider, and, to allow for this extra length, the crease line of the collar
from 5 to 4 must be deflected or bent further back to lengthen the fall edge.
As a guide to the amount of bending of the crease line, subtract the stand
height, 1 inch, from the required fall depth, 3&frac12; inches, giving a residue
of 2&frac12; inches, which represents the diverging of the crease line from
the straight for the specified fall depth to allow for sufficient edge length
to
lie smoothly over the upper shoulders.</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>Point 1 is the commencement of the lapel turn.</li>
	<li>2 is the front neck point.</li>
	<li>3 from 2 = the collar stand height = 1 inch.</li>
	<li>4 locates the intersection of the crease line joining 1 to 3 with the
gorge run from 2 to the peak of the lapels.</li>
	<li>Rule the crease line up from 1 and 4 through 3 to 5.</li>
	<li>5 from 3 = the back neck width plus &frac14; inch.</li>
	<li>By pivoting from point 4, sweep back from 5 to 6 the difference between
the stand height and the fall depth, i.e. 2&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>Join 4 to 6 in a straight line for the crease of the collar.</li>
	<li>By line 4 to 6, square back from 6 to 7 the stand height plus &frac14; inch,
i.e. 1&frac14; inches.</li>
	<li>By line 4 to 6, square up from 6 to 8 the fall depth plus a seam, i.e. 3&frac34; inches.</li>
	<li>Spring out from 8 to 9 &frac34; inch, and shape the centre seam of the collar
from 9 to 6 and 7.</li>
	<li>10 is the commencement of the peak of the lapel and the end of the
gorge.</li>
	<li>11 is the end of the lapel peak.</li>
	<li>12 is &frac34; inch, or to taste, back from 11 and two seams below the line
of the lapel from 11 to 10.</li>
	<li>13 from 10 = &frac12; inch. Shape from 13 to 12 and the fall collar edge from
12 to 8 and 9.</li>
	<li>14 from 4 = &frac12; inch. Shape the collar stand from 13 to 14 and 7 to
complete the draft.</li>
	</ul>
<p>The collar shape drafted allows for the end of the collar to meet flush
with the lapel peak when made up. The same construction applies for other
types of ulster collar which show a gap between the end of the collar and the
lapel peak at 11 and 12.</p>

the Length of Fall Required (Fig. 167)</h3>
<p>To estimate the actual length of collar fall edge required to agree with
varying fall depths, it is necessary to measure on the actual shoulders of
the coat where the collar edge will lie and then transfer this measurement to
the collar draft. Fig. 167 shows the drafting of an ulster collar by this
method.</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>Point 1 is the position of the turn at the top button.</li>
	<li>2 is the front neck point.</li>
	<li>3 is the usual collar stand width, 1 inch.</li>
	<li>4 is located where the crease line from 1 to 3 intersects the gorge run
from 2 to the commencement of the lapel peak.</li>
	<li>The back of the coat is shown by dash lines and numbered from 5 at the
centre back neck to 6, the shoulder seam and 7 at the shoulder end.</li>
	<li>The back is laid in position against the front shoulder so that 6 and 2
are touching, and 7 overlaps the front shoulder by &frac14; inch.</li>
	<li>8 is the end of the gorge run from 2 and 4.</li>
	<li>9 from 8 = the length of the lapel peak.</li>
	<li>Mark the shape of the lapel and gorge run on the shoulder part of the
coat as indicated by 8A and 9A.</li>
	<li>The fall depth is 3&frac12; inches; therefore, measure down from 5 to 10
this quantity less the stand height of 1 inch, i.e. 2&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>Similarly, 11 from 2 and 6 = 2&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>12 back from 9A = the width of the collar fall at the lapel end = &frac34;
inch.</li>
	<li>The distance from 12 to 11 and 10 represents the length of the collar
fall edge in the finished collar draft.</li>
	<li>13 from 3 = the back neck width from 6 to 5 plus &frac14; inch.</li>
	<li>By pivoting from 4, sweep from 13 to 14 equal to the distance from 5 to
10.</li>
	<li>Square back from 14 to 15 the stand height plus &frac14; inch, i.e. 1&frac14;
inches.</li>
	<li>16 from 4 = &frac12; inch or two seams.</li>
	<li>17 down from 8A = &frac12; inch or two seams.</li>
	<li>18 from 12 = &frac12; inch or two seams.</li>
	<li>Square out from 14 to 19 the fall depth plus &frac14; inch, i.e. 3&frac34;
inches.</li>
	<li>Apply the length from 12, 11 and 10 from 12 less &frac12; inch to locate the
position of 20 above 19.</li>
	<li>Shape the fall edge of the lapel from 18 and 12 to 19 and 20.</li>
	<li>Shape the stand edge of the collar from 18 to 17, 16 and 15 to complete
the shape of the ulster collar.</li>
	</ul>
<p>The collar will require a slight amount of straining with an iron where it
lies over the shoulder seams; otherwise, the outside fall edge length is
sufficient for the requirement of covering the shoulders of the coat at the
collar depth stated.</p>

<p>Fig. 168 illustrates the draft of a roll or shawl collar. The under-collar
is cut in the usual manner, but, in place of the usual top-collar, the facing
is carried right round to the back neck and seamed down the centre back to
form the top-collar and the facing in one. As the collar seams at the gorge
do not show, the shape of the gorge may be varied from the basic draft
instructions and lowered from the crease line to the lapel edge, so
facilitating the sewing together of the collar and lapel.</p>

169)</h3>
<p>The ulster stand or &quot;Broadway&quot; collar is a rather difficult
collar to cut, for, being required to stand up at the back neck and curve
round to lie flat on the shoulders at the front, the necessity for a great
deal of length round the fall edge is apparent.</p>
<p>The collar described fulfils all the requirements stated and is
recommended for the ulster type of coat. A collar constructed on the usual
storm-collar lines would not remain standing at the back owing to
insufficient length of fall edge, and would curl over in wear.</p>

    <p>The vogue of loose-fitting and swagger coats has introduced the
high-closing circular neck line to the majority of women. These coats usually
have a round collar of either Prussian or flat, circular type. The Prussian
collar, as its name implies, is designed on uniform lines to stand up on the
neck with a circular fall of 2 or more inches, whilst the circular collar,
sometimes called the &quot;Peter Pan&quot; collar, is not cut with a stand
and simply lies flat round the neck and shoulders. Many juvenile coats are
shown with collars of this type. The first essential is to fill up the neck
opening of the coat &frac12; inch at the back and sides.</p>
<p>Take the back and forepart patterns and lay the shoulder seams together,
overlapping 1 inch at the shoulder end between points 2 to 4.</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>Points 1 and 3 are identical.</li>
	<li>5 is the centre of the front at the neck opening.</li>
	<li>Fill up the neck of the coat &frac12; inch from X to A, 1 and 3 to B,
tapering away to nothing at 5.</li>
	<li>Mark down from 5 to 6 the depth of the collar fall at the centre front,
i.e. 2&frac14; inches.</li>
	<li>8 from A = the depth of the collar at the centre back plus two seams = 2&frac14; inches.</li>
	<li>7 from B = the width of the collar at the shoulder seams = 2&frac14;
inches.</li>
	<li>Shape the collar edge from 5 to 6 and 6 to 7 and 8.</li>
	<li> Cut this collar on the fold of the material from A to 8 and with the
bias at 7 where the collar passes over the shoulders to the front.</li>
	</ul>
<p>The following draft will show a circular collar which has the virtue of
possessing a stand effect at the centre back with the advantage of laying
perfectly flat on the front shoulder. The usual Prussian collar needs a good
deal of stretching of the stand where it sews to the gorge over the shoulders
to prevent a &quot;kicking off&quot; at the crease edge, but the collar
described requires very little manipulation and is designed to sew straight
to the gorge.</p>

gorge, to enable the collar to lie flat to the centre fastening. This collar
requires well manipulating to produce a good result. The crease line must be
shrunk in, and the seam of the stand requires well stretching at the point
where it sews to the gorge in proximity to the shoulder seams of the coat.</p>

<h3><a name="fur" id="fur"></a>Fur Collar Shapes</h3>
<p>Town coats are usually distinguished by fur collars, and it is not always
possible for the tailor to copy the shape of the made-up outer fur collar
exactly without a lot of trouble and uncertainty. Therefore, it is advisable
to work on standard block patterns of collar shapes and make the necessary
adjustments of size and shape. On the other hand, the continued popularity of
imitation fur fabrics means that both the outer and under-collars can be cut
and made to a definite shape instead of being left to the fur-collar maker's
idea of style. Imitation Persian lamb and astrachan are two favourite
imitation fur fabrics always in vogue, and some are nearly indistinguishable
from the real article.</p>
<p> With regard to the actual cutting of fur collar shapes, generally
speaking, these cannot be systematized to order, but, instead, an outline is
given to a standard size, and adjustments must then be made to agree with the
dimensions of the neck curve and lapel width.</p>

correct locations and angles are indicated in Fig. 173.</p>
<p>When making this collar, use an interlining of collar canvas and also pad
the fall with double-ply wadding.</p>

<p>Fig. 177 illustrates the drafting of a large boat collar. A separate stand
of cloth is utilized to fill in the stand of the collar below the fur edge at
the back of the neck, a method of making that simplifies the operation and
also requires less fur in the collar. This collar shape may be adapted to the
majority of lapel shapes.</p>
<p>To draft&#8212;</p>
<p>Square from X.</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>1 from X = 4 inches.</li>
	<li>2 from 1 = &frac34; inch.</li>
	<li>3 from X = 7&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>4 from 3 = 1&frac14; inches.</li>
	<li>5 from X = 12&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>6 from 5 = 6&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>7 squared from 4 = 1&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>8 from 3 = 1 inch.</li>
	<li>Shape from 6 through 7 to 8 and 2.</li>
	<li>Shape from 7 and 8 to 9, making the dart 3 inches in length.</li>
	<li>Shape from 1 and 2 to 10, making the dart 3 inches in length.</li>
	<li>11 from X = 10 inches. Shape from 6 to 11, adding 1&frac12; inches of
round.</li>
	</ul>
<p>This completes the shape of the actual collar. The separate stand lining
must now be drafted.</p>
<p>The stand takes the shape of the under-collar stand section after the
darts have been seamed out.</p>
<p>To draft&#8212;</p>
<p>Square from X.</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>1 from X = 4&frac34; inches.</li>
	<li>2 from X = 10 inches.</li>
	<li>3 from 2 = 5 inches.</li>
	<li>Shape 3 to 1 as shown.</li>
	<li>4 from X = 5&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>Join 4 to 3 to complete the draft of the stand section.</li>
	</ul>
<h3 class="clear"><a name="standfur" id="standfur"></a><em><a href="illust/178.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,667);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/178-t.jpg" alt="Figure 178" width="216" height="196" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig178" id="fig178"></a>Stand Fur Collar (Fig. 178)</h3>
<p>The accompanying draft illustrates the cutting of a stand fur collar
designed to stand up in the neck to form a deep double fold.</p>
<p>When the darts round the outer edge of the collar shape are sewn out, the
fold and shape of the collar are formed, and a separate piece of material is
then sewn in to make up the stand deficiency.</p>
<p>To draft&#8212;</p>
<p>Square from X.</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>1 from X = 12 inches.</li>
	<li>2 from X = the length round the gorge and lapel of the coat to where the
collar is intended to finish on the lapel.</li>
	<li>3 from 2 = 2 inches.</li>
	<li>Square up from 3 to 4 equal to the length from X to 1.</li>
	<li>5 from 3 = 5 inches.</li>
	<li>Join 5 to 2.</li>
	<li>6 from 1 = 6 inches.</li>
	<li>Join 6 to 5.</li>
	<li>7 from 5 = 4&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>8 from 7 = 4&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>9 is midway of 7 to 8.</li>
	<li>Square from 9 to 10 3&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>Join 7 to 10 and 8 to 10.</li>
	<li>Shape from 8 to 1 as indicated.</li>
	<li>11 from 8 = 2 inches.</li>
	<li>12 from 11 = 2 inches.</li>
	<li>13 is midway of 11 to 12.</li>
	<li>Square from 13 to 14.</li>
	<li>Join 11 to 14 and 12 to 14, making the dart 3&frac34; inches in length.</li>
	<li>When the darts are seamed out, the collar will appear as points 15 to 16
and 17.</li>
	<li>The piece from X to 15, 16 and 17 forms the filled-in stand at the back
of the neck, and, when this section is being cut, two seams should be allowed
round each sewing edge.</li>
	</ul>
<p>The darts are all sewn out in the indicated marks.</p>
<p>Line the collar with canvas and wadding to obtain a stiff foundation for
the stand.</p>

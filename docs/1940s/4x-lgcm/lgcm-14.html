<h3>BLOUSES</h3>
<p>IN recent seasons the blouse has had a renewed popularity owing to the
advent of the very popular sportswear suits combining three-quarter or jacket
length coat and skirt with a blouse or jumper to give colour contrast. Modern
blouses are far removed from the &quot;shirt blouse&quot; style; instead of
that shapeless creation they are feminine in design with draped collars and
&quot;puff&quot; sleeves, trimmed with edgings of pleating and generally much
more fitting to the figure.</p>
<p>Very often blouses can be cut from the dress basis system to satisfy all
the requirements of ease, and the fitting waistcoat styles, worn outside the
skirt at the waist and fastening down the fronts with buttons, are definitely
cut as close in fit as a dress.</p>
<p>The basic drafts for blouses will indicate the cutting of both close- and
loose-fitting designs to cover the subject completely. The basis for
loose-fitting blouses will be given first.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a name="loose" id="loose"></a><em><a href="illust/179.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,570);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/179-t.jpg" alt="Figure 179" width="183" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig179" id="fig179"></a>Basic Draft for Loose-fitting Blouses
(Fig. 179)</h3>
<p>Constructed to the measurements as follows, the system does not allow for
seams; all parts are cut net.</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>Chest = 34 inches.</li>
	<li>Bust =36 inches.</li>
	<li>Waist = 27 inches.</li>
	<li>Natural waist length = 15 inches.</li>
	<li>Half-back width = 6&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>Working scale = one-third of the bust girth plus 6 inches = 18
inches.</li>
	</ul>
<p>To draft&#8212;</p>
<p>Square from X.</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>1 from X = the back depth = one-third of the scale plus 1&frac12;
inches.</li>
	<li>2 from X = the natural waist length = 15 inches.</li>
	<li>3 from 2 = 5 inches allowance for ease and tucking under the skirt
waistband.</li>
	<li>Square out from the above points.</li>
	<li>4 from X = the back neck width = one-sixth of the scale less &frac14;
inch.</li>
	<li>Square up from 4 to 5 the height of the back neck point, i.e. &frac34;
inch.</li>
	<li>Shape the back neck curve from 5 to X.</li>
	<li>6 from 1 = the half-back width plus &frac12; inch for ease.</li>

	<li>Square back from 12 to 13 one-sixth of the scale.</li>
	<li>The across-chest width from 8 to 14 = half the scale less &frac12; inch.
	  <ul>
	    <li> The addition of &frac12; inch to the across-chest width in variation with
          the dress basis draft is made for a draped effect at the front of the
	      armhole and to give extra width across the chest for ease of movement
	      of the
          arms.</li>
      </ul>
	</li>
	<li>15 from 14 = one-sixth of the scale plus &frac14; inch.
	  <ul>
	    <li>The addition of &frac14; inch to this quantity is explained by the
    increase of the across-chest width subsequently affecting this
    point.</li>
      </ul>
	</li>
	<li>16 from 15 = the distance from 8 to 12 less &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>17 is located on the line squared from 6 to 7.</li>

shoulder seam ease.</li>
	<li>Square down from 19 to 20 1 inch.</li>
	<li>Shape the front shoulder seam from 20 to 16.</li>
	<li>The sideseam is located at midway of the armhole between 6 and 14 at
21.</li>
	<li>Shape the front scye as shown, hollowing &frac14; inch in advance of the line
from 14 when shaping from 20 to 21.</li>
	<li>Shape from 21, to 18 as shown.</li>
	<li>Square down from 21 to 22 and 23 on the lines from 2 and 3.</li>
	<li>24 from 23 = 1 inch.</li>
	<li>25 from 23 = 1 inch.</li>
	<li>Shape the sideseams from 21 to 24 and 25, overlapping as indicated.</li>
	<li>26 from 21 = the position of the underarm sideseam dart = one-sixth of
the scale from 21.</li>
	<li>27 is midway of 14 to 8.</li>
	<li>28 from 27 = 2 inches.</li>
	<li>29 from 16 = the distance from 16 to 13.</li>
	<li>Mark the bust dart line from 26 to 28 and shape out the shoulder dart
from 28 to 16 and 29.</li>
	<li>For a round neck line, 30 from 12 = one-sixth of the scale for the size
of the neck opening.</li>
	<li>Shape from 30 to 13.</li>
	<li>For a V-neck opening make the distance from the back neck X to the front
opening at 31 equal to half the total neck opening of 22 inches.</li>
	</ul>
<p>This completes the basic draft for loose-fitting blouses, and the draft
for close-fitting blouses and fancy waistcoats will be given next.</p>

<p>For the purpose of familiarizing the reader with the working-out of the
system as applied to style-reading, the following drafts will illustrate
typical blouse designs as now worn which may be taken as perennial styles.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a name="yoke" id="yoke"></a><em><a href="illust/181.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,602);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/181-t.jpg" alt="Figure 181" width="194" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig181" id="fig181"></a>Blouse with a Yoke Front and Back (Fig.
181)</h3>
<p>The blouse depicted by Fig. 181 has an inset yoke at the front and a
straight yoke across the back shoulders. The blouse fastens down the fronts
with holes and buttons, and the draft illustrates the correct allowances to
be made for the opening to permit the buttons to run centrally down the
front.</p>
<p>The basic system of this draft is the loose-fitting method illustrated by
Fig. 179.</p>
<p>Measurements for the draft are as follows&#8212;</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>Chest = 34 inches.</li>
	<li>Bust = 36 inches.</li>
	<li>Natural waist length = 15 inches.</li>

	<li>31 from the breast line = 3&frac12; inches and 3 inches back from the centre
line from 8 to 29.</li>
	<li>32 from 14 = 4 inches.</li>
	<li>Shape the yoke shoulder seam from 31 to 30 and from 31 to 32, breaking
at the shoulder dart lines as indicated at 33 and 34.</li>
	<li>33 from 16 = 34 from 28, and when the shoulder dart is closed out the
seam run from 31 to 33, 34 and 32 will be continuous.</li>
	<li>For the front opening, allow &frac34; inch from 29 to 35 and 30 to 36.</li>
	<li>Mark the edge from 35 to 36 and then allow an extra 1&frac14; inches from
	  35
to 37 and 36 to 38 for the facing-back of the button-stand.</li>
	<li>39 from 6 = half the back depth from X to 1 for the shape of the back
shoulder yoke.</li>
	<li>Square across from 39 to 40 at the centre back.
	  <ul>
	    <li>After the shoulder dart from 33 and 16 has been closed to 34 and 28
    there will be a surplus quantity in the bodice seam from 31 to 32 indicated
    at 33 to 34. This quantity may be either gathered or tucked out to agree
	      with the length of the shoulder yoke from 31 to 32 or else reduced as
	      indicated
    by the dash lines from 41 to the front yoke seam running round to
    30.</li>
      </ul>
	</li>
	</ul>
<p>This completes the draft of a blouse with front and back shoulder yokes. A
circular collar of the &quot; Peter Pan&quot; type is usually sewn to the
neck.</p>

(Fig. 182)</h3>
<p>As an example of diverting the position of the shoulder seam to allow the
front shoulder of the bodice to be gathered into the seam, Fig. 182 shows a
blouse design that will always be fashionable. Cut on severe lines, the front
neck opening is formed by an inset button-stand and catch similar to those of
a sports shirt. The blouse is fairly close-fitting at the waist, and this
effect is achieved by means of front and back waist darts and is drafted by
the system illustrated by Fig. 180.</p>
<p>Measures for the draft are as follows&#8212;</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>Chest = 32 inches.</li>
	<li>Bust = 34 inches.</li>
	<li>Waist = 26 inches, increased to 29 inches for the degree of looseness
over the tight waist measure.</li>
	<li>Natural waist length = 14&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>Half-back width = 6&frac14; inches.</li>
	<li>Working scale = half the bust girth = 17 inches.</li>
	</ul>

<p>The following draft illustrates a bolero coatee cut very much on the lines
of a uniform mess jacket with roll lapels and a link-button fastening. Though
not a blouse, it is worn under a costume jacket and may be classed as a
waistcoat. At the back, a side-body seam curves from the shoulder to
terminate in a point below the waist in the style of a page-boy's jacket, and
this garment may be made without sleeves for wearing over a blouse.</p>
<p>Measures for the draft are as follows&#8212;</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>Chest = 36 inches.</li>
	<li>Bust = 40 inches.</li>
	<li>Waist = 32 inches, increased to 34 inches for ease.</li>
	<li>Natural waist length = 15&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>Back length = 19 inches.</li>
	<li>Half-back width = 6&frac34; inches.</li>
	</ul>
<p>The figure chosen for this draft shows an increased prominence of the bust
over the normal 2 inches increase, so that two scales are necessary for
drafting the pattern.</p>
<p>Firstly, ascertain the normal bust girth in proportion to the chest size
and calculate the scale of the back shoulder section as usual. In this
instance, the normal proportion will be based on a 38-inch bust, and the
scale one-third of 38 inches plus 6 inches, i.e. 18&frac34; inches.</p>
<p>The scale for the front shoulder section to provide for the increased bust
prominence is based on the actual bust girth of 40 inches; therefore,
one-third of the bust (40 inches) plus 6 inches finds the front shoulder
scale as 19&frac12; inches.</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>Working scale (back) = 18&frac34; inches.</li>
	<li>Working scale (front) = 19&frac12; inches.</li>
	</ul>
<p>To draft&#8212;</p>
<p>Square lines from X.</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>1 from X = the back depth = one-third of the scale (18&frac34; inches) plus
1&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>2 from X = the natural waist length = 15&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>3 from X = the full coatee length =19 inches.</li>
	<li>4 from X = the back neck width = one-sixth of the scale (18&frac12; inches)
less &frac14; inch.</li>
	<li>5 from 4 = the height of the back neck curve = &frac34; inch.</li>
	<li>Shape the back neck curve from 5 to X.</li>
	<li>6 from 1 = the half-back width of 6&frac34; inches net.</li>
	<li>Square up from 6 to 7 on the line squared out from X.</li>
	<li>8 from 1 = the half-bust measure plus 1 inch.</li>
	<li>Square down from 8 to 9 on the waist line.</li>
	<li>Square up from 8 to 10 one-third of the scale (19&frac12; inches) plus 1&frac12;
inches.</li>
	<li>This shows an increase of length to provide for the increased contour
capacity of the bust prominence.</li>
	<li>11 from 10 = one-twelfth of the scale (19&frac12; inches).</li>
	<li>12 from 11 = one-sixth of the scale (19&frac12; inches).</li>
	</ul>
<p>The next consideration is that of the across-chest width.</p>
<p>The across-chest width for a normal 38-inch bust girth is one-fourth of
the bust measure less 1 inch, i.e. 8&frac12; inches.</p>
<p>The across-chest width for a normal 40-inch bust girth is one-fourth of
the bust measure less 1 inch, i.e. 9 inches.</p>
<p>The across-chest width of a figure showing a 4-inch increase of bust girth
over the actual chest girth is greater than the width for a normal 40-inch
bust girth as the increase to 40 inches does not take place proportionately
throughout the circumference of the figure; instead, it is greater at the
front, as delineated by the half-back width remaining the same as for a
38-inch bust.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the across-chest width does not increase the total
increase of the half-bust circumference, namely, 1 inch; otherwise, the scye
width would remain the same as for a normal 38-inch bust girth. The author
calculates the increase over the normal across-chest width for a 40-inch bust
girth to be two-thirds of the difference between the normal width for a

<h3>MAGYARS</h3>
<h3><a name="magyar" id="magyar"></a>The Magyar Problem and Its Relation to
Blouse Design</h3>
<p>The magyar design is an exceedingly popular vogue at all seasons, and in
recent months this feature has been very much to the fore of fashion owing to
the square-shouldered styles necessitating width about the shoulders.</p>
<p>For dresses and blouses, the magyar cut is intensely feminine and
productive of a very chic effect by accentuating with width and drapery about
the shoulders the comparative slenderness of a closely-moulded hip line. The
author has designed many dresses with the magyar bodice and sleeve and with a
perfectly plain skirt, giving an extremely slender effect to the figure. He
does not wish to quote film fashions as an example of style, but we know that
the finest designers in the dress world are designing for the screen, and he
has noticed that the magyar style is featured to a great extent. No doubt it
is like many other style features of the old days, and is taking on a new and
more fashionable lease of life under modern treatment and cut.</p>
<p>With the improvement in cutting knowledge, many of the styles of our
mothers and grandmothers would present an unrecognizable chic effect cut and
made by modern methods and also, more important, worn by the typically smart
modern woman.</p>
<p>The folds at the front and back of the armhole inseparable from magyar
design are welcomed by the wearer these days as part of the attractiveness of
the dress, and she would not have them removed to obtain more of a
closer-fitting sleeve. A fitting magyar is an impossibility, and rightly so,
for the charm of a magyar lies in the draped effect presented by the sleeves
when the arms are at the side.</p>
<p>The problem in magyar design is to provide for movement of the arms above
the horizontal position when the arms are outstretched from the shoulders.
With some magyar designs provision for movement can be allowed by the
insertion of what amounts to a &quot;wedge&quot; or &quot;gusset&quot; at the
sideseams under the arms, but if a true magyar sleeve and shoulder are
required this cannot be achieved.</p>
<p>When designing dresses of this character, the author always endeavours to
have a seam running from the shoulders to under the arm at the sideseam where
the sleeve terminates, so as to allow extra length in the under-part of the
sleeve for movement of the arms. Maybe the result cannot be called a true
magyar as defined by the rule that a magyar consists of the bodice and sleeve
in one whole piece, but in his opinion the design of the garment is more
important than adherence to a standardized idea of what constitutes a magyar.
The magyars of the old days were shapeless monstrosities with no redeeming
features of design, and the modern idea of adding seams purely for their
effect is a feature whereby the ability of the cutter is taxed to the utmost
in the interpretation of intricate designing.</p>
<p>In considering the drafting of a magyar base pattern, the first essential
is to find the centre of the shoulder to ensure that the shoulder seam of the
bodice is in this position; for the centre of the shoulder is exactly the
centre shoulder seam of the sleeve, and to balance the sleeve perfectly the
sleeve should be divided equally each side of the shoulder seam.</p>
<p>The location of the shoulder seam exactly in the centre of the shoulder
applies equally to coats, dresses and blouses and forms the standard
variation.</p>

and Other Garments (Fig. 186)</h3>
<p>To illustrate the magyar basis draft, a blouse bodice is used and the
reconstruction of the shoulder section superimposed thereon. Drafted to a
36-inch bust girth, the subsidiary measures are as follows&#8212;</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>Chest = 34 inches.</li>
	<li>Bust = 36 inches.</li>
	<li>Natural waist length = 15 inches.</li>
	<li>Half-back width = 6&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>Working scale = half the bust girth = 18 inches.</li>
	</ul>
<p>To draft&#8212;</p>
<p>Square from X.</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>1 from X = the back depth = one-third of the scale plus 1&frac12;
inches.</li>
	<li>2 from X = the natural waist length = 15 inches.</li>
	<li>3 from 2 = 5 inches for the full length from X.</li>
	</ul>
<p>In the drafting of magyars, the half-back width is of little importance,
but, to prevent any misunderstanding, the construction line is indicated.</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>4 from 1 = the half-back width plus &frac12; inch as for blouses.</li>
	<li>Square up from 4 to 5 on the construction line from X.</li>
	<li>Square out from 1 to 6 half the bust measure plus 2 inches.</li>
	<li>This allowance of 2 inches over the half-bust measure is the standard
addition for loose-fitting blouses.</li>
	<li>Square down from 6 to 8 and 9 and up from 6 to 7 on the line squared out
from X.</li>
	</ul>
<p>To locate the centre of the shoulder to make the sleeve exactly balanced,
the position of the back neck curve must be considered with the location of
the front neck point and the height of the front shoulder neck point from the
breast line. The addition of 3/8 inch to the height of the back shoulder and
a reduction of 3/8 inch from the front shoulder neck-point height locate the
centre of the shoulder in the draft for a 36-inch bust girth. Practically
speaking, the centre of the shoulder is located by the difference between the
height of the back neck point and the height of the front neck point from the
breast line when the back and forepart are laid together. The height of the
back neck point from the neck balance line is always &frac34; inch for dresses and
blouse drafts and 1 inch for coats, while the front neck point is always
one-twelfth of the scale above the same neck balance line. Therefore, the
centre of the shoulder must be half the difference between &frac34; inch and
one-twelfth of the scale above the neck construction line. The raising of the
back neck point necessitates an increase in the width of the back neck curve
and a reduction in the width of the front neck curve. An addition of 1/8 inch
to the back neck curve width and 1/8 inch reduction of the front neck curve
width are made.</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>Therefore, 10 from X = one-sixth of the scale less 1/8 inch.</li>
	<li>11 from 10 = the usual back neck height of &frac34; inch.</li>
	<li>12 from 10 = the usual addition of one-twelfth of the scale made to the
length of front shoulder.</li>
	<li>13 from 12 is half 11 to 12 for the position of the centre of the
shoulder.</li>
	<li>Shape the back neck curve from 13 to X.</li>
	<li>14 from 7 = the distance from 10 to 13.</li>
	<li>15 squared back from 14 is equal to the distance from X to 10.</li>
	<li>16 from 14 = one-sixth of the scale less 1/8 inch for the front neck
curve.</li>
	<li>Shape the front neck curve from 16 to 15.</li>
	<li>The across-chest width does not count for much value as the sleeve and
bodice are cut in one piece.</li>
	<li>Square up from 17 to 18.</li>
	</ul>
<p>It is necessary to have the sideseam exactly in the centre of the draft so
that the sleeve is balanced, i.e. equal in width from the centre of the
shoulder to the centre of the underarm.</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>Square up from 19 to 20 and down from 19 to 21 and 22.</li>
	<li>The shoulder slope is located at 23, one-third of the scale plus &frac14; inch
	  from 19.
	  <ul>
	    <li>The shoulder seam from 15 to 23 will lie exactly over the shoulder seam
    from 13 to 23 when the pattern is cut through from the sideseam and
    overlapped.</li>
      </ul>
	</li>
	<li>Point 24 indicates the danger-point above which the under-part of the
sleeve should not be raised.</li>
	</ul>
<p>This completes the basic outline of the magyar draft.</p>

Seam from Shoulder to Sideseam (Fig. 189)</h3>
<p>Modern magyar design usually incorporates a seam from the shoulder to the
sideseam to enable an extra amount of &quot;lift&quot; to be infused in the
sleeve. This seam takes the form of design rather than any specified position
and may be diverted at will, though always terminating at the  sideseam to
define the actual scye level.</p>
<p>Fig. 189 illustrates the draft of a magyar blouse showing the addition of
more &quot;lift&quot; in the sleeve. The design is very plain, yet smart, and
the author has seen numbers of blouses made up in this manner. The scye is
lowered half-way towards the waist line for a deep-scye effect, and the
fronts fasten all the way down to the bottom edge with holes and buttons.</p>
<p>Measures for the draft are as follows&#8212;</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>Chest = 34 inches.</li>
	<li>Bust = 36 inches.</li>
	<li>Natural waist length =15 inches.</li>

	<li>11 squared up from 8 = one-third of the scale plus &frac14; inch.</li>
	<li>Line through the sleeve angle from 7 to 11 and 12, making 12 from 7 equal
	  to the sleeve length of 27 inches.</li>

	<li>16 from 10 = 1 inch. Shape the sideseam from 15 to 16.</li>
	<li>The position of the shoulder seam running down over the bust into the
sideseam is located at 3&frac12; inches from 7.</li>
	<li>18 from 8 = 4 inches.</li>
	<li>Shape the seam run from 17 to 18 and 15.
	  <ul>
	    <li>To give an extra quantity of length in the under-part of the sleeve
    which facilitates the movement of the arms, by pivoting from 18, sweep from
    15 to 19 equal to half the distance the scye is lowered from 8 to 15. Shape
    the seam run from 18 to 19, hollowing slightly to agree with the seam run
    from 18 to 15.</li>
      </ul>
	</li>
	<li>Shape the under-sleeve from 18 through 15 to 13 as shown, hollowing
inside the construction line from 14 to 13 from the elbow to the wrist.</li>
	<li>20 from 5 = one-sixth of the scale less &frac14; inch for the neck
opening.</li>
	<li>Shape the neck opening from 20 to 7.</li>
	<li>Add &frac34; inch on the fronts from 20 to 21 for the button stand and an
extra &frac34; inch from 21 to 22 for facing back the front edge.</li>
	<li>Square down from 21 to 23 and 22 to 24 to complete the draft.</li>
	</ul>
<p>The back is cut on the fold and straight of the material, and the sleeve
is cut without a seam over the arm in one piece. It is quite a good plan to
cut the sleeve on the bias of the material as it will fall much more softly
and provide more freedom of movement than if it is cut on the straight.</p>

Bodice Cut Whole (Fig. 192)</h3>
<p>Another example of magyar design is illustrated by Fig. 192. This dress
has elbow-length plain sleeves cut whole with the bodice at the back part and
inset to the centre of the shoulder at the front. The fronts fasten with
buttons from a high, round neck line, and a new feature is the run of the
waist suppression dart diagonally from the waist at the side to under the
bust. An inset panel following the run of the sleeve seams relieves the plain
back skirt and is linked up with the front skirt panel seam to the hem line.
The skirt is very close-fitting, and a slight flare is added to the front
panel seams for freedom of movement. This draft also gives a good example of
waist suppression without panel seams or darts at the back waist.</p>

cut in one. A shaped panel is inset at the front, and the collarless neck
line finishes by the fronts being wrapped over to the sideseam and fastened
with three buttons. The sleeves are perfectly plain, giving scope for many
variations of design at will.</p>

	  <ul>
	    <li>To reduce the waist suppression from the bodice, mark down 3 inches
	      from 21 to 60 and mark out 4 inches to 61; then close out the waist suppression
    quantity at the waist line by pivoting from 61 to open a sideseam dart at
    60.</li>
      </ul>
	</li>
	</ul>
<p>Alternatively, a small dart can be inserted from the waist line up under
the bust prominence.</p>
<p>This magyar shoulder can be cut with or without an over-shoulder seam as
neither the back nor the front need be cut on the fold edge of the
material.</p>
<h3><a name="cape" id="cape"></a>CAPE CUTTING BY BLOCK PATTERNS</h3>
<p>The quickest and easiest method of cutting any shoulder capes is by the
use of a block pattern. The shoulder seam of the block should be on the top
of the shoulder before the cape is drafted, and, to produce a half-circular
hip-length cape, proceed as in Fig. 196.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><a href="illust/196.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,566);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/196-t.jpg" alt="Figure 196" width="182" height="196" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig196" id="fig196"></a>The Half-circular Cape (Fig. 196)</h3>
<p>Take the back part of the block pattern and mark round the edges on a
sheet of pattern paper or the material, and then place the front shoulder
seam against the shoulder end of the back with the dart allowance discounted
so that the back and front neck points will meet when the shoulder dart is
sewn out. Lay the forepart block at right-angles with the back and complete
the cape outline by marking round the edges and across the hip line for
length. This gives the preliminary outline of a half-circular cape with a
shoulder dart only.</p>
<p>In the event of patterned material necessitating the back and front of the
cape being cut on the straight of the material, a seam must be run over the
shoulder of the cape to the bottom edge as illustrated by the dash line.
Divide the distance between the back and front neck points and mark half-way.
Then run a line from this point through the shoulder ends, continuing down to
the edge. For additional or less width in the bottom edge of the cape, the
back and front neck points should be closed together or opened out
respectively.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a name="panel" id="panel"></a><em><a href="illust/197.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',562,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/197-t.jpg" alt="Figure 197" width="199" height="125" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig197" id="fig197"></a>Cape Set in Panel Seams (Fig. 197)</h3>
<p>To cut a short cape to sew in with the panel seams at the back and front,
lay the shoulder ends together and then make a right-angle with the centre
back and front of the block pattern as in Fig. 197 (a). Mark the cape to
waist length at the back and front and then shape the bottom edge from
sideseam to sideseam by pivoting from the shoulder end. For an increase of
width in the flare of the cape close out the shoulder dart and cut whole.</p>
<p>Fig. 197 (b) illustrates how to draft a cape by system.</p>
<p>Square from X.</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>1 from X = one-twelfth of the scale.</li>
	<li>2 from X = &frac34; inch.</li>
	<li>3 is midway of 2 to 1.</li>
	<li>5 from X = &frac34; inch always.</li>
	<li>Square out from 3 and 5.</li>
	<li>4 from 3 = one-sixth of the scale less 1/8 inch.</li>
	<li>6 from X = the depth of the scye = one-third of the scale plus 1&frac12;
inches.</li>
	<li>7 from X = the waist length.</li>
	<li>8 from X = the full cape length.</li>
	<li>Square out from 6, 7 and 8.</li>
	<li>9 from 5 = the normal half-back width plus &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>10 from 6 = one-fourth of the breast measure plus 4 inches.</li>
	<li>Line through from 9 to 10 and 11.</li>
	<li>11 from 9 = the cape length pivoted from the bottom edge.</li>
	<li>Continue the line from 11 and 10 through 9 to 12, making 12 from 9 equal
to 9 to 4.</li>
	<li>When points 12 and 4 are adjacent, the full extent of width in the
bottom edge of the cape is obtained, and any increase of width over this
quantity must be accompanied by a seam over the shoulder.</li>
	<li>For a linked cape, add about &frac34; inch down the front edge from 13 to 14,
and, for a buttoned front, add 1&frac12; inches.</li></ul>

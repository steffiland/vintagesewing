<h3><a name="basic" id="basic"></a>Basic System for Sleeves</h3>
  <p> THE basis for drafting sleeve styles is divided into two sections, firstly
  the two-piece type with seams at the fore and hindarm, and secondly the one-piece
  variety having a seam underneath the sleeve to run with the sideseam of the
  coat or alternatively a seam at the forearm; in either instance there is no
  hind-arm seam.</p><p>
  For strictly tailored styles of costume jackets or long coats, the usual rule
  is to utilize the two-piece basis for the shapely run of seams, and slim line
  is more in keeping with the general restrained and neat effect of the ensemble.
  The one-piece basis will be found advantageous for adaptation to present-day
  sportswear and dressy styles, with their unorthodox pleated or darted sleeve
  effects. In a hindarm in one piece without a seam the plain character of the
  sleeve permits of easier manipulation and variation of shape than the more
  definite lines of the two-piece basis.</p><p>
  No decided seam runs are definite for either sleeve, while manipulation of
  the pattern by cutting open or transposing seams to meet the needs of the sleeve
  design is necessary to gain the requisite effect. For example, a &quot;cartridge-pleated&quot; sleeve
  has no definite fixed size or shape, but depends upon the number of pleats
  or amount of material taken up in the pleating for the alteration in shape
  from the original one-piece draft; a sleeve with fullness above the elbow may
  be based upon a two-piece draft with the seam at the hindarm above the elbow
  eliminated, and the whole upper-arm section cut in one piece, whilst the forearm
  is in two pieces for the attainment of a shaped cuff.</p><p>
  Manipulation of the basis pattern by splitting open and opening out for darted
  and pleated effects is essential in the cutting of modern sleeves; we cannot
  expect a system to adapt itself to all the varied and intricate designs that
  are in vogue without departing from the orthodox principles governing the original
  draft. Modern sleeves cannot be cut by a systematic draft basis; the effect
  is more of drapery than cutting, so knowledge of where to manipulate a pattern
  to obtain a pouched or pleated effect is of more importance than attempting
  to achieve the same result by a straightforward draft system.</p><p>
  The ability to visualize a design in its component parts before being sewn
  together, where length or width has been added to arrive at the finished effect,
  can be attained by experimenting with muslin, for there are set principles
  governing this manipulation which become familiar with a little experience.
  Elsewhere in the book an endeavour will be made to indicate the general methods
  adopted by the author for the production of pouched and draped sleeve effects.</p>
  <p>
  In deciding the dimensions and constructional points necessary for the basis
  sleeve draft, there are two factors to consider&#8212;</p>
  <p>
  (1) The height, width and total circumference of the scye or armhole into which
  the sleeve must sew.</p><p>
  (2) The balance or &quot;hang&quot; of the sleeve in the scye, in accordance
  with the figure attitude, to give a maximum of freedom of movement in wear.</p><p>
  The balance or &quot;hang&quot; of the sleeve varies with different figure
  attitudes inasmuch as a stooping figure requires adjustment of the sleeve to
  a more forward &quot;hang,&quot; while for erect figures, a rebalancing of
  the sleeve backwards will be needed.</p><p>
  Sleeves for special purposes also need adjustment of constructional points,
  for a garment used for golfing, motoring or riding exclusively to any other
  consideration will require a sleeve in accordance with the position of the
  arms for the majority of the time.</p><p>
  The sleeve in the scye must be so balanced that a good &quot;hang&quot; is
  obtained when the arm is in the natural position at the side and also to give
  essential freedom in movement to the greatest extent and radius. Therefore,
  a point on the back scye and a point at the front scye, called the back and
  front pitches, decide the balance of the sleeve in the scye. With a normal
  sleeve raising or lowering of each of these pitches will result in a forward
  or backward hanging sleeve. The back pitch is decided by the position of the
  hindarm seam in two-piece sleeves, for a wider top-sleeve would need a lower
  pitch and <em>vice versa</em>. The front pitch decides the &quot;hang&quot; of the sleeve
  in the scye, for the sleeve hinges at this point, and sewing round to the back
  pitch locates this point on the basis of width across the sleeve head.</p>
  <p>
  After the location of the pitches the next factor to consider is the height
    of the sleeve in the scye above the back pitch, to cover the shoulder cap
    and meet the shoulder seam. This height is decided by the
  position of the shoulder end (from the back pitch and the breast line level)
  when the shoulder seams are sewn together.</p>
  <p>
  The width of the sleeve from the front seam to the back one is decided by the
  actual measure between the front and back pitches round the circumference of
  the scye. This measure is applied diagonally on the sleeve draft from the front
  pitch to the back one, thereby giving a workable allowance for the easing-in
  of the sleeve over the shoulder cap.</p><p>
  Measurement of the actual scye circumference is the only practical method of
  assessing sleeve width in direct relationship with the needs of the scye. A
  sleeve system based upon the working scale does not provide automatic adjustment
  for variation in size or shape of the scye. Often we find the needs of a figure
  in armhole size are in direct contrast to the build; the big woman often does
  not require a scye much in excess of that applicable to a woman 4 inches or
  so smaller in the bust girth. By basing the sleeve system on actual scye measurements,
  we are sure of a sleeve that is equal to all the demands of the particular
  armhole irrespective of bust size.</p>

  <h5>Figure 26&#8212;Basic System for Two-piece Sleeve Cutting</h5>
  <p>
    Fig. 26 shows the main constructional points superimposed upon the 34-inch
  bust basis draft.</p>
  <p>
  The front pitch A is located at &frac34; inch up from the breast line. This is
    the fixed position for determining the forward &quot;hang&quot; of the sleeve
    in the scye.</p>
  <p>
  The back pitch B is found at half the depth of scye quantity X to 1, up from
  the breast line.</p>
  <p>
  As the sleeve hinges from these two pitches, the height of the sleeve in the
  scye is determined by the sewn-together position of the shoulder seams. This
  quantity is called the &quot;crown height,&quot; and is found as follows. Make
  a sweep from a point C<span class="small">1</span>, a seam below the front shoulder end, pivoting from
  the front pitch A. A similar sweep made from C<span class="small">2</span>, a seam below the back shoulder
  end, is pivoted from the back pitch B, intersecting the front sweep at D.</p><p>
  The height of the point where the two sweeps intersect at D from the line squared
  across from B to X equals the crown height in accordance with the requirements
  of the scye when the shoulders are in position on the figure.</p><p>
  The back is laid in position for showing how the measurement between the back
  and front pitches is applied to determine the width of the sleeve diagonally
  from A to B.</p><p>
  The sleeve is shown drafted in to the scye direct as an indication of how the
  measures derived from the scye are applied.</p><p>
  To draft&#8212;</p>
  <ul class="small">
    <li> 1 from A = &frac12; inch, or two seams.</li>
    <li>Square up from 1 to X, and from B
      to X. X from the breast line is therefore the same distance as point B.</li>
    <li>2
        from 1 = the distance round the top-scye from A to
  B, the measure between the back and front pitches = 8 &frac12; inches.</li>
    <li>3 from 2 =
      one-third of the distance 1 to B plus &frac34; inch.</li>
    <li>4 from 3 = the crown height
    as previously found = 1&frac12; inches.
      <ul>
        <li>Point 3 is located at one-third of
            1 to B, plus &frac34; inch, because the highest point of the scye is
          at the junction of the shoulder seams which is approximately
        one-third of the scye circumference between the back and front pitches.          </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>5 is midway X to 3. </li>
    <li>Shape the sleeve crown run from 1 to 5, 4 and
            2.</li>
    <li>6 from 2 = the sleeve length less the half-back width
  applied from 2.</li>
    <li>7 from 6 = 1&frac14; inches square out from this point.</li>
    <li>8 from 7 = &frac34; inch. </li>
    <li>Join
    8 to 1.
      <ul>
        <li>This point controls the forward &quot;hang&quot; of the sleeve
          in conjunction with the front pitch location. It is safer in practice
          to cut the sleeve to
    hang forward than to rely on the tailor to pitch it always correctly.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>9 from 8 for the standard width of the cuffs = one-third of the total
      scye circumference less &frac34; inch.
      <ul>
        <li>By basing the cuff width on the size of
            the armhole, we always have this width in proportion to the sleeve.          </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Join 9 to 6 to find point 10.</li>
    <li>11 is equal to half 1 to 10 for the position
      of the elbow. </li>
    <li>Square out from 11 to 12, 13 and 14.</li>
    <li>12 from 11 = 1&frac14; inches. Join the
      forearm construction
  lines from 1 to 12 and 10.</li>
    <li>13 is found on the line squared out from 11.</li>
    <li>14 from 13 = 1&frac34; inches. Join
      2 to 14 and 9 for the
  hindarm constructional lines.</li>
    <li>15 from 1 squared by line 1 to 8 = one-sixth of
      the scale.</li>
    <li>16 from 1 diagonally = the distance round the under-scye between the
    pitches A to B = 7&frac12; inches.</li>
    <li>Shape the run of the under-sleeve from
        1, 15 to 16.      </li>
    <li>Complete the hindarm seam run from 16 to 14 as shown.</li>
  </ul>

  The basis draft for two-piece sleeves is completed. Variations of seam placements

  <h5>Figure 27&#8212;Two-piece Sleeve Basis Drafted Away from the Scye</h5>
  <p>
    To produce the sleeve draft away from the scye, the following quantities
      derived from the measurement of the scye are necessary&#8212;</p>
  <p>
    (1) The height of the back pitch from the breast line, 3&frac34; inches.</p>
  <p>
    (2) The height of the sleeve crown above the back pitch, 1&frac12; inches.</p>
  <p>
    (3) The width of the top sleeve measured between the two pitches in a straight
  line, 8&frac12; inches.</p>
  <p>
  (4) The width of the under-sleeve measured between the pitches round the under-scye,
  7&frac12; inches.</p>
  <p>
  (5) The total scye circumference, 16 inches.</p><p>
  To draft&#8212;</p>
  <ul class="small">
    <li>Square from X, the starting point.</li>
    <li>1 from X = the height of the back pitch
      from the breast line less &frac12; inch.</li>
    <li>2 from 1 = the top-sleeve width, measured
        between the pitches and applied diagonally from 1 to the line squared
      from X.</li>
    <li>3 from 2 = one-third of the distance from 1 to 2 plus &frac34; inch.</li>
    <li>4 from
      3 = the crown height as found in the basis
  draft = 1&frac12; inches.</li>
    <li>5 is located midway 3 to X.</li>
    <li>6 from 2 = the sleeve length measure applied
      diagonally from 2, less the width of the back.</li>
    <li>7 from 6 = 1&frac14; inches.
      Square up and down from this
  point.</li>
    <li>8 from 7 = &frac34; inch always. Join 8 to 1.</li>
    <li>9 from 8 = one-third of the total
      scye circumference less &frac34; inch. </li>
    <li>Join 9 to 6 to locate 10.</li>
    <li>11 is midway 1 to 10 for the position of the
      elbow. </li>
    <li>By line 1 to 8 square from this point.</li>
    <li>12 from 11 = 1&frac14; inches. Join 2
      to 9 to locate point 13.</li>
    <li>14 from 13 = 1&frac34; inches. Join 12 to 14 and 10.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  This completes the location of the basic constructional points for drafting
  the sleeve away from the scye.</p><h3>  Fig. 27 (b)</h3>
  <p>
  Here the seam runs are shown superimposed upon the constructional lines and
  points.</p>
  <ul class="small">
    <li> Shape the crown of the sleeve from 1 to 5, 4 and 2 as indicated.
      <ul>
        <li>The forearm
            is slightly hollowed as marked from 1, 12 to 10, and a slight amount
          of round is added on the hindarm seam from 2 to 14 and 9.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>

  <p>
  To draft the under-sleeve section, measure up the under-scye between the back

  <ul class="small">
    <li>
    15 squared from 1 by line 1 to 8 = one-sixth of the

    <li>Shape
      from 1, 15 to 16, and from 16 to 14 to complete the under-sleeve draft.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  The above system will provide a good &quot;hanging&quot; sleeve for the majority
  of figures, without an excessive amount of fullness to ease-in over the shoulder
  point, as this section of the sleeve is kept fairly flat from the front of
  the scye up to the crown.</p>

  <p>The standard basic draft for cutting one-piece sleeves is illustrated by
  Fig. 28.</p>
  <p> Identical measures are taken as for the two-piece styles, with two additional
  measures, namely, the distance from the front pitch to the underarm seam and
    the distance from the back sleeve pitch to the same point. The following
  are the scye measures&#8212;</p>
  <p>
  (1) The height of the back sleeve pitch from the breast line, 3&frac34; inches.</p>
  <p>
  (2) The crown height above the back pitch, 1&frac12; inches.</p>
  <p>
  (3) The width of the top-sleeve measured between the pitches in a straight
  line, 8&frac12; inches.</p>
  <p>
  (4) The width of the under-sleeve measured between the pitches round the
  under-scye, 7&frac12; inches.</p>
  <p>
  (5) The total scye circumference, 16 inches.</p>
  <p>
  (6) The distance from the front sleeve pitch to the underarm seam, 2&frac12;
    inches.</p>
  <p>
  (7) The distance from the back sleeve pitch to the underarm seam, 5 inches.</p>

  <p>The one-piece sleeve basis is shown drafted in the scye to illustrate
    clearly the constructional method. A is the front sleeve pitch, &frac34; inch

  <p>Fig. 29 illustrates the outline of the completed one-piece sleeve draft.
    Instead of squaring across from the lines joining 1 and 11 and 2 and 18
    on the basis draft in order to locate the lines joining 14 to
  16 and 22 to 20, another method is to fold over the pattern paper in the former
  lines and then trace through the inside sleeve seams 17 to 15 and 13 to 15.
  The outline will then be the same as though these lines were drafted across.
  This method is perhaps more accurate than by squaring, but it all depends on
  the individual accuracy of each worker; in any case, it is a simple method
  for producing the under-sleeve sections, back and front.</p>

        so that it turns back to lie with the original line of the seam. Therefore,
        square from 12 to 19 by line 3 to 18, making the distance from 18 to

    <li> Square from line 3 to 18 to 15 to locate point 23 and then square back

  <p>
  The constructional variations for all increases of width in the sleeve at the
  elbow and wrist are similar to those in the above description; in all instances,
  it is possible to produce the sleeve outline by tracing through the inside
  seams on to the folded pattern paper and then re-laying out to obtain an identical
  outline as that achieved by drafting direct.</p>
  <p>
  This drafting method is the only practical system which furnishes us with a
  sleeve pattern in which the inside sleeve seams will be in alignment for sewing
  together. Very often, one-piece sleeve systems give a well-balanced sleeve
  without a wrist dart or with moderate elbow width, but are useless for obtaining
    a sleeve with abnormal elbow or wrist width, for the seams may not lie perfectly
    together for sewing
  and may need adjustment in length of either seam.</p>
  <p>
  The one-piece sleeve is very useful for drafting intricate sleeve designs,
  as the retention of only one seam allows for more latitude for designing on
  the base pattern outline.</p>

  <p>Displacement of seam runs is a feature of ladies' sleeves, and Fig. 32 (a)
  shows a useful sleeve draft in which the forearm seam is placed further under
  the arm and the hindarm seam is treated in a like manner.</p>
  <p>
  The back pitch is lowered on the coat 1&frac12; inches or more to taste
  to agree with the lowering of the seam on the sleeve.</p>
  <p>
  This type of sleeve will be found useful for inserting in sidebody coats where
  the sidebody seam finishes in the scye approximately 2 inches or more up from
  the breast line; whereas the basis draft is in harmony with the seam runs of
  a patrol or similar panel-back coat when the back seams finish at the normal
  back pitch location.</p><p>

  this point. </li>
    <li>Join 2 to 10 to locate point 13.</li>
    <li> 14 from 13 = 2 inches; &frac14; inch more than the basis draft
  is added to move the seam at the elbow further back in alignment with the variation
  of the sleeve head by lowering the back pitch.</li>
    <li> 15 from 14 = &frac12; inch, to keep the sleeve width at the
  elbow correct to measure.</li>
    <li> 16 from 2 = the amount the back pitch has been
  lowered from B in Fig. 26.</li>

    <li>Shape the top of the under-sleeve
    and hindarm seam as indicated.
      <ul>
        <li> For the displacement of the forearm seam further under the arm,
          called &quot;three-quarter-sleeve
        finish or false forearm,&quot; reduce the under-sleeve &frac34; inch at 1
        to 19, 21 from 12 and 23 from 9 and re-mark the seam run.</li>
        <li>Add &frac34; inch to
          the top-sleeve from 1 to 20, 12 to 22 and 9 to 24 and then reshape
        the seam run.</li>
        <li>The new forearm seam will require stretching in the hollow
            of the elbow at 22, to enable the seam to lie flat against the underseam
            from 6, 21 to 19,
      and make up the slight difference in length between these two seams.</li>

  Fig. 32 (b) shows a useful one-piece sleeve draft with a variation of
  the underseam to the forearm position. In all respects, this sleeve has the
  shapely run of the two-piece basis with the additional advantage in construction
  of being all in one piece above the elbow without a hindarm seam.</p>

          13 up or down on the line squared from 7.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  Fig. 32 (c) illustrates the sleeve as it appears when laid open. This draft
  is very useful for the cutting of pouched or pleated sleeves, when the design
  necessitates a hindarm without a seam in addition to a close degree of shape
  from the elbow to the wrist.</p>

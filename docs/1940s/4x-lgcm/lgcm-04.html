<h3><a name="correct" id="correct"></a>The Correct Location of Waist Suppression</h3>
  <p> THE governing factor for balance and fit of a garment is the correct allocation
  and distribution of waist suppression. This factor is of major importance in
  the cutting of coats, as the influence for good or bad is felt throughout.</p>
  <p>
  The extreme variations of comparative size between bust, waist, and hips, and
  diversity in shape in each of these sections, call for a specialized cutting
  and modelling knowledge before the natural shape and contour of the human frame
  can be satisfactorily fitted.</p>
  <p>
  Scientific allowances for waist suppression are of no value unless the fundamental
  truth is realized that suppression in one location must always have the object
  of creating a closer fit elsewhere in conjunction, other than to influence
  the garment only in the location operated upon.</p><p>
  To be skilful cutters, we cannot go on mistakenly doing things without endeavouring
  to reason why defects occur, when according to system they should not do so.
  On the vital question of correct waist suppression, we must get down to essentials.</p><p>
  The principle involved is that a curve is longer than a straight line between
  two given points; this being so, length must be allowed and provided to enable
  the garment to follow the natural curves of the figure.</p><p>
  Once this fundamental truth is realized, we are progressing in the right direction.
  From his experience of modelling on a stand, and on a figure direct, the author
  has found that for the purpose of suppression, the human figure from the bust
  to the hip level may be divided into four distinct sections; which means that
  there are four distinct &quot;flats,&quot; and four &quot;bends&quot; of the
  trunk, where the garment may be suppressed to the shape of the figure curves.</p><p>
  Suppression is only practicable and permissible on the &quot;bends&quot;; on
  the &quot;flat&quot; sections it is quite out of the question. For confirmation
  of these statements, examine the sectional views of the figure in Fig. 17.
  These sectional views represent the shape of an actual figure, and the measurements
  denote the positions where the body shape has the &quot;bends&quot; upon which
  suppression is possible and practicable.</p>
  <h5 class="clear">  <em><a href="illust/017.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,638);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/017-t.jpg" alt="Figure 17" width="206" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig17" id="fig17"></a>Figure
  17&#8212;Sectional Views of the Figure Illustrating Waist Suppression</h5>
  <p>Measuring
    on the model as Fig. 17 (a), the width of the chest level is approximately
    8 inches before the back curves round under the arms to the side. At the
    waist line, the width is 7 inches, increasing to 9 inches at the hip level,
    which
      brings us to Fig. 17 (b) showing a side view of the model.</p>
  <p>
  Now many cutters are misled by the apparent shape of the figure from A to B
  and C. This shape, they imagine (as the author was inclined to think once),
  is the shape of the centre back seam, and they endeavour to infuse this curve
  into their drafts, believing that the centre seam so drawn agrees with the
  profile view of the figure at A, B and C.</p><p>
  The profile view is not the shape of the centre back; it is the profile back &quot;flat,&quot; which
  extends from the blades to the hip. If the centre back had a ridge or &quot;bend&quot; down
  it like the profile shape, suppression of the centre back seam would be correct,
  but, in this instance, the profile is the shape of the back at a point towards
  the side where the figure curves to the underarm section. Therefore, as this
  back plane is to all intents and purposes flat, a flat piece of material laid
  over and following the curves of the body would fit perfectly, within the bounds
  of the plane section. It is obviously incorrect and impracticable to suppress
  at the centre back seam in an endeavour to obtain the shape of the figure between
  A, B, and C in Fig. 17 (b), yet there are literally hundreds of scientific
  cutters who use this practice of shaping the centre seam to conform to the
  profile shape of the back.</p>
  <p>
  In Fig. 17 (b) there is a fiat section under the arms from the breast line
  to the waist line, in width approximately 8 &frac12; inches at the top and
  5 inches at the waist level. Below the waist line to the hip level, the hip
  prominence
  shows an increase of size and angle from the &quot;flat&quot; immediately above.
  From Fig. 17 (a) it will be noticed that the side hip projects beyond a vertical
  line from the breast line under the arms from A to B.</p>
  <p>
  To the author's mind this indicates that the quantity of hip overlap and increase
  of size must all be placed at the sides on the underarm seams. Now it is a
  common point in systems to place the hip increase partly at the sideseams and
  partly on the panel seams at the back. Examination of Fig. 17 (b) indicates
  that a vertical line from A to C just touches the hip prominence at the back,
  so, from this fact, hip overlap at the back is deemed to be incorrect except
  in the case of over-development of this section.</p><p>
  The author finds from modelling experience that the increase of size is all
  placed at the underarm seam, and the shape of the section immediately above
  must be reviewed in conjunction.</p>
  <h5 class="clear">  <em><a href="illust/017-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,568);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/017-b-t.jpg" alt="Figure 17 (continued)" width="183" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Figure
  17&#8212;Sectional Views of the Figure Illustrating Waist Suppression (continued)</h5>
  <p>It is apparent from Fig. 17 (b) that there must be suppression to the figure
  curve at A, B and C, which is the &quot;bend&quot; of the trunk for which the
  measures are given in the description of Fig. 17 (a). For all practical purposes,
  and to keep the breast line straight, no suppression can be taken from the
  underarm seam from D to E. This whole section under the scye from the breast
  line to the waist line is approximately a &quot;flat&quot; plane, and there
  is no angle or bend of the body from D to E upon which we can suppress our
  coat to the figure. Coming to the front
  section Fig. 17 (c), there is a plane bounded by the centre of the bust prominences
  at each side, and by the hip points in front. Apart from the provision of bust
  capacity and contour,
  the front section presents least difficulty from the cutting standpoint. The
  dart for waist suppression under the bust runs in a diagonal line from the
  hip prominence to the bust point. These sectional views of the figure can almost
  give an indication of the lines the system will follow if the &quot;bends&quot; of
  the figure are visualized as seam runs.</p>
  <h3><a name="incorrect" id="incorrect"></a>Effect of Incorrect Suppression</h3>
  <p> Let us examine the result of endeavouring to fit the figure shape without
    scientific thought to the location of waist suppression, and its effect on
    the balance
  of the garment elsewhere.</p>
  <h5 class="clear">  <em><a href="illust/018.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,324);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/018-t.jpg" alt="Figure 18" width="101" height="198" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig18" id="fig18"></a>Figure
  18&#8212;Draft Illustrating Incorrect Waist Suppression</h5>
  <p>Fig. 18 shows a coat cut with an underarm seam only for suppression, with no
  darts or panels. This draft will never fit, but is extremely informative as
  to how the fundamental principles behind good cutting are arrived at. There
  have been 2 inches or more taken out of the sideseams, and the hip overlap
  is placed at the sides as shown.</p>
  <p>
  Take the back separately; it is not necessary to baste the sideseams, and endeavour
    to mould it to the figure or stand.</p>
  <p>
  After a little time, it becomes apparent that, if the back fits into the waist
  curve, the underarm seam will not come round to the figure shape, and <em>vice
    versa</em>, if the underarm seam is in position at the side waist, there will
    be a loose amount of material thrown into the hollow of the waist and diagonal
  creases from the side waist to the blade and hip prominences.</p>
  <p>
  There must be a reason for this. The pattern in actual size of bust, waist,
  and hips conforms to the measurements of the figure. So either in the first
  instance there is insufficient length at the side to allow the underseam to
  follow the curve of the figure, or, alternatively, if the sideseam is correct
  there is too much material at the centre back.</p>
  <p>
  This is what is actually taking place. We all know and understand that if a
  hollow seam sews to a straight seam, a flare effect is produced. This is a
  principle of cutting flare effects well known to the trade generally. When
  we suppress an underseam in the manner shown in Fig. 18, we do so contrary
  to the shape of the body at this section as outlined in Fig. 17 (b) from D
  to E and the hip level.</p>
  <p>
  It has been stated that there is no scientific reason why the underarm seam
  may be suppressed, as this section is a flat plane and suppression can only
  be taken out on a &quot;bend&quot; of the figure. By suppressing this seam
  as shown, a flare effect is produced.</p>

  <h5><a name="fig19" id="fig19"></a>Figure 19&#8212;The Effect of Extreme Waist Suppression</h5>
  <h5><a name="fig20" id="fig20"></a>Figure 20&#8212;Further Illustration of Incorrect Waist Suppression</h5>
  <p>Examine Fig. 19, which shows the back and forepart laid together, with the
  underarm seams at the hip line in the sewing position. There is a waist suppression
    of approximately 3&frac12; inches to 4 inches, where no suppression except that
    caused by the overlapping of the seams at the hips is permissible. So it
    is easily understood that when the seams are sewn together an effect takes
    place as in Fig. 20.
  An uncontrollable quantity of length is thrown to the back and front waist,
  the balance of the chest line being absolutely upset. Yet cutters draft garments
  in this way time after time, simply because they imagine the shape of the underarm
  seam is the profile view of the body from A to B in Fig. 17 (a).</p>
  <h3 class="clear">  <em><a href="illust/021.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,274);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/021-t.jpg" alt="Figure 21" width="101" height="240" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig21" id="fig21"></a>Fig. 21</h3>
  <h5>Figure 21&#8212;Fitting the Figure Contours</h5>
  <p>
  Fig. 21 shows what actually occurs when we endeavour to fit the back to the
  figure. Pin the back at the nape of the neck to the blouse or dress and down
  the centre back to the waist and hip level, following the natural curve of
  the trunk. Coming round to the underseam, it must be obvious that, when taking
  the &quot;bend&quot; of the body from A to B in Fig. 17 (b), a straight piece
  of material will be deflected upwards as indicated. A simple test on any stand
  or figure will verify this fact.</p>
  <p>
  The breast and waist lines are raised from their normal horizontal balance
  positions as shown in Fig. 21, and an additional reaction of this &quot;bending&quot; of
  the trunk on the pattern is the consequent displacement of the shoulder end
  and back scye from the normal locations to pass further back on the shoulder,
  causing a certain amount of uncontrolled material to appear in the centre of
  the shoulder.</p><p>
  If the section below the waist to the hip is studied, it will be noticed that
  an identical reaction takes place in the reverse plane, i.e. the balance is
  deflected in a downward angle as the coat follows the &quot;bending&quot; of
  the body from B to C in Fig. 17 (b). The chief points to notice are the dislocation
  of the hip-line balance, an excess quantity of material in the skirt below
  the hips to the hem line and a deficiency at the sideseam below the hip level.</p>
  <h3 class="clear">
  <em><a href="illust/022.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,266);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/022-t.jpg" alt="Figure 22" width="100" height="244" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig22" id="fig22"></a>Fig. 22</h3>
  <h5>Figure 22&#8212;The Effect at the Sideseam</h5>
  <p>
  A study of Fig. 22 gives the clue to waist suppression. It is obvious that
  the coat, to fit closely to the curve of the trunk from centre back to side
  waist, must have an extra amount of length at the underarm seam, equal to the
  quantity the underarm seam shows a deficit at the sideseam, which is caused
  by the straight balance lines taking opposing angles as they pass round the
  bends of the body.</p><p>
  This is the crux of the matter, and the secret of fit. There must be a comparative
  extra amount of length infused into the underarm seam, to enable the coat to
  follow the opposing curves of the trunk round to the sideseam, with consequent
  adjustments of other sections in their correct positions.</p>
  <h3 class="clear">
  <em><a href="illust/023.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,415);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/023-t.jpg" alt="Figure 23" width="132" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig23" id="fig23"></a>Fig. 23</h3>
  <h5>Figure 23&#8212;Remodelling the Back Pattern</h5>
  <p>
  Let us examine our original pattern of the back in a flat plane, with the knowledge
  acquired from modelling the back to the figure. In Fig. 21 an apparent deficiency
  is seen at the sideseam, equal to approximately 1&frac12; inches. Therefore,
    from this, the waist line or seam must be lowered &frac34; inch on the above
    waist section,
  and raised &frac34; inch on the section below the waist as indicated by the dash
    lines in Fig. 23.</p>
  <p>
  A wedge must be let in at the waist line from 1&frac12; inches at the underarm
    seam to practically nothing at the &quot;bends&quot; of
  the body represented in Fig. 17 (b).</p>
  <p>
  The shoulder section on the model indicated how the breast balance line was
  raised out of position in Fig. 22 to show an excess amount of material in the
  centre of the shoulder, after the shoulder end had been passed back.</p><p>
  To correct the deflection of the breast-line balance, and reduce the length
  of the underarm seam to the waist, the breast line must be lowered and re-marked
  from the point where commencement of the deflection becomes apparent.</p>
  <p>
  Therefore, in Fig. 23 the breast line is lowered from A to 7, making 7 to 5
  equal the original side seam from 1 to 6. Following up this reasoning, owing
    to the re-marking of the breast line from A to 7, the back-width construction
  line must be re-squared from this line, to relocate the shoulder end in its
    correct position, after it has been passed back. There still remains the
    quantity of excess material at 3
  to 4, but, at the moment, in the light of further knowledge, this amount will
  not be taken into account.</p>
  <p>
  In dealing with the section below the waist, the hip balance line has become
  lowered and distorted, consequently throwing excess material into the skirt,
  with a deficiency of side skirt at the underarm seam below the hip point.</p>
  <p>
  To reconstruct the hip section, the hip balance line has to be relocated in
  distance from the waist line; so 9 from 11 is made equal to 6 to 8, and the
  hip balance line is raised from C to 9, parallel with B to 11. By squaring
    from C to 12, and C to 13, the amount of excess material in the skirt is
    located,
  for when the re-marked hip line becomes a straight line as the natural shape
  of the figure from the waist to the hips in Fig. 22 deflects the balance lines
    into their horizontal straightness, the quantity 12 to 13 becomes unnecessary
    at this point, yet is required to
  be added (at the sideseam) to make up the deficiency from 14 to 15.</p>
  <h3 class="clear">  <em><a href="illust/024.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,400);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/024-t.jpg" alt="Figure 24" width="127" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig24" id="fig24"></a>Fig. 24</h3>
  <h5>Figure 24&#8212;Reconstruction of the Pattern</h5>
  <p>
  Examine the reconstructed pattern in two sections as shown in Fig. 24 (a) and
    (b). We can now manipulate the pattern to eliminate the faults shown by the
    shaded sections. The upper section is split up from
  B to A, and from where the excess material in the centre of the shoulder terminates
  at D. This quantity, 3 to 4, is reduced until the reconstructed breast line
  once more becomes a straight line as shown in Fig. 24 (b) from A to 7.</p>
  <p>
  By resquaring down from A to 7 to E, it is apparent that the underarm seam
  waist suppression has become practically nil, instead of the 1 inch or more
  on the original draft, whilst at the &quot;bend&quot; of the back from D, A,
  to B, a large quantity has been suppressed, bearing out the author's contention
  that suppression is only correct at the &quot;bends&quot; of the body, and
  not on the flat sections at the back, nor under the arms.</p>
  <p>
  To adjust the balance of the skirt section to horizontal hip and waist construction
  lines, the excessive material in the skirt from 12 to 13 must be reduced by
  splitting up the pattern from B to C, and overlapping 12 to 13. This quantity
  has been added at 14 to 15, so the skirt width is as originally drafted, but
  instead of the excessive round over the hip of the seam at 9, we have a very
  gradual run of seam that fits perfectly, while at the &quot;bends&quot; of
  the back from B to C, there is a suppression equal to the amount shown at B
  on the above-waist section.</p><p>
  It must now be conceded that suppression is scientifically incorrect at the
  underarm section; the only true position for suppressing to the figure is at
  the &quot;bends&quot; of the trunk on the back panel seam. Also exaggerated
  hip runs are out of keeping with the shape of the body from the waist to the
  hip; there is an increase of prominence beyond the vertical line from under
  the arm, yet by no stretch of imagination is there such a &quot;round&quot; to
  need some of the seam runs the author has observed drafted for covering.</p><p>
  The underarm seam must always remain in its drafted position and equal in length
  to the other sections. Equal length is stated, but as it has been proved that
  extra length is needed, this may be a trifle confusing. What is really meant
  is that a comparative increase of material is created by an operation elsewhere,
  to provide length for enabling the curving round of the body to be covered
  without distortion.</p><p>
  Comparatively more length of the underarm seam is required to allow the back
  section to come to the figure, and, as the coat passes round the opposing inclines
  of the body, our created extra length is taken up in fitting the underarm section
  shape.</p>
  <p>
  Many systems indent at the centre back seam at A and B in Fig. 17 (b), an endeavour
  being made, when the seam is sewn out, to create extra length in the underarm
  seam at D to E. Cutters following this practice do not take into account the
    extra length thrown up at A, and the disturbance of the breast line to an
    angle, instead of being a straight line.</p>
  <h3><a name="front" id="front"></a>Suppression at the Front Waist</h3>
  <p> At the front of the figure, waist suppression takes a subsidiary place
    in proportion to the greater problems of bust contour capacity and the location
    of the neck
  point.</p><p>
  There is need for suppression under the bust, to create length at the sideseam,
  in harmony with the back; but this need is not so great, as there is nothing
  approaching the hollow curve of the back, in the shape of the front waist.</p><p>
  From practical experience of measuring many women, the author finds that the
  back waist width is generally about 2 inches smaller than the front width,
  measured from a point central on the waist line under the arms. Therefore,
  the front-waist suppression is of insignificant importance in comparison with
  the back-waist requirements.</p>
  <p>
  With the average figure we have under review, the hip prominence lies practically
  beneath a vertical line down from the waist point, and the waist may be suppressed
  to the extent of &frac34; inch to clear the material between the two prominences,
  and create a certain amount of extra length at the underarm seam in the waist
  hollow.</p>
  <p>
  In the case of extreme development of the bust, apart from the size of waist
  and hips, a vertical line taken from the bust point will show the front waist
  and hip points to have receded; therefore, the material under the bust needs
  reducing before a close-fitting front is achieved. This point is fully dealt
  with by the basis diagram and system for Development of Bust Prominence from
  Normal (see <a href="lgcm-03.html#bust">Fig. 12</a>).</p>
  <p>
  The question of waist suppression having been scientifically decided, it may
  be said that all coats are not panelled, and what then? Quite right! but in
  the author's opinion, waist suppression and fit are of more importance than
  the question of seam placement. We must have suppression, if we require a good-fitting
  coat, and it is the height of impracticability to ignore the factor of suppression
  if we cannot apply it to the design as a panel seam.</p>
  <p>
  Design must be fitted to the system, and not the system to the design. It has
  been said by some cutters, &quot;The design does not permit waist suppression,
  so we must do without.&quot; What a great lack of scientific thought! They
  are deliberately sacrificing the fit of their garments, and knowingly doing
  so. We cannot say that the design does not permit suppression, that the design
  is too intricate.</p>
  <p>
  There obviously <em>must </em>be waist suppression if the coat is to be close-fitting.
  Design is subsidiary to fit, and suppression is as necessary when there are
  two seams in a panel back as in the case of an intricate design of ten or so
  pieces.</p>
  <p>
  Admittedly, as the design becomes more cut about, the suppression presents
  more difficulties, but that, in itself, is not a good enough reason for shirking
  the issue altogether. In the opinion of the author, if he dared to do so, the
  ghosts of those missing suppressions would haunt him for a long time!</p><p>
  When we are given a design for a close-fitting coat, suppression is essential,
  so one must become a &quot;manipulative&quot; cutter, operating on the pattern
  draft to gain the effect from the knowledge obtained from modelling experience.</p><p>
  One might drape a model to fit perfectly on a stand or the human figure, and
  mark thereon an intricate design, the design being transposed afterwards to
  a flat plane by being traced off on to pattern paper. One would then have the
  sure knowledge that no matter what the design, suppression would be taken out,
  to create the needed extra length at the sidearms for covering the figure contours
  correctly.</p><p>
  It is necessary to transmit this knowledge to a flat plane when drafting a
  pattern, and if we bear in mind always the need for creation of length at the
  side-seam by back-waist suppression, we will begin to achieve the perfection
  for which we all strive.</p>
  <p>
  This factor is of major importance. It is a sorry point that many of our scientific
  cutters argue for hours on neck points and balance, yet have the foggiest ideas
  or methods for defining the waist, preferring to adjust matters at the &quot;try-on.&quot; In
  the author's opinion, every garment should leave the cutter's hands and shears
  in a &quot;cut to finish&quot; state, as though a &quot;try-on&quot; was an
  impossibility. It is the knowledge that accidents can be rectified later, at
  the fitting, which lowers the standard of cutting. If every cutter had to cut
  his job for a &quot;finish,&quot; a much-needed overhauling of systems would
  follow, and a consequent raising of the standard of cutting.</p>
  <h3><a name="contours" id="contours"></a>Fitting the Figure Contours</h3>
  <p>    These days, women are very particular about the fitting qualities of
    their garments, particularly in the waist section. The present trend of fashion
    and
  design calls for a high standard of cutting ability, for garments either have
  to fit perfectly or else faults are glaringly exaggerated, for the notion of
  a good fit in the minds of women these days is extreme to the point of faddiness.
  They do not appreciate a surplus amount of material in the back waist, or a
  little &quot;round&quot; for ease over the hips. Too often complaints are made
  that their coats wing away from the front as they walk, yet having ample material
  over the hip size, or else the coat will not go into the waist at the sides,
  or if pulled into position sets up a flared-skirt effect at the back and diagonal
  creases from the side waist to the blades and front of the armhole.</p>
  <p>
  These two instances are caused by incorrect allocation of the waist-suppression
  factor with resultant lack of length at the side waist to enable the other
  sections of the body&#8212;the prominences of bust, blade and hips&#8212;to
  take up material for covering without causing stress or strain from the side
  waist.</p><p>
  It is that little amount of created length at the sideseams which enables a
  well-cut coat to fit the  curves of the figure naturally and evenly
  without distortion and, even if the garment is worn open, still retain the
  original shape. On the wearer, as each section of the coat becomes adjusted
  to the body, the balance of the garment is adapted to the needs of the figure
  and there is actually no more length at one section than another, though each
  has sufficient length for the purpose of following the curve of the body.</p>
  <p>
  Coming back to the statement that all coats are not panelled and so suppressions
  based upon this style do not always apply when cutting other styles, a panel
  coat is the criterion of fit; the waist suppressions are in their logically
  correct positions, and are fixed and unalterable. The systems described are
  based on the panel-coat system as being correct; therefore, we must adapt all
  seam placement variations to this basis of suppression.</p>
  <p>
  It has been stated that indenting the centre seam for waist suppression is
  unscientific to the degree that prevails in practice, and not in accordance
  with the shape of the figure at this section. Another point is the question
  of hip overlap. This factor has been definitely located as a surplus on the
  draft at the underarm seam only. If an underarm seam is not required, however,
  is it logic to move this surplus side quantity towards the back approximately
  4 inches? This is the general practice, but there is only one definite position
  for this quantity, and to endeavour to transpose this factor elsewhere is to
  cause complications as shown by Fig. 16 (a). This change of location results
  in a shortness from the side hip to the bust and blade prominences, and it
  is directly the cause of many ill-fitting garments. It is quite obvious that
  a loss of 1&frac12; inches over the most prominent part of the hip at the side
  will be reflected in the fit elsewhere. We might as well allow for increased
  contour capacity for the bust by an addition at the sideseam only.</p>
  <p>
  The author thinks that all ladies' coats should be cut with an underarm sideseam,
  but if there is reason to change this ruling, let us at least be logical and
  adhere to the basic principles of construction, which explains why the forepart
  of a block-fronted coat is opened to allow for the hip overlap at the side
  as in the basis draft for panel coats.</p><p>
  Cutters are chary of darts as a means of improving fitting quality. But we
  have only to see the extensive use French designers make of darts to achieve
  their effect to realize that in the attainment of a good-fitting garment darts
  are as essential as panel seams, in as much as if we cannot have one, we must
  have the other for obtaining style and closely-moulded line.</p><p>
  Those elusive qualities, style and line, which are recognizable in a garment,
  making it alive and part of the living form in wear, are characteristics that
  all cutters may infuse into their productions if a study of the human-figure
  construction is made. To be a good cutter, one must be also something of an
  artist with a working knowledge of form in order to visualize the line he is
  imparting to his pattern in its relationship to the body. A famous English
  designer once remarked, &quot;I do not care whether a dress or coat looks
  anything or not on a hanger or stand, but it must become alive and move with
  the movement of the body when worn.&quot; That is the secret of style and line&#8212;the
  harmonious blending of seams with the actual shape of the figure.</p>
  <p>
  There should not be any excuse for unharmonious line if we keep the form and
  proportions of the wearer in mind when drafting out the pattern. We endeavour
  to impart an illusion of curves and shapeliness to the too slender by curving
  seamings instead of angles or vertical lines; in like manner we try to give
  the appearance of slenderness to possessors of unwieldy proportions by accentuating
  height with vertical seams and cutting across width with sharp angles of design.
  A high-closing neck line or narrow lapels are attributes of slimness in relation
  to the well-built person, and similarly the slender woman may wear square-cut
  revers and shoulders with assurance and confidence that her appearance is considerably
  enhanced by the breaking up of a too elongated silhouette.</p><p>
  Design in dress is akin to design in architecture and interior decoration.
  At the moment, the general influence is for purity of line over &quot;fussiness
  of detail,&quot; which means that, with less detail and trimming to distract
  the attention, the actual fitting qualities of the garment will be in the limelight.
  To compensate for the simplicity of the design, perfect fitting is necessary
  so that the garment is moulded to the form and takes to itself a character
  that is individual and one with the wearer. In the days of loosely-fitting
  garments, design had to take the place of line and good fit, the opportunities
  for imparting individuality were limited and cutting was not so difficult from
  the cutter's standpoint.</p>
  <p>
  The straight up-and-down knee-length coats and dresses worn in the middle 'twenties
  relied entirely upon intricate and fussy design to achieve an effect, so the
  requisite cutting skill necessary was directed to the interpretation of design
    instead of the achievement of a close fit. Loose-fitting styles of to-day
    are not easy to cut, and to imagine that their
  straight character simplifies cutting problems is quite erroneous; the lack
  of fit has to be nullified by an attainment of &quot;swing&quot; or &quot;swagger&quot; in
  the cut and hang of the back from the shoulders.</p>

  <h5>Figure 25&#8212;Analysis of Waist Suppression Principles</h5>
  <p> Fig. 25 illustrates very clearly the adverse effects of reducing waist
    suppression from the sideseams only in preference to the correct locations
    at side back
    and front.</p>
  <p>
    Point X is the back neck as usual, and the side-seams are indicated in firm
    lines with the standard quantity of waist suppression indicated from 1 to
    2; 1 from 2 equals &frac34; inch. Point 3 is the bust prominence and point 4
      the front
    neck point.</p>
  <p>
    Now as the quantity of waist suppression taken out, as points 1 to 2, is
    correct for the figure, a certain length must be registered from the sideseam
    at 2
    to the bust prominence at 3 and continued to 4. Similarly, at the back, the
    length from 1 to X over the blade prominence is the correct length required
    to cover the contour shape of the back from the nape of the neck to the side
    waist.</p>
  <p>
    If the sideseams are suppressed more than the standard quantity, as 6 to
    5, 1 inch each side from the centre line, the length from 5 to 3 and 4 will
    therefore
    be less than from 2 to 3 and 4. At the back, the distance from 6 to X over
    the blades from the side waist will be less than 1 to 2.</p>
  <p>
    As a result of this reduction in length from the waist to the back and front
    neck points, when the garment is placed on the figure, this shortage will
    cause diagonal creases from the side waist to the blades and bust prominence
    as there
    will not be sufficient length to enable the side waist to assume its correct
    position on the figure. As the waist cannot lie smoothly in the side hollow,
    there will be an excess of size over the hips and loose material in the back
    waist hollow drawn up by the shortness of length from the bust prominence
    to the side waist. This is the effect of attempting to take an excessive
    quantity
    of material from the sideseams in an endeavour to obtain a fitting garment.</p><p>
    On the other hand, study the effects of taking the waist suppression from
    the garment in the correct positions.</p>
    <p>
    7 from 8 indicates a similar quantity to 2 to 5, being reduced only under
    the bust prominence at the front panel seam; 9 from 10 indicates a quantity
    of
    1&frac12; inches taken from the back panel seam, a quantity incidentally in
      excess of the suppression indicated from 1 to 6. Now it must be obvious
      that whatever
    quantity is reduced from 9 to 10, the length over the blade prominence from
      the back neck to the side-seam at 1 remains unchanged, so that this length
      ensures a correct balance of the sections, while the
    fitting quality is achieved by suppression in the correct location at the
    side back
    panel. A very hollow-waisted figure still requires as much length over the
    blade prominence from the side to the centre back neck as a figure of more
    stolid build. By retaining this length correctly, we are able to suppress
    the garment to the figure at the back panels and obtain a perfectly balanced
    and
    fitting shape. </p>
    <p>At the fronts, the side length from the waist over the bust prominence
      to the neck point remains of constant dimension no matter what quantity
      is reduced from the front waist in the panel seam or by darts.
    By this length, the waist goes to the figure at the side, the garment over
    the hips wraps closely to enable the front wrap-over to hang without winging
    away, and fitting quality is achieved without the expense of a disturbed
    balance.</p>
    <p>
    It is only possible to suppress a larger quantity at the sideseams than indicated
    when the material is cut on the bias, and then the natural pliability of
    the bias is intended to assume the shape of the figure.</p><p>

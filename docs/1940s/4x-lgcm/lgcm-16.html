  </p>
  <p>IT is quite a new departure in works on cutting to describe the drafting
of <em>n&eacute;glig&eacute;</em> garments, including underslips, dressing-gowns,
knickers and
tailored cami-knickers. The term &quot;tailored lingerie&quot; is a true
one in the sense that it indicates that the garments are as well cut as a
tailored garment, in contrast to the more shapeless, ill-fitting articles of
clothing on the market. This chapter is concerned only with
&quot;tailored&quot; undergarments, and the systems described for the cutting
of <em>n&eacute;glig&eacute;</em> garments have been used with great success.</p>
  <p>The extreme interest modern women take in the faultless cut and fit of
their day and evening ensembles is reflected in their leisure-hour attire,
for no longer are they content with shapeless garments, preferring instead
perfect fit and style. Especially is this the case since the advent of the
streamline mode for day and evening, for every crease or wrinkle of the
foundation garments shows under the closely-fitting dress if the undergarment
is not as perfectly fitting as the outer garments. The foundation garment is
really the &quot;foundation&quot; of a smart appearance, and must be well
cut.</p>
<p>Dressing-gowns have graduated from the wrapper stage to become imbued with
design in many diverse ways. The Russian influence is shown by high-closing
neck lines, wide revers and decorative sleeves contributing their quota of
style, while the standard roll-collar dressing-gown is a perennial
favourite.</p>
<p>Underslips are cut on the moulded line to fit the figure without any
wrinkles or surplus material by means of bias cutting. A curving waist seam
or panel seams assist the cutter in achieving the desired close fit, and
darts to the bust keep the top edge close to the figure and provide a
brassiere effect.</p>
<p>The author cuts knickers and cami-knickers on the shorts principle, with
the fork section cut in one with the body part, instead of the usual method
of insetting a triangular gusset between the legs. This method gives a much
better all-round fitting garment, and, in the opinion of the majority of
women, a much more comfortable garment. Bed and beach pyjamas are cut on the
trousers principle, with either elastic or a shaped hip yoke at the waist.</p>
<h3><a name="gown" id="gown"></a>DRESSING-GOWNS</h3>
<h3><em><a href="illust/215.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,327);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/215-t.jpg" alt="Figure 215" width="102" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig215" id="fig215"></a>Dressing-gown Draft (Fig. 215)</h3>
<p>The system for drafting the dressing-gown is that used for dresses, with a
slightly greater allowance over the half-bust measure for additional ease. No
seams are allowed in the draft, but when the garment is being cut from the
material &frac12; inch provision should be made for lapped seams.</p>
<p>The draft illustrates the graceful lines of a modern dressing-gown
designed in the roll-collar style. The roll collar may be stereotyped, but
the effect of the fronts wrapping over a greater distance at the hem than at
the waist resembles the &quot;swagger&quot; lines of a military uniform. The
waisted cut is another feature, being defined in excess of most notions. But
if the dressing-gown is made to measure, it is absurd to cut the garment as
though it were intended to fit anyone varying inches in size. In the
wholesale trade, such allowance for fitting many wearers is permissible, but
if the garment is specially cut to a particular figure, the author believes
in interpreting the term &quot;tailored dressing-gown&quot; as meaning a
fitting dressing-gown.</p>
<p>Measures for the draft are as follows&#8212;</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>Chest = 34 inches.</li>
	<li>Bust = 36 inches.</li>
	<li>Waist = 28 inches.</li>
	<li>Hips = 40 inches.</li>
	<li>Natural waist length = 15 inches.</li>
	<li>Full gown length = 50 inches.</li>
	<li>Sleeve length = 29 inches.</li>
	<li>Half-back width = 6&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>Working scale = half the bust girth = 18 inches.</li>
	</ul>
<p>Square from X</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>1 from X = the back depth = one-third of the scale plus 1&frac12;
inches.</li>
	<li>2 from X = the natural waist length = 15 inches.</li>
	<li>3 from 2 = 8 inches down for the hip level.</li>
	<li>4 from X = the full gown length.</li>
	<li>5 from X = the back neck width = one-sixth of the scale less &frac14;
inch.</li>
	<li>Square up from 5 to 6 the height of the back neck curve i.e. &frac34;
inch.</li>
	<li>Shape from 6 to X.</li>
	<li>7 from 1 = the half-back width net.</li>
	<li>Square up from 7 to 8 on the line squared out from X.</li>

	<li>12 from 10 = one-twelfth of the scale.</li>
	<li>13 from 9 = half the scale less &frac34; inch.</li>
	<li>14 from 13 = one-sixth of the scale.</li>
	<li>Square up from 14 to locate point 15 on the line squared out from 12.
This procedure is the same as described for coats when a shoulder dart is not
used.</li>
	<li>16 is midway of 9 to 13.</li>
	<li>17 from 16 = 2 inches.</li>
	<li>Line from 17 to 12.</li>
	<li>18 from 12 = one-twelfth of the scale to determine the quantity to be
reduced from the gorge dart.</li>
	<li>19 from 17 = one-fourth of the scale.</li>
	<li>Join 19 to 18.</li>
	<li>20 from 8 = 1 inch.</li>
	<li>21 from 20 = &frac12; inch. Shape the back shoulder seam from 21 to 6.</li>
	<li>Join 15 to 21.</li>
	<li>22 from 15 = the front shoulder width equal to the back shoulder width
from 21 to 6 less &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>Square down from 22 to 23 1 inch, and shape the front shoulder seam from
23 to 15.</li>
	<li>24 from 7 for the position of the sideseam = 2 inches.</li>
	<li>Square down from 24 to 25, 26 and 27 at the hem line.</li>
	<li>28 from 25 = 3/8 inch.</li>
	<li>29 from 25 = 3/8 inch.</li>
	<li>Overlap at the hip line from 26 to 30 and 31 by half the difference
between the bust and hip measures less &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>32 from 27 = 26 to 31 plus 1&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>33 from 27 = 26 to 30 plus 1&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>Shape the sideseams from 24 to 29 and 30 and from 24 to 28 and 31, then
continuing down to 32 and 33 at the hem line.</li>
	<li>Deepen the scye &frac12; inch from 7 to 34 and 13 to 35 and shape the scye,
hollowing &frac14; inch in advance of the scye line squared up from 13.</li>
	<li>36 from 11 = &frac14; inch. Shape the centre line from 9 through 36 to 37 at
the hem line.</li>
	<li>38 from 36 = 4 inches for the front edge overlap.</li>
	<li>39 from 37 = 6 inches for the front edge overlap at the hem line.</li>
	<li>40 from 39 = 3 inches.</li>
	<li>41 from 37 = 1&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>Shape the cut-away bottom edge run from 40 to 41 and 32 at the forepart
sideseam.</li>
	<li>42 from 15 = 1 inch collar stand. Shape the crease line from 42 to 38 at
the waist line, breaking squarely at the gorge dart from 12 and 18 to 19.</li>
	<li>43 from 12 = one-sixth of the scale.</li>
	<li>Shape the gorge run from 43 to 15 as shown by lining through from 44, 1&frac12; inches
	  below 15.</li>
	<li>45 from 43 = 2&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>46 from 9 = 5 inches for the shape of the lapels.</li>
	<li>Shape from 38 to 46 and 45.</li>
	<li>47 from 2 = 4 inches.</li>
	<li>Mark out a 1 inch suppression dart at 47 8 inches in length.</li>
	<li>48 from 29 = 4 inches.</li>
	<li>Mark out a &frac34; inch dart at 48 6 inches in length.</li>
	</ul>
<p>The draft of the dressing-gown is now completed.</p>
<p>It is not necessary to include a sleeve system. The basic system will
satisfy the needs of the deeper scye if the drafting principle of measuring
the depth of the scye from the back pitch to the scye base and then
subtracting &frac12; inch for the sleeve depth is adhered to.</p>
<p>The facing and collar for this design are cut as described in the chapter
on <a href="lgcm-13.html">collar cutting</a> under the heading of &quot;The Roll or Shawl
Collar.&quot;</p>

<h3><em><a href="illust/216.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,325);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/216-t.jpg" alt="Figure 216" width="102" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig216" id="fig216"></a>Draft of an Underslip (Fig. 216)</h3>
<p>The draft illustrated by Fig. 216 is that of a slim-fitting underslip,
designed with a curving waist seam and a plain bias-cut skirt. The fronts are
vandyked to form the shoulder strap positions for sewing, and at the back the
top edge may either be straight-cut or cut away to a low back line.</p>
<p>The manipulation of the pattern is necessary to produce a perfect garment
and this must not be neglected. From his experience, the author knows that it
is impossible to cut a fitting garment by reducing the waist to a close
measure at the sideseams only, and the little extra work entailed by cutting
up the outline pattern and closing out the waist suppression is amply repaid
in the finished garment.</p>
<p>The system allows for the top of the underslip to fit just under the arm
level so as to permit lace edgings to be overlaid. In any case, it is a
simple matter to adjust the top-edge level on the wearer.</p>
<p>Measures for the draft are as follows&#8212;</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>Bust = 34 inches.</li>
	<li>Hips = 37 inches.</li>
	<li>Waist = 26 inches.</li>
	<li>Full length from the waist line to the hem = 30 inches.</li>
	<li>Working scale = half the bust girth = 17 inches.</li>
	</ul>
<p>Square from X at the breast line.</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>1 from X = 7&frac12; inches for the natural waist level.</li>
	<li>2 from 1 = 8 inches for the hip level.</li>
	<li>3 from 1 = the slip length measured from the waist line = 30 inches.</li>
	<li>Square out from the above points.</li>
	<li>4 from 2 = half the hip measure net.</li>
	<li>Square up from 4 to 5 and 6 and down from 4 to 7 at the hem line.</li>
	<li>8 is half 2 to 4. Square up from 8 to 9 and 10 and down from 8 to
11.</li>
	<li>Measure from 6 to 12 half the bust measure plus &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>Reduce the surplus shown at 12 to X from the sideseams at 13 and 14 from
10.</li>
	<li>15 from 14 = one-twelfth of the scale less &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>16 from 6 = one-sixth of the scale.</li>
	<li>Join 16 to 15.</li>
	<li>Square down from 13 to 17 and 14 to 18.</li>
	<li>19 from 17 = &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>20 from 18 = &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>21 from 11 = 1&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>22 from 11 = 1&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>Shape the sideseams from &frac12; inch inside 15 to 20, 8 and 22 and from 13
to 19, 8 and 21.</li>
	<li>23 from 1 = half the waist measure (26 inches) plus 2 inches for ease
plus the distance from 19 to 20.</li>
	<li>Square up from 16 to 25 2&frac12; inches for the shoulder-strap point.</li>
	<li>26 from 15 = &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>Shape from 6 to 25 and from 25 to 26.</li>
	<li>Shape down from 26 to 27 one-sixth of the scale for the position of the
bust dart.</li>
	<li>28 from 27 = the quantity indicated from 14 to 15.</li>
	<li>Shape the bust dart 4 inches in length from 27 and 28 to 29.</li>
	<li>30 from 5 = 3&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>31 from 20 = 3&frac12; inches for the position of the front waist
suppression lines.</li>
	<li>24 from 23 = two-thirds of the distance from 23 to 5 for the back waist
suppression.</li>
	<li>Shape out the front waist suppression from 31 to 29, and shape the high
waist seam from 30 to the sideseam at 20, breaking at the suppression lines
at 32 and 33.</li>
	<li>34 from 1 = one-sixth of the scale plus &frac12; inch for the position of the
back waist suppression.</li>
	<li>Reduce the suppression quantity indicated from 23 to 24 at 35 and 36
from 34.</li>
	<li>Square up from 34 to the top edge line and down to 37 at the hip level
and 38 at the hem line.</li>
	<li>39 is where the line squared up from 34 touches the breast line.</li>
	<li>Square down from 31 to 40 and 41 for the manipulation lines on the front
skirt.</li>
	</ul>
<p>This completes the draft of the underslip style with a high back line.</p>
<p>For a low back&#8212;</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>42 from 26 = &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>43 from 13 = &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>44 from 1 = 2&frac12; inches. Shape the low back line from 43 to 44,
breaking at the suppression lines as indicated at 45 and 46.</li>
	</ul>
<h3><a name="waist" id="waist"></a>Manipulation of the Outline Pattern for
Waist Suppression</h3>
<p>Cut through the waist seam from 19 to 1 and up the manipulation lines from
35 and 36 to 39. Close out the waist suppression and re-mark round the
outline of the back pattern to give a reconstructed bodice for both high and
low back lines.</p>
<p>Cut down the manipulation lines from 35 and 36 to 37 and up from 38 to 37.
Close out the waist suppression from 36 to 35 to open the skirt width at the
hem line and reconstruct the back skirt section.</p>
<p>The front of the underslip may have the bust dart only, or the contour
shape so provided may be transferred to the waist seam or down from the top
edge of the fronts, by cutting through from 32 and 33 to 29 or from A to 29.
If the dart is required at A, close out both the side dart and the waist
suppression to open the dart line from A to 29. Similarly, if darts are
required in the waist from the seam upwards, close out the sideseam dart from
27 to 28 to open the suppression lines from 29 to 32 and 33. The quantity
indicated at 32 to 33 by this manipulation may be reduced by two or three
darts instead of a single large dart and a smart effect will be achieved.</p>
<p>Close out the skirt waist suppression by moving point 32 to 33, pivoting
from 40, and thereby causing the skirt to open at the hem line from 41.</p>

<p>The cami-knicker draft presented is intended as a basis for variation of
design, and no pretence has been made to elaborate the system or to describe
a definite style.</p>
<p>As a basic outline, this draft can be adapted to any style of
cami-knickers cut with the fork extension in one with the skirt section.</p>
<p>A hip yoke is included in the basic draft to demonstrate a characteristic
style feature, and the skirt sections below are cut on the bias of the
material without a sideseam.</p>
<p>Measures for the draft are as follows&#8212;</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>Bust = 34 inches.</li>

the bodice section and from the front hip yoke. If a greater amount of flare
is required in the skirt section, this should be cut through and opened out
as described in the drafts of dresses with flared skirts.</p>

	  in
two darts as indicated at 42 and 43, each dart being 3&frac12; inches in
length.</li>
	<li>44 from 21 = &frac12; inch, the amount added to the quantity reduced from the

47.</li>

	</ul>
<p>After the back waist suppression has been closed out from 33 to 34 and 46
to 47, the bodice section from 45 to 1, 31 and 30 may be cut in one piece
with the hip-yoke section, indicated by points 31 to 25, 30 and 53, on the
fold of the material.</p>
<p>The lower draft shows the skirt sections laid in position to be cut
without a sideseam from 53 and 51 to 25 and 26.</p>
<p>To obtain a skirted effect at the centre front and back, cut through the
pattern from 9 to 52 and 11 to 30 and insert a 1&frac12;-inch flare wedge at
each
point.</p>
<p>The skirt section should be cut on the bias of the material for a
slim-line effect.</p>
<p>It will be noticed that the front waist suppression quantity has been
ignored on this draft, but it is not advisable to cut garments of this type
too close-fitting; otherwise, they will be found difficult to get into
without a side opening, unless they are cut entirely on the bias.</p>

<p>Figs. 221 (a) and (b) show the drafting of two varieties of pyjamas. The
first draft illustrates pyjamas cut without a sideseam on the crease of the
material and loose-fitting at the waist, elastic being relied on to draw the
surplus material to the figure. This style of pyjama is made without a
sideseam opening, so that the waist must be sufficiently large to enable the
garment to pass over the hip line.</p>
<p>The second draft is cut on modern pyjama lines. The waist is fitted by
small darts at the front and back, and a sideseam with an opening makes
possible more shape in the legs.</p>

<h3><a name="bias" id="bias"></a>LINGERIE CUT ON THE BIAS</h3>
<h3><em><a href="illust/222.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,592);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/222-t.jpg" alt="Figure 222" width="191" height="195" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig222" id="fig222"></a>Bias-cut Cami-knickers (Fig. 222)</h3>
<p>The draft of cami-knickers here presented is suitable for bias cutting
only, for the waist suppression is reduced entirely from the sideseams in
contradistinction to usual standards, and it is only possible to do this when
the garment is so cut on the cross, which enables the material to assume the
shape of the figure without any drags or folds of surplus material.</p>
<p>It is advisable, when designing bias-cut garments, to keep all the design
seams at an angle of forty-five degrees from the vertical, so that, when the
pattern outline is placed on the bias of the material, these design seams
will all be on the &quot;straight&quot; and twisting of the various sections
will be minimized.</p>
<p>The design of these cami-knickers embodies a brassiere-top effect and
diagonal seams from the side-seams to the centre front and back.</p>
<p>Measures for the draft are as follows&#8212;</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>Waist = 26 inches.</li>
	<li>Hips = 37 inches.</li>
	<li>Sideseam length from the waist to the leg = 16&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>Inside leg length = 5 inches.</li>
	<li>Body-rise length = 11&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>Working scale = half the hip measure = 18&frac12; inches.</li>
	</ul>
<p>To draft&#8212;</p>
<p>Square from X.</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>1 from X = the length from the breast line to the waist = 7&frac14;
inches.</li>
	<li>2 from 1 = the hip level from the waist line = 8 inches down.</li>
	<li>3 from 1 = the body-rise length = 11&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>4 from 3 = the leg length = 5 inches.</li>
	<li>Square out from the above points.</li>
	<li>5 from 2 = half the hip measure plus 1 inch for ease.</li>
	<li>Square up from 5 to 6 and 7 and down to 8.</li>
	<li>9 from 8 = the front fork quantity of one-sixth of the scale plus &frac12;
inch.</li>
	<li>Shape the fork run from 9 to 6.</li>
	<li>Square down from 9 to 10 the inside leg length of 5 inches.</li>
	<li>Measure from 7 to 11 half the bust measure net.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>No addition has been made for ease over the bust measure as the author
finds that with bias-cut garments they need to be cut to the exact size,
otherwise there is a tendency for the weight of the garments to drop and pull
the bodice part out of position.</p>
<p>Cutting the garment to the exact size or even slightly smaller causes the
bias to stretch outwards instead of dropping downwards.</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>The sideseam is located at 12, half the distance from 7 to X.</li>
	<li>Reduce the surplus quantity from X to 11 from the side-seams at 12 to A
and B.</li>
	<li>Square down from 12 to 13 and 14 on the lines squared out from 1 and
2.</li>
	<li>Square down from A to 15.</li>
	<li>16 from 15 = 1&frac14; inches.</li>
	<li>Square down from B to 17.</li>
	<li>18 from 17 = 1&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>Shape the front sideseam from A to 16 and the back sideseam from B to
18.</li>
	<li>19 from 3 = the distance from 8 to 9.</li>
	<li>20 from 19 = the back fork quantity of 2&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>Square down from 20 to 21 the inside leg length of 5 inches.</li>
	<li>22 from 3 = 1 inch.</li>
	<li>23 from 3 = one-fourth of the waist measure.</li>
	<li>24 from the waist line = 1&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>Line the seat angle from 22 through 23 to 24.</li>
	<li>25 from 24 = the length from 1 to 18.</li>
	<li>Shape from 25 and 16 to 14 for the sideseams.</li>
	<li>26 from B = &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>Square across from 26 to 27 for the top edge.</li>
	<li>28 from 7 = one-sixth of the scale plus &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>Measure up 2&frac12; inches from 28 to 29.</li>
	<li>Shape from 7 to 29.</li>
	<li>30 from 16 = 3 inches.</li>
	<li>Shape from 30 to 7.</li>
	<li>Shape the top edge of the brassiere section from 29 to A, and then
reduce the difference between the side-seam at the back by a bust dart at 31
3 inches down from A, making the dart 3 inches in length.</li>
	<li>32 from 16 = 3 inches.</li>
	<li>33 from 6 = 6 inches.</li>
	<li>Shape the yoke seam from 32 to 33.</li>
	<li>34 from 25 = 3 inches.</li>
	<li>35 from 24 = the same distance as 33 from 6.</li>
	<li>Shape from 34 to 35.</li>
	<li>Square down from 14 to 36.</li>
	<li>37 from 36 = 1&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>38 from 36 = 1&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>Complete the shaping of the sideseams from 14 to 37 and 38.</li>
	</ul>
<p>When cutting from the material, the top bodice section from 27 to 1, 24
and 35 is cut in one with the hip yoke section from 24 to 25, 34 and 35, on
the fold of the material.</p>
<p>Cut the garment from the material on the bias as shown by Fig. 223.</p>
<h3><a name="cutbias" id="cutbias"></a><em><a href="illust/223.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,576);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/223-t.jpg" alt="Figure 223" width="185" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig223" id="fig223"></a>Cutting on the Bias (Fig. 223)</h3>
<p>Fig. 223 illustrates two methods of cutting the cami-knickers on the bias
of the material.</p>
<p>Fig. 223 (a) shows a layout taking 1&frac12; yards 16 inches of 36-inch width
silk with all sections of the garment cut the same way of the material or
pattern. The diagonal lines indicate the true bias of the grain, and the
various parts of the garments should be placed to run exactly in alignment
with the bias lines, otherwise twisting will occur in the making-up.</p>
<p>The front skirt or leg section should be marked out first with 1 inch
added down the inside leg seam for the leg fastening.</p>
<p>Allow seams all round the pattern before cutting out; &frac12; inch is the
usual seam allowance, which gives sufficient material for either French or
plain seams.</p>
<p>The brassiere section is taken out in the corner below the bottoms of the
legs as indicated, with &frac12; inch allowed for seams at each edge.</p>
<p>Further up the length, the back and fronts of the body part are marked
out. The fronts are indicated by the dash lines and are taken from the single
width either above or below the back part. Allow &frac12; inch seams round each
pattern edge, and then complete the layout by placing the back leg section
above the body part towards the end of the length.</p>
<p>Add 1 inch down the inside leg seam for the leg fastening, and add &frac12;
inch seams throughout.</p>
<p>Fig. 223 (b) illustrates another layout for bias cutting, in which the
front and back leg sections are cut in one piece without a sideseam. The same
amount of material, 1&frac12; yards, is used and, to commence, this length is folded
end to end so that the selvedges are level and we have a length &frac34; yard by
36 inches in width.</p>
<p>The parallel lines show the exact bias, and the layout is as follows.
Place the back and front body parts in the left corner of the length, and
mark out to their full width so that one section can be taken from the top
layer of material and the other section from the under layer.</p>
<p>Place the sideseams of the back and front leg sections together, and then
mark out on the length as indicated. Allow &frac12; inch seams at all seam edges
and 1 inch at each inside leg seam for the leg fastening.</p>

Nightgown or an Underslip (Fig. 224)</h3>
<p>The following draft illustrates a foundation for adapting to nightgown or
underslip cutting on the bias of the material. Based on the dress system, the
draft illustrates the reduction of waist suppression without manipulation.</p>
<p>Measures for the draft are as follows&#8212;</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>Bust = 36 inches.</li>
	<li>Waist = 28 inches.</li>
	<li>Hips = 39 inches.</li>
	<li>Natural waist length = 15 inches.</li>
	<li>Full length = 52 inches.</li>
	<li>Working scale = half the bust girth = 18 inches.</li>
	</ul>
<p>To draft&#8212;</p>
<p>Square from X.</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>1 from X = the back depth = one-third of the scale plus 1&frac12;
inches.</li>
	<li>2 from X = the natural waist length = 15 inches.</li>
	<li>3 from 2 = 8 inches down for the hip level.</li>
	<li>4 from X = the full length.</li>
	<li>Square out from the above points.</li>
	<li>5 from X = the back neck width = one-sixth of the scale less &frac14;
inch.</li>
	<li>6 from 5 = the height of the back neck curve = &frac34; inch.</li>
	<li>Shape from 6 to X.</li>
	<li>Square out from 3 to 7 half the hip measure net plus 1 inch.</li>
	<li>Square up from 7 to 8, 9 and 10 and down to 12 at the hem line.</li>
	<li>11 from 10 = one-twelfth of the scale.</li>
	<li>13 from 11 = one-sixth of the scale.</li>
	<li>14 is half of 7 to 3 for the position of the sideseam.</li>
	<li>Square up from 14 to 15 and 16 and down to 17.</li>
	<li>18 from X = the normal half-back width = 6&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>19 is &frac14; inch out from a point 1 inch down from 18.</li>
	<li>Join 13 to 19.</li>
	<li>20 from 13 = 19 to 6 less &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>21 from 20 = &frac12; inch. Shape the front shoulder seam from 21 to 13.</li>
	<li>Measure from 9 to 22 half the bust measure plus 1 inch.</li>
	<li>Reduce the surplus quantity shown at 1 to 22 from the sideseams at 16 to
23 and 24.</li>
	<li>25 from 24 = one-twelfth of the scale less &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>26 from 9 = one-fourth of the scale less 1&frac14; inches.</li>
	<li>27 is half of 9 to 26.</li>
	<li>Join 27 to 25.</li>
	<li>28 from 25 = &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>Square down from 24 to 29 and 23 to 30.</li>
	<li>Measure from 8 to 31 &frac14; inches less than 8 to 29.</li>
	<li>32 from 30 = 1&frac12; inches. Shape the sideseam from 23 to 32 and to 14
and 33, overlapping 4 inches from 17 to 33.</li>
	<li>34 from 17 = 4 inches.</li>
	<li>Shape the front sideseam from 31 to 14 and 34.</li>
	<li>Shape the bodice sideseam from 28 to 29.</li>
	<li>The difference shown from 29 to 31 is reduced by gathers under the bust
at the front waist seam.</li>
	<li>35 from 28 = one-sixth of the scale for the position of the bust
dart.</li>
	<li>Shape out the bust dart, as shown, 4 inches in length.</li>
	<li>36 from 13 = the length of the front opening = 9&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>Shape the waist seam from 36 to 31.</li>
	<li>The shoulder-strap section is located by finding the centre of the front
shoulder at 37, and then making the strap the required width equally each
side of this point to 38 and 39.</li>
	<li>Shape the front neck opening from 38 to 36 and the armhole from 39 to
&frac12; inch below 28 as shown.</li>
	<li>40 is half of 6 to 19.</li>
	<li>Make the back shoulder strap from 41 to 42 equal to the width from 38 to
39 at the front shoulder.</li>
	<li>43 from 2 = 3 inches for the depth of the back waist decollete.</li>
	<li>Shape from 41 to 43 and from 42 to 23 for the shape of the armhole at
the back.</li>
	</ul>
<p>This completes the foundation draft for either a nightgown or an
underslip.</p>
<p>When cutting from the material on the bias, it will be necessary to cut
the skirt section with a corner piece joined on, as it is impossible to take
the length out on the bias owing to the material used being only 36 inches
approximately in width. It is the usual practice to make this join at the
sideseam on one side only.</p>
<h3><em><a href="illust/225.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,480);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/225-t.jpg" alt="Figure 225" width="153" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig225" id="fig225"></a>Fig. 225</h3>
<p>The layout for bias-cutting illustrated by Fig. 225 is useful for the
general method of placing the pattern sections on the silk to the best
advantage. The layout takes 2&frac12; yards of 36-inch width silk, and the skirt
sections are cut without sideseam joins.</p>

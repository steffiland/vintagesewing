  <p>THERE are so many different ideas on the correct methods of making a
tailored costume jacket or long coat that it would be impossible to
generalize and not disagree with many people. In tailoring as in cutting,
there are the advocates of plenty of manipulation and working-up of the
garment to secure the required effect, while, in the wholesale trade, such
expensive work is cut right out of the production side, and garments are
produced in great numbers with a clean-finished appearance much to be
admired. Too often, owing to the constant pulling and manipulating it
receives, a well-cut garment seems to have lost a lot of its &quot;life&quot;
when finally finished. This is not to be wondered at, for there probably has
been a number of &quot;fiddling&quot; alterations and fittings with the
result that the garment bears no resemblance to the original cut when finally
sent to the client. The author believes that every garment should be cut as
perfectly as possible at the first cutting and made with the minimum of
delay, and then we have a really smart and clean-looking garment. It is the
speed of the wholesale trade in turning out the garments that retains their
original smartness of cut; there is none of the hanging-up on the hanger
until the client condescends to call for the frequent fitting, with the
consequent stretching of the shoulders and scye out of shape.</p>
  <p>The price question is another most important factor to be considered, for
no one but a philanthropist would put into a garment work that is not paid
for, and a lot of the laboured tailoring that tradition compels us to insert
into every garment before we can call it &quot;tailored&quot; can be
dispensed with and the fit and style considerably unproved. Women these days
are quick to note fashion changes and usually desire garments in the latest
cut, and why ladies' tailors should still persist in putting enough work into
a garment for a possible four or so years is on the face of it a mystery. A
costume these days shows a variation of style every six months to a year,
whether it is in the jacket or skirt length, size and shape of the lapels
or the hem width of the skirt, and we should make our garment to last as long
as the cut will remain modern and, in doing so, avoid some of the time-taking
tailoring.</p>
  <p>The question of canvas and padding is a sore point with many tailors. They
cannot visualize a lady's coat made up without padding or canvas through the
fronts, and if they get a young woman in the shop who wants a light-weight
coat for summer wear, they still insert the usual quota of &quot;French
canvas.&quot; Canvas can be eliminated in the majority of the more
&quot;dressy&quot; or &quot;town&quot; coats, and retained only in strictly
tailored garments with definitely stereotyped lapels and collars where it is
fundamentally necessary for the retention of shape.</p>
  <p>In this chapter on <a href="lgcm-19.html">practical tailoring</a> the author endeavours to illustrate
the accepted methods of tailoring he uses for garments and, in addition,
explains how to make a garment throughout by machine as in the wholesale
trade. The general procedure may be different from other ideas, but the
ultimate result and the practicability of the methods used are their own
recommendation.</p>
<p>Previously, the author has described the allowances for inlays and cutting
from the material, and we can go straight on with the making. For an example
of tailoring methods, the double-breasted costume jacket, with a panel back and plain
fronts with shoulder and waist darts, has been chosen. Two cross jeatted
hip pockets are indicated with a welt breast pocket. The edges are plain, and
the coat is lined throughout.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a name="linings" id="linings"></a><em><a href="illust/280.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,376);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/280-t.jpg" alt="Figure 280" width="131" height="218" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig280" id="fig280"></a>Cutting the Linings (Fig. 280)</h3>
<p>It is always better to cut the coat linings at the same time as the actual
garment to save unnecessary ripping out after the fitting. If the coat fits
perfectly without any alterations, it is a waste of time to rip the seams in
order to cut the linings; therefore, the author always cuts linings and
canvas from the garment and makes any alterations when re-marking the
coat.</p>
<p>When cutting the linings it must be remembered that the outer cloth will
stretch, while the linings will not; so it is advisable to cut the linings to
fit slightly easier. Whether or not the garment is to be made throughout by
machine will also affect the cut of the linings, but for the present
description we will work on better-class methods of making.</p>
<p>To cut the linings, refer to Fig. 280, which shows the back, side panel,
and sleeves with inlay allowances as described in the section on the
Provision for Inlays.</p>
<p>Fig. 280 (a) shows the back panel, and the lining for the latter is cut
exactly to the same length at the neck and the bottom edge with the identical
&frac12; inch inlay allowed at the back neck curve. From the back neck point add
about &frac14; inch to the panel seam on the shoulders, as shown by the shaded
lines, and continue the addition down the panel seam to the waist level; from
this point the linings follow the run of the outside cloth.</p>
<p>It is advisable to cut the linings to the inlay length of the back in case
the jacket length requires any adjustment. In a machined coat this cannot be
done, for the linings are machined in with the inlay at the bottom edge and
must be cut to the exact length plus seam allowances. Mark the back neck
inlay by tracing through from the jacket back and notch the waist balance
marks.</p>
<p>Fig. 280 (b) shows the side panel, and from this the linings are cut
identical with the run of the panel back seam and with the same inlay
allowance and to the length of the panel at the bottom edge. Across the
shoulder seam, add &frac14; inch to the length to agree with the addition made on
the back panel lining, and gradually increase this quantity to &frac12; inch at
the shoulder end. Allow &frac12; inch round the back scye as indicated by the
shaded lines and about &frac14; inch down the sideseams from the scye to the
bottom edge.</p>
<p>Trace the panel inlay through on to the lining from the outer panel and
notch the waist-line balance marks.</p>
<p>Fig. 280 (c) shows the top-sleeve with a lowered hindarm seam and a false
forearm at the front. When the sleeve linings are being cut, the addition of
&frac34; inch made on the forearm is disregarded owing to the non-elastic nature
of the lining material, for a certain amount of stretching is necessary at
the forearm seam with this cut to make the seams lie flat when they are sewn
together. It is impossible to stretch linings to the same extent as the
cloth, so that the top-sleeve lining is cut to take the shape of a plain
equal-width sleeve. This is shown on the draft by the dash lines down the
forearm. Cut the lining to the turn-up length at the cuff and &frac34; inch longer
than the sleeve length at the sleeve head, and add about 3/8 inch at each
seam to the total width across the sleeve head of the linings as shown by the
dash lines and shading.</p>
<p>Fig. 280 (d) illustrates the cutting of the under-sleeve lining. On the
draft &frac34; inch is added to the width of the sleeve lining all down the sleeve
to make up for the reduction from the top-sleeve width as described
previously. Add &frac34; inch to the full lining length as marked and spring out
the sideseams of the lining 3/8 inch each side of the sleeve head. The lining
is cut to the inlay length at the cuff edge.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a name="forepart" id="forepart"></a><em><a href="illust/281.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,297);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/281-t.jpg" alt="Figure 281" width="102" height="220" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig281" id="fig281"></a>The Cutting of the Forepart Lining
and the Facing (Fig. 281)</h3>
<p>Fig. 281 illustrates the forepart with the usual inlays added throughout.
The facing must be very carefully cut to the shape of the neck gorge from the
front neck point to the crease line, and then it is sprung out a bare &frac14;
inch to the peak commencement. Round the peak of the lapel, add about &frac12;
inch as shown for working on to the lapel point in making, continue this
&frac12;-inch allowance all down the lapel to the first button position and finish
of the lapel shape. From the end of the lapel to the bottom edge, mark the
facing identically in shape with that of the garment, and then make the width
about 5 inches at the bottom edge, increasing to the shoulder to finish at
the front seam of the dart, and add the same inlay to the facing as that
added to the forepart. The lining is cut to the full length of the garment at
the bottom edge, and then from the shoulder seam it is marked to commence at
two seams in advance of the back dart seam to allow for seams in making, as
no seams are allowed on the shoulder dart of the coat. At the termination of
the shoulder dart of the coat, overlap the lining over the facing by &frac12; inch
for two seams, as indicated by the shaded and dash lines.</p>
<p>At the sideseam, cut the lining equal to the outside from the bottom edge
to the waist, and then add about 3/8 inch of extra width over the breast
line.</p>
<p>Round the scye, add &frac12; inch of extra width to agree with the addition
made to the back lining at this part, and then mark the shoulders with 3/8
inch increased length as indicated by the shaded lines and dash inlay mark
from the shoulder dart to the shoulder end. This addition to the back and
front linings is for ease and to allow for a small shoulder pad.</p>
<p>Mark the inlays by tracing through from the outside and mark the waist
dart.</p>
<p>Very often the linings may be cut without the shoulder dart being taken
out, and the surplus is pleated over to provide for more ease over the bust
prominence.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a name="marking" id="marking"></a><em><a href="illust/282.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,591);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/282-t.jpg" alt="Figure 282" width="190" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig282" id="fig282"></a>Marking Up (Fig. 282)</h3>
<p>After cutting out the linings, the next operation is to tack-mark all the
inlays. This is done in the usual manner with double basting cotton, and, by
taking wide tacking stitches, mark up all the inlays and then cut through
each tack loop. Next, by separating the material just sufficiently to enable
the loops to be snipped through between the two cloth layers so as to make a
tacking mark on each layer, complete the marking-up process. The shoulder
dart may be either sewn out in the marks or cut down one side and then sewn
out as an inlay. In the latter event, cut a &frac14;-inch seam inside the chalk
marks at the front mark, and then mark up the back dart seam &frac14; inch inside
the chalk mark as indicated. When the dart is sewn out the edge of the front
seam goes to the marking thread and is sewn a seam inside to agree with the
original shoulder dart marking.</p>
<p>Mark up the pocket ends by crossing marking threads and the centre line by
a few marks to give a balance when the garment is fitted.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a name="canvas" id="canvas"></a><em><a href="illust/283.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,339);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/283-t.jpg" alt="Figure 283" width="106" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig283" id="fig283"></a>The Canvas (Fig. 283)</h3>
<p>All strictly tailored jackets and long coats should have an interlining of
canvas through the fronts to give a firm foundation and retain the shape of
the shoulders and lapels. The canvas should be cut to the shape of the
shoulders and shoulder dart, and roughly to the shape of the lapels, so that
they may be trimmed up when they are tacked to the coat. A seam should be run
from the termination of the bust dart to the side edge of the canvas at the
waist, and about &frac12; inch taken out to provide for waist and breast shape in
the canvas foundation.</p>
<p>The section of the canvas which forms the scye interlining should be cut
on the bias of the material, to allow for stretching at the front of the
armhole over the prominence of the shoulder bone.</p>
<p>Cut the canvas wide enough at the pocket level to allow for the
pocket-mouth tack, and then taper back towards the fronts at the hem.</p>
<p>A seam should be allowed each side of the shoulder dart when cutting from
the canvas, and the two sections overlapped and stitched through instead of
seamed out.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a name="pockets" id="pockets"></a><em><a href="illust/284.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,127);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/284-t.jpg" alt="Figure 284" width="43" height="240" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig284" id="fig284"></a>Inserting the Pockets (Fig. 284)</h3>
<p>Having marked up the garment completely, we can now commence to insert the
pockets. For the style chosen, the necessary pockets are two jeatted side
pockets and one welt breast pocket to allow for a variation of procedure.</p>
<p>The jeatted pockets each has a facing at the top and bottom and a backing
of the same material to cover the pocketing. Each facing should be cut at
least &frac34; inch longer at each side than the pocket opening length and 1&frac14;
inches in width as indicated by Figs. 284 (a) and (b). These pieces are cut
on the double to make four single facings in all. The facing which forms the
backing to the pocketing is cut approximately twice as wide as the top and
bottom facings, as indicated by Fig. 284 (c), since it has to equal the
height of the top facing above the pocket opening and the depth of the bottom
facing below the pocket mouth.</p>
<p>The pocket is usually made of silesia pocketing and is cut to the required
length or depth less the width of the pocket facing; in any case, it is usual
to trim up the depth before machining round.</p>
<p>To machine the facings of the pocket mouth to the pocket, take the bottom
facings, separate the two sections and, by laying the right side of the
facing to the right side of the pocketing, machine across as shown by Fig.
284 (e). The bottom edge of the facing goes to the top edge of the pocketing;
it is important to remember this point when the pockets are curved or placed
on the slant.</p>
<p>After machining the facing to the pocketing, press over the seams to
overlap the pocket over the facing for a thin edge, and then edge-stitch
through as indicated on Fig. 284 (f).</p>
<p>Make up the other front pocket section as described and then make the
pocket backing section.</p>
<p>Take the back facings, separate the two sections, then lay the right side
of the facing to the right side of the pocketing and machine across the top
edge as indicated in Fig. 284 (g).</p>
<p>Press the seams of the pocket and facing downwards and then machine
overlap the pocketing over the facing by edge-stitching as in Fig. 284
(h).</p>
<p>This completes the preliminary work for inserting the pockets, and now we
commence work on the coat.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><a href="illust/285.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,284);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/285-t.jpg" alt="Figure 285" width="106" height="240" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig285" id="fig285"></a>Fig. 285</h3>
<p>The waist dart should be seamed out before the pockets are inserted. After
this has been done, on the wrong side of the material, baste a 1&frac14;-inch
strip of linen across the coat from the centre front to the sideseam to cover
the pocket mouth equally and form a stay for the pocket jeattings. This is
shown by Fig. 285 (a), and the waist dart is indicated cut through so as to
be pressed out flat.</p>
<p>On the right side of the fronts, mark the pocket mouth by a plain chalk
line, and then tack the bottom facing and pocket with the edge of the facing
to the pocket opening line and the right side of the pocket and facing to the
right side of the fronts. Baste securely in position, overlapping each end of
the pocket mouth by a quantity of &frac34; inch to allow for machining round the
edges of the pocket.</p>
<p>The top facing is then basted to meet the edge of the bottom facing and
pocket mouth line, with the right side of the facing against the right side
of the fronts. Mark the termination of the pocket opening clearly in chalk as
a guide for machining, and then machine along the top and bottom of the
pocket mouth opening on the facings a distance of &frac14; inch or a narrow seam
inside the line. Do not machine across the ends of the facings, but finish
off each line of machining securely as in Fig. 285 (b).</p>
<p>After machining the facings to the fronts, cut through the pocket opening
to within &frac12; inch of the ends of the opening, and then cut diagonally across
the facings to the machine stitches as indicated, leaving a &quot;lip&quot;
at each end of the pocket mouth.</p>
<p>After cutting across the pocket-mouth opening, turn the forepart over to
the inside, and then press open the seams where the facings are sewn to the
coat. When the seams at the top and bottom of the pocket opening have been
pressed open, pull the top facing through the opening and turn back inside to
the width of the jeatting required, which is equal to the width of the seam
of the facing after being pressed open.</p>
<p>Before basting down the top facing inside, turn back the two
&quot;lips&quot; at each end of the pocket and tack securely down on the
inside so as to make a clean termination to the jeattings on the pocket
opening.</p>
<p>Baste down the top facing from one end of the pocket opening to the other,
making sure that the width of the jeatting is equal all the way along on the
outside. Do not baste past the ends of the opening as the pocket must be sewn
close to these points.</p>
<p>At the bottom edge of the pocket opening, press open the seam of the
facing to the coat and then pull the facing and pocket through to the inside
of the coat. Fold the facing and pocket back until the outside jeatting is
the same in width as the top jeatting, and then baste along the facing to
keep it securely in position, taking care not to tack past the ends of the
pocket opening. After the top and bottom facings are basted down, the pocket
opening on the outside should be completely filled by the jeatting edges, and
the width of the jeattings should be equal to the width of the seams taken
out when the facings are sewn to the coat.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><a href="illust/286.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,292);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/286-t.jpg" alt="Figure 286" width="100" height="220" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig286" id="fig286"></a>Fig. 286</h3>
<p>After basting down the bottom facing, the next operation is to
machine-tack the facing through from the outside. This is done by machining
exactly in the seam line of the jeatting so as to hide the machine stitching,
from one end of the pocket opening to the other as indicated by the
machine-stitching marks in Fig. 286 (a).</p>
<p>The pocket should be trimmed to the correct length to within &frac12; inch of
the bottom edge line, and then the pocket can be finished.</p>
<p>The backing facing and pocket section are then basted down to cover the
top and bottom facings as shown in Fig. 286 (b), and the pocket length
trimmed to agree with the length of the under-pocket section.</p>
<p>To complete the inside work on the jeatted pocket, rip out the tacking
threads which hold the two corner &quot;lips&quot; in position, and then
machine all round the pocket from one side of the facings to the other,
catching in the corner &quot;lips.&quot; Stitch as close as possible to the
end of the pocket mouth and trim all surplus pocketing away after
machining.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><a href="illust/287.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,347);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/287-t.jpg" alt="Figure 287" width="109" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig287" id="fig287"></a>Fig. 287.</h3>
<p>Before the pocket can be machine-tacked across the top jeatting to hold
the back and front facings together, it is necessary to have the canvas
tacked in the forepart so that the machine-tack has a &quot;stay.&quot;</p>
<p>To tack in the canvas, lay the canvas flat on the board, then place the
forepart over the canvas and work back from the front edge to the sideseam.
Baste down from the shoulder at the front neck point to the first button
position, following the crease line of the lapels, and then continue tacking
the outside to the canvas from this point to the bottom edge and across the
bottom to the side of the canvas, making sure that the canvas is not short in
length from the shoulder seam to the bottom edge. After this operation, baste
down the shoulder dart to the waist, following the shape of the forepart by
basting over the hand or a shaped board, and then continue from the seam of
the canvas at the waist down to the bottom edge to meet the tacking thread
from the fronts. Complete the tacking of the canvas by basting from the waist
seam to the front of the armhole and round the scye to the shoulder seam as
in Fig. 287.</p>
<p>When the canvas has been inserted, turn the forepart over to the right
side and then machine-tack the top facing of the pocket down on the canvas
and to a linen stay from the back end of the pocket opening to the sideseam
as indicated in Fig. 287 by the stitching marks. The stitching should be done
very carefully between the jeatting and the forepart in the jeatting seam to
be hidden from view.</p>
<p> At each end of the pocket opening, make a &quot;V&quot; tack by invisible
stitching to appear as shown in Fig. 287. The inside top and backing facings
may be &quot;serged&quot; together after being trimmed down as much as
possible for thinness.</p>

<p> Fig. 288 illustrates how the jeatted pocket appears when finished, with
narrow jeattings and &quot;V&quot; tacks at each end of the opening. To make
a smart finish to the pocket and also one which women invariably prefer,
place a &quot;sprat's head&quot; at each corner of the pocket opening. Full
directions on how to make this decorative stitching will be found in Chapter
XXI. Fig. 288 also indicates the line of the breast dart from the hip point
diagonally to the bust prominence, which gives extra length at the sideseam
in the waist to enable the garment to follow round the natural curves of the
figure without distortion or fullness at the wrong places.</p>
<p> The other side of the coat has a jeatted pocket inserted in the same
manner.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a name="welt" id="welt"></a><em><a href="illust/289.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,263);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/289-t.jpg" alt="Figure 289" width="97" height="240" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig289" id="fig289"></a>Welt Pockets</h3> 
<p>After the bottom pockets have been inserted, we turn our attention to the
top breast pocket. This is invariably placed on the left side of the garment
for women's as for gentlemen's garments and made about 3&frac12; to 4 inches
in
length. This pocket is simply for show purposes so that it need not be too
extreme in length or width of the welt.</p>
<p>The top breast pocket is inserted before the canvas has been tacked into
the fronts, so that we must retrace our steps for this purpose. The first
operation is the machining out of the shoulder dart. Indicated in Fig. 289
(a), we have the inside of the left forepart with the welt pocket marked and
the shoulder dart cut through down the front and tack-marked at the back.
Fold the shoulder over as indicated by Fig. 289 (b), place the front seam of
the shoulder dart to the tack marks, and then machine down the shoulder dart
from the shoulder seam to taper away gradually on the breast.</p>
<p>Carefully press open the shoulder dart, then turn the forepart over to the
outside and mark the pocket to the required length and position, as in Fig.
290 (a).</p>
<p class="clear"><em><a href="illust/290.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,255);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/290-t.jpg" alt="Figure 290" width="94" height="240" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig290" id="fig290"></a>For a welt pocket it is necessary to cut a welt and a backing facing for
the inside to prevent the pocketing showing. Each of these facings should be
cut on the right side of the material to match the coat and at the correct
slanting angle.</p>
<p>Fig. 290 (b) illustrates the welt. This is cut to the length of the pocket
opening plus about &frac12; inch to &frac34; inch at each end for making purposes, and
about 1 inch wider than the required welt width. The backing facing is cut in
the same manner as the welt part and to the same width and length.</p>
<p>Fig. 290 (d) shows the pocket front which sews to the welt. As shown on
the draft, the wrong side of the material is illustrated to allow the right
side of the material to be inside the pocket in wear. Cut the pocket to the
width of the welt and about 5 inches in length. The back of the pocket is cut
about 1 inch shorter as shown by the dash lines in Fig. 290 (d), with the
right side of the material to the right side of the front part.</p>
<h3><a name="insertwelt" id="insertwelt"></a>Inserting the Welt Pocket</h3>
<p>Commence by sewing the backing facing to the pocket back as illustrated by
Fig. 290 (e) with the right side of the facing to the right side of the
pocketing, making sure that when the facing is pressed back the sides of the
facing and pocket are a continuous run. Press the facing and pocketing seam
downwards, and then edge-stitch the two sections through as indicated in Fig.
290 (f).</p>
<p>The right side of the welt is then sewn to the right side of the pocketing
as illustrated by Fig. 290 (g), so that when the welt is in position on the
coat and the top edge turns back with the pocketing, the pocket will be in
alignment vertically with the welt. Machine-stitch across the edge of the two
sections, then press the seams downwards over the pocket, and edge-stitch
through the welt and pocketing as indicated in Fig. 290 (h).</p>
<p>A 1&frac14;-inch strip of linen should be tacked across the pocket mouth under
the fronts from the scye for a pocket stay, and then we can proceed with the
next step in the insertion of the welt pocket.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><a href="illust/291.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,250);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/291-t.jpg" alt="Figure 291" width="92" height="240" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig291" id="fig291"></a>Fig. 291</h3>
<p>Fig. 291 (a) illustrates the next process in the making. The backing
facing is tacked to the line of the welt as indicated, with the right side of
the pocketing and facing to the right side of the material, about &frac34; inch
being allowed at each end of the pocket opening. The right side of the welt
and front pocketing is then tacked against the line of the pocket as
indicated with the wrong side of the welt, etc., uppermost. Mark the pocket
ends clearly with chalk and then baste a thin strip of linen across the welt
to the width of the welt required when finished.</p>
<p> Machine through welt and facing to each end of the pocket opening as
shown by the stitch marks, then cut through the pocket line to within &frac12;
inch of each end, and &quot;V&quot; notch the forepart and the backing facing
to the stitching lines as indicated. Do not &quot;V&quot; notch the welt as
this makes it difficult for turning in the ends and tacking.</p>
<p>When this has been completed, turn to the inside of the forepart, press
open the backing facing and forepart seam, and pull the pocket through from
the outside to the inside of the fronts. This is illustrated by Fig. 291
(b).</p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><a href="illust/292.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,251);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/292-t.jpg" alt="Figure 292" width="93" height="240" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig292" id="fig292"></a>Fig. 292</h3>
<p>The welt should then be marked to the width required as in Fig. 292 (a)
and the seam of the welt and fronts pressed open to allow for the welt to be
turned back and upwards on the fronts. When the welt has been turned back,
fold in the width line and then pull the pocket through from the outside to
the inside. It will be found necessary to trim the width of the pocketing to
pass the width of the opening in a &quot;V&quot; wedge as illustrated by Fig.
292 (b), which shows the front part of the pocket underneath the backing
section.</p>
<p>Carefully tack the front and back of the pocket together, making sure that
there are no drags from any point, then machine round the pocket from the
side of the opening round the bottom edge to the other side, and trim away
any surplus pocketing. This completes the work on the inside of the forepart,
and the canvas should be tacked to the fronts. In practice, all the inside
work on the pockets is completed before the canvases are tacked in, and then
the outside work of tacking the pockets is completed.</p>
<p>In dealing with pockets, each must be described in detail, and it is
necessary to give a complete description of one kind of pocket before
proceeding with another type.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><em><a href="illust/293.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,272);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/293-t.jpg" alt="Figure 293" width="101" height="240" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig293" id="fig293"></a>Fig.
293</h3>
<p>To continue with the description of the welt pocket, trim the length at
  each end of the pocket opening to within &frac12; inch of the end, and then
carefully cut away at the inside of the welt any superfluous material in the
shape of linen or pocketing so as to make a thin welt finish as in Fig. 293
(a).  </p>
<p>Mark the exact length of the welt, and then turn in each end and inside
    tack to the fronts by hand or by machine. This is done by back-stitching or
    machine-stitching the turned-in end of the welt from the inside of the pocket
    opening through the fronts and canvas as near to the end of the welt as
    possible. Cut away the surplus length of the welt after tacking each end, and
    then baste down the welt and hand-tack outside at each end as illustrated by
Fig. 293 (b).</p>
<p>Welts are perhaps the most difficult of all pockets to make, as a lot of
      care must be taken in accurately marking in the width, turning in each end
      and tacking inside. All surplus material inside the end of the welt should be
      cut away before the turning-in, and it is advisable to back-stitch the ends
of the welt neatly for firmness and ease in making.</p>

  Seams (Fig. 294)</h3>
<p>After making the pockets and tacking the canvases to the fronts, the next
        operation is making the back part. The inlay on the side back panel should
  be marked up. The right side of the centre back panel is laid against the right
        side of the material of the side panel with the seam edge of the back
  panel
        against the inlay tacking threads of the side panel. It is then basted
  down from the shoulder seam to the bottom edge, care being taken to keep the
  waist
        and hip balance notches level and in alignment. The draft shows only
  one half of the back panel; the other side is treated in the same manner. Machine
  down
        the panel seam as indicated, and then either press open the seam as for
  a plain seam or press the two seams, inlay seam and single seam, towards the
        centre back to enable the outside stitching to lap the back over the
  side
        panel. For tailored costume jackets, the usual procedure is to edge-stitch
        the seams if they are not to be made plain; usually, only for sportswear
jackets are the seams stitched wider than on the edge.</p>
<p>The shape of the back part after the panel seam has been pressed open
          illustrates the increased length created at the sideseam by the suppression
at the side back waist.</p>
<p>The back and fronts are now ready for the linings, and the making of these
is the next operation in the procedure.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a name="makelining" id="makelining"></a><em><a href="illust/295.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,541);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/295-t.jpg" alt="Figure 295" width="174" height="192" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig295" id="fig295"></a>Making the Linings for Back and
  Foreparts (Fig. 295)</h3>
<p>All inlays on the linings should either be marked up with basting threads
    or traced through with a tracing wheel before machining is commenced. The
    waist dart or any darts are first sewn out in the marks and not cut through
    as in the coat, and then the right side of the facing is tacked to the right
    side of the lining and machined down from the shoulder to the bottom edge and
    vice versa for the left facing. The lining should always be underneath during
    machining to prevent the facing from creeping up under the machine and
    causing a tight lining when finished. Unless the machinist is very
    experienced, it is advisable always to pin or tack linings, for the sheen on
    the face of the linings always tends to slip on the smooth surface of
cloth.</p>
<p>While on the subject of tacking, it is difficult to understand why tailors
      do not take a leaf out of dressmakers' books and use more pins in their work.
      It indicates a stubborn attitude to look upon pins as suitable only for the
      dressmaker's use. It is a frequent occurrence to see a young worker, who has
      been taught by strict tailoring methods, try to insert a sleeve into a coat
      with correct balance and distribution of fullness round the scye. Very often
      the sleeve has to come out one or two times as perhaps the fullness may be
      too high, at other times too low; more often than not, one sleeve is pitched
      from &frac12; inch to &frac34; inch more or less than the other, and neither is
      correct. Too well have we heard the instructions to &quot; ease the fullness
      gradually into the scye over the shoulder bone,&quot; and our shoulder bones
      are anywhere from down at the bottom of the armhole to round opposite the
      blades, judging from where the fullness is basted! A few pins materially
      assist the putting in of a sleeve as all good dressmakers know. If we watch a
      dressmaker put a sleeve into a dress or coat we see that the sleeve is pinned
      into the correct hang and balance while the coat is on the stand before it is
      tacked in finally, the possibility of a badly balanced sleeve with misplaced
      sleeve head fullness thus being avoided. Contrast the usual method of the
      tailor-taught worker. He or she marks the front pitch if it has not already
      been marked by the cutter, tacks the front seam of the sleeve to the front
      pitch and the back seam of the sleeve to the back pitch, and then works round
      the sleeve from the front seam round the front of the scye to the back pitch,
      easing in the fullness of the sleeve by judgment. If there is too much
      fullness when the proximity of the back pitch is reached, the sleeve is taken
      out and the operation started again, and maybe the back pitch is lowered to
      allow for more top-scye circumference. Finally the sleeve is basted in, and
      then, and not before, does the worker inspect the hang of the sleeve. It may
      be correct or it may not, but the point is that the balance of a sleeve
      should not be found by trial and error methods, but should be determined
before the tacking stage.</p>
<p>This brings us back to the reason for this digression, the use of pins as
        an aid to good work, a point which cannot be overstressed. Tacking threads
        are very well in their way, but pins can simplify the work of basting seams,
        for all materials work up over the ringers when they are being tacked if care
        is not exercised, and a few pins down a seam before the tacking is commenced
prevent this danger.</p>
<p>The back linings are machined up with the edge of the back panel lining
          against the traced inlay mark of the side panel section and then pressed
          open. When machining see that the two linings are tacked together perfectly
          flat to prevent any distortion of the seams when the linings are in the
coat.</p>

Joining Together (Fig. 296)</h3>
<p>Fig. 296 illustrates a view of the back and foreparts from the inside
            after the canvas has been inserted and the pockets tacked down. The back part
            shows the panel seam pressed open and the creation of side-seam length by
            back waist suppression. Before the back is joined to the foreparts, the
            latter may be lined and also the back linings tacked in. For a coat of this
            type of making, the sideseam and shoulder seams of the lining are usually
            felled instead of machined, to ensure a good-fitting lining and to allow for
            the front facing to be caught down to the canvas in order to prevent any
            rolling back of the edges, a fault common to tailored coats with sewn-on
facings.</p>
<p>The next operation is the padding of the lapels and the sewing of a linen
              stay-tape down the crease line of the lapels and down the front edge to give
it a thin finish.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a name="pad" id="pad"></a><em><a href="illust/297.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,387);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/297-t.jpg" alt="Figure 297" width="122" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig297" id="fig297"></a>Padding the Lapels, etc. (Fig. 297)</h3>
<p>The linen bridle down the crease line of the lapels is the first thing to
                tackle. Mark the crease line of the lapel on the canvas, and
  then cut a strip of linen about 1&frac14; inches in width and approximately
  2 inches longer than the crease line so that it can be carried up on to the
  collar. Commence to
                tack the linen down the crease line of the lapel from the gorge
  to the fronts, and slightly draw in the fronts under the linen from the gorge
  to
                about half-way down the crease line, as in Fig. 297 (a). Do not
  draw in more than about 3/8 inch in all, as the neck point is sufficiently
  straight and
                enough contour shape is infused into the garment over the breast
  without unnecessary manipulation. The front edge linen is shown in Fig. 297
  (b)
                before the stay down the crease line. In practice the lapels
  are pad-stitched to obtain the desired quantity of fullness in the canvas,
  and then the edge
                of the canvas is pared back about &frac34; inch and the linen
                added to the edge for thinness. To continue, cut away about &frac12; inch
                from the canvas at the edge of the lapels and about &frac34; inch
                down the fronts below the termination of the lapels, and then
                commence to pad-stitch the lapels.</p>
<p>Commencing about &frac12; inch below the gorge run, insert the needle, just
                  catch up the material and canvas, and make a series of such stitches down the
                  linen stay, each stitch being about &frac34; inch to 1 inch apart, and not on any
                  account being taken untidily through the cloth to show on the outside. Do not
                  pad-stitch to the end of the crease-line linen stay until the edge stay is in
                  position. When the finish of the crease-line stay in a downward direction is
                  reached, work back up the stay to the gorge, taking the stitches closely to
                  the first row. Continue pad-stitching up and down the lapel until the whole
                  lapel is covered, and then tack the edge stay in position as indicated in
                  Fig. 297 (c) and (d) showing the lapel edge stay continued down the front
edge.</p>
<p>Above the top button position, pad-stitch the linen stay to the lapel and,
                  from the button position downwards to the bottom edge, serge the linen to the
                  canvas without taking the stitches through the material, and also catch the
                  edge of the linen to the material at the extreme front edge. Continue the
                  front edge stay linen across the bottom edge from the fronts for a distance
of about 4 inches, the canvas having been first cut away underneath.</p>
<p>When pad-stitching the lapels, hold the coat with the hand curling the
                  lapels back so that some length of canvas is worked in with the pad-stitching
to retain the &quot;curl&quot; of the lapels in wear.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a name="facing" id="facing"></a><em><a href="illust/298.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,342);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/298-t.jpg" alt="Figure 298" width="107" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig298" id="fig298"></a>Putting on the Facing (Fig. 298)</h3>
<p>After the lapels have been pad-stitched, the facing may be basted to the
                    fronts and stitched round. As the methods of making described for this coat
                    are based upon the &quot;open coat&quot; principle, that is, with the
                    sideseams and the shoulders of the linings felled and not machined together,
                    the fronts and back can be lined independently of each other and finally
                    joined together afterwards. The coat facing has been cut with a suitable
                    quantity of extra width for working on the lapels, so that it will not be
                    necessary to estimate the required quantity of width for manipulation. It is
                    always advisable to cut the facing as accurately as possible so that
exactitude in working can be guaranteed.</p>
<p>To tack the facing to the fronts, commence to baste round the gorge from
                    the shoulder with the gorge seam of the lining in an exact
  position with the gorge run of the fronts. Then smooth the facing over the
  fronts, with the
                    right side of the facing to the right side of the fronts,
  until the front edge of the lining is level with the front edge of the coat.
  When this is
                    correctly placed, baste down the crease line of the lapels,
  leaving the excess width of the facing in front of the lapel edge. The most
  careful
                    basting is needed round the lapel points where length of
  the facing must be worked on to the lapel and also extra width. Baste up from
  the break of the
                    gorge run, easing in facing length with the basting, and
  then baste down the edge of the lapel with a similar quantity of facing length
  infused. The edge
                    of the facing should now be tacked level with the edge of
  the fronts, which will give a quantity of extra facing width between the creased-line
  tacking
                    thread and the edge of the lapels, this extra width being
  worked over the lapels in the outside basting. Roughly baste down the front
  panel seam and
                    down the side-seams from the armhole to keep the lining in
  position, then stitch round the facing and fronts from the point of the lapel
  to the bottom
                    edge as marked, commencing the stitching directly below the
  gorge break as indicated by the &quot;V&quot; notch, and at the bottom edge
  below the inlay taper back the stitching diagonally from this point to the
  edge.</p>

  <p>After machining round the edge of the coat, carefully pare away the edge
                      until the seam is about &frac12; inch wide, and then rip out all the old tacking
                      stitches. Turn the coat inside out, carefully turn out the lapel point by
                      means of a stiletto or thin-edged shears, and then baste all round the edge
                      of the coat, lapping the facing over the lapel to cover the seam. Below the
                      break, baste the facing about 1/8 inch back inside the coat fronts. After the
                      edge-basting, tack over the lapels from the edge to the crease line and work
                      on a sufficient amount of width to give a &quot;curl&quot; to the lapel. Also
                      make sure that the point of the lapel has sufficient material worked over so
  that the seams at each side are covered.</p>

  <p>To join the back to the fronts, place the edge of the back sideseam
                      against the inlay mark down the front sideseam, baste down from the scye to
                      the bottom edge level, and machine a &frac14; inch seam inside the edge of the
                      back. Press open the sideseams and then tack the forepart lining down to each
                      seam so that it lies flat towards the back. Turn in the back lining at the
  sideseams over the forepart lining and baste down for felling.</p>
  <p>At the bottom edge, baste up the inlay to the marks and secure to the coat
                      by catch-stitches, making sure that these are not taken through to the
                      outside. Baste the lining through to the outside about 2 inches above the
                      bottom edge, then pare away all surplus length, and turn up and tack down for
  felling.</p>
  <p>Join the back and foreparts at the shoulders by basting the edge of the
                      back shoulder seams to the inlay marks on the front shoulders, and machine
                      across, making sure to commence the machining at the gorge inlay mark and not
                      right through the shoulders to the end of the inlay. Press open the shoulder
  seam at each shoulder.</p>

  <p>The collar is made up separately before being sewn to the coat instead of
                      the usual method of sewing the under-collar to the neck and then covering
                      with the top-collar. The modern method is to cut the under-collar exactly to
                      the right length and shape as required. The top-collar is sewn to the
                      under-collar and basted out before the collar sees the actual coat neck. Very
                      accurate cutting is necessary for this method, but in practice the benefit is
  great and results in a much cleaner finish to the collar and lapels.</p>
  <p>Fig. 302 (a) shows the neck curve of the gorge after the shoulder seams
                      have been sewn together. Check up the length of the collar by measuring round
                      the neck curve a &frac14;-inch seam inside the inlay mark, and add &frac12; inch to
                      this measurement when measuring round the sewing edge of the collar as
  indicated in Fig. 302 (b).</p>
  <p>The top-collar is cut by the use of the under-collar outline, has &frac12; inch
                      added round the fall edge to the collar end, and is tapered back to &frac14; inch
  at the front sewing edge. This is illustrated by Fig. 302 (c).</p>
  <p>The canvas interlining is cut on the bias as shown by Fig. 302 (d), with a
                      seam down the centre back, and is laid so that the bias of the canvas runs
                      the same way on both sides. Cut the canvas slightly larger than the
  under-collar to allow for working-up.</p>
  <p>The crease line of the collar should be outlined with marking threads, and
                      then the centre seams of the under-collar and canvas are sewn together and
  the canvas tacked to the under-collar.</p>
  <p>The stand of the collar is machine-stitched to about &frac12; inch from the
                      sewing edge of the under-collar, and about four lines of stitching are
                      indicated. The canvas is then cut back about &frac14; inch from the edge of the
  under-collar.</p>
  <p>Pad-stitch the fall of the under-collar from the crease line to within &frac12;
    inch of the fall edge, as indicated by Fig. 302 (e), and, when this is done,
                      cut the canvas back about &frac14; inch from the fall edge so that it is not
  caught in with the collar seaming round the edge.</p>
  <p>In pad-stitching the under-collar, work the canvas over the collar to
                      obtain a &quot;curl&quot; to the fall, and well pad the ends of the fall
  especially.</p>
  <p>When the collar has been padded all over, fold at the crease line and
                      slightly shrink into a hollow shape as illustrated by Fig. 302 (f). Do not
                      stretch the fall or stand edges intentionally, for it is more necessary to
                      shrink the crease of the collar close to the neck than to stretch the fall
                      edge to lie flat over the shoulders. One operation performs the other, but
                      the correct method is to cut the collar to the correct length and then shrink
  in the crease.</p>
  <p>Similarly, fold the top-collar in half as with the under-collar, and
                      shrink by an amount equal to that by which the under-collar is shrunk. With
                      the top-collar, it is advisable to stretch the fall edges slightly over the
                      shoulder seam positions, as it is cut on the straight of the material and has
  not the &quot;give&quot; of the under-collar (see Fig. 302 (g)).</p>
  <p>Baste the top-collar to the under-collar as illustrated by Fig. 302 (h),
                      and ease in a slight amount of length at the collar end and round the fall
                      edge as indicated. When the collars are basted together, machine round the
                      fall edge from about &frac12; inch up from the sewing edge of the collar end at
                      each side. Pull out all the tacking threads and baste out the collar. Baste
                      round the edge, rolling the edge between the fingers for thinness, and then
                      baste over the collar to the crease edge, making sure to work in plenty of
                      extra material at the collar ends. The collar is now ready for sewing to the
  coat neck.</p>
  <p>Commence by basting the centre back seam of the collar to the centre back
                      seam of the coat. Baste the stand of the collar a seam inside or below the
                      inlay marking threads round the back neck, and then pin the collar end to the
                      end of the gorge at the peak of the lapel, with the stand overlapping the
                      notched seam left round the gorge about &frac14; inch to 3/8 inch. Baste the stand
                      to the gorge &frac14; inch below the inlay mark from the centre back to the collar
                      after the length has been verified by tacking the two collar ends in
                      position. A slight amount of ease in the collar is allowed over the shoulder
                      seam point; otherwise, the shoulders may crease owing to the collar dragging
                      the gorge back from the front as the fall edge requires length to cover the
                      shoulder. After basting round the collar stand it is then advisable to fell
                      round the stand edge before continuing with the top-collar, hand drawing so
                      that a firm foundation is made for this operation. Fell the stand edge with
                      neat stitches and, when this is completed, turn to the top-collar and
                      pad-stitch the crease-line linen stay to the under-collar canvas in a
  continuation of the crease line.</p>
  <p>Then turn the gorge edge back on the facing to the required amount and
                      serge down on to the shoulder canvas from the point of the lapel to the
                      shoulder seam. This must be done very carefully so as to obtain a straight
                      seam to the collar when finished. Perform this operation on both sides of the
                      gorge, and make sure to catch-stitch the canvas round the seam of the gorge
                      at each side and also across the shoulders to the seams of the back and
  foreparts.</p>
  <p>The sewing edge of the top-collar is now basted down against the gorge
                      edge of the shoulder and lapel, and turned in by the correct amount to allow
                      for a slight shortness between the collar seam and the gorge seam for the
  drawing operation.</p>
  <p>With invisible stitches carefully draw the two edges of the collar and
                      gorge seam together from the peak of the lapel to the shoulder seam at each
                      side. Across the back neck from shoulder seam to shoulder seam, fell the
  top-collar stand neatly down over the back neck inlay.</p>
  <p>The back lining may now be turned in and felled across the back neck above
                      the collar stand, and, across the shoulders to the shoulder ends, the back
                      lining is overlapped over the forepart linings and felled down. If shoulder
                      pads are inserted on the shoulders, the lining must be adjusted and felled
                      down after these have been inserted. After drawing the edges of the collar
                      and gorge seams together, side-stitch invisibly across the stand of the
                      top-collar to the under-collar and canvas to prevent the crease edge of the
                      collar from shifting, and this completes the making and putting on of the
  collar.</p>
  <p>The secret of this collar is accurate measurement of the coat gorge before
                      cutting the collar to length; otherwise the whole of the collar making is
                      much simpler and more accurate than the usual method of felling the
                      under-collar to the coat first and then basting and turning out the
                      top-collar. Now the collar is completed, the sleeves are the remaining job
  before the coat is ready for felling out and buttonholing.</p>

  303)</h3>
  <p>The sleeves are to have an opening at the hindarm and they are cut with an
  extension on the bottom inlay as illustrated in Fig. 303 (a) and (b).</p>
  <p>To make the sleeves, first mark up all the inlays and then trace through
  the lining inlay at the under-sleeve hindarm seam from the outside.</p>
  <p>Sew the forearm seam of the sleeve together first and then press open as
                      in Fig. 303 (c). With a three-quarter sleeve the forearm seam should be well
                      stretched in the hollow at the elbow before it is sewn to the under-sleeve;
                      otherwise the under-sleeve seam will be longer than the forearm seam, and the
                      sleeve will not lie flat when creased to the original forearm line, which is
  the natural creasing line of the sleeve.</p>
  <p>Baste the cuff turn-up to the required sleeve length with the right side
                      of the cuff inlay to the right side of the sleeve. Mark the length of the
                      hindarm opening up from the cuff end at each hindarm seam, notch in &frac14; inch
                      or one seam width, and then machine down each seam as illustrated by Fig. 303
  (d).</p>
  <p>Remove the tacking threads, turn out the cuff, baste up as in Fig. 303
                      (e), and lightly catch-stitch the edge of the turn-up to the sleeve and at
  the seams.</p>
  <p>Fold the sleeve over with the right sides of the material together (see
                      Fig. 303 (f)), baste the forearm seam to the inlay mark on the hindarm seam,
                      and then machine down the seam from the top of the sleeve to the hindarm
  opening notch.</p>
  <p>Cut across the hindarm seam inlay at a point approximately &frac12; inch above
                      the opening and then press open the hindarm seam as in Fig. 303 (g). Baste
                      the hindarm opening and then turn the sleeve inside-out and make a hand tack
                      to hold the opening in position. The tack may be made by invisible stitching
  or in the form of a button-hole stitch.</p>
  <p>Machine up the linings in the usual manner and then, to line the sleeves,
                      turn these inside out and baste the hindarm seam of the lining to the hindarm
                      seam of the sleeve, allowing a little ease in the length and with the lining
&frac34; inch to 1 inch longer than the sleeve at the top. Turn out the sleeve and
                      lining so that the lining is uppermost, and then trim the lining level with
                      the cuff. For a sleeve with an opened cuff, turn the lining up and tack round
                      over the sleeve inlay to show about 1 inch of cloth and, at the opening,
                      taper the lining back to the opening commencement as indicated- by Fig. 303
  (h).</p>
  <p>Fell round the cuff linings and turn out the sleeves after basting the
                      linings round the sleeve head at about 3 inches down from the sleeve crown to
  hold them while the sleeves are sewn to the armhole.</p>

  the Scye (Fig. 304)</h3>
  <p>Basting and sewing the sleeves into the armholes are perhaps the most
                      difficult operations for inexperienced workers to perform satisfactorily, and
                      even experienced workers are sometimes at fault. The trouble lies in the hang
                      of the sleeve in the scye and the distribution of sleeve-head fullness. These
                      fundamentally important operations are subject to the personal feeling of the
                      worker more than any other section of the making, and it is practically
                      impossible for any worker to baste two sleeves into a garment and be sure
                      that they are exact as regards hang and distribution of sleeve-head fullness.
                      With fullness distribution governed by trial by error methods, it is not to
                      be wondered that putting the sleeves into a garment is disliked by the
                      majority of dressmakers and tailoresses. The remedy lies in a systematic
                      distribution of the sleeve-head fullness by a system of balance notches on
                      the sleeve to agree with identical points on the scye, so as to control the
                      fullness in its correct proportion and position in the scye, and with
                      assistance from pinning to ensure that both sleeves are of identical balance
  before they are finally basted and machined.</p>
  <p>On the sleeve, after it has been lined, measure round the sleeve head from
                      the hindarm seam to the crown the distance from the normal back pitch to the
                      shoulder seam plus &frac12; inch for fullness, and make a balance notch on the
  crown as in Fig. 304 (a).</p>
  <p>Then measure from the front pitch on the scye to the underarm seam and
                      apply this quantity from the front pitch notch of the sleeve round the
  under-sleeve plus &frac14; inch as illustrated by Fig. 304 (b).</p>
  <p>To baste the sleeve into the scye, first baste the forearm seam notch to
                      the front scye pitch. This should be done on the outside of the coat and with
                      the seam of the sleeve hanging in the natural downward balance and not square
                      out from the front scye pitch, otherwise the sleeve hang will not be
                      satisfactory. The forearm sleeve notch should be placed about &frac14; inch above
                      the scye pitch so that, when the sleeve is sewn in, the reduction of a seam
  from the sleeve and the scye will bring the two pitches in alignment.</p>
  <p>When this operation has been effected, turn to the inside of the garment
                      and secure the hindarm sleeve seam to the scye notch, basting with the sleeve
                      seam running downwards in the natural balance. Similarly with the front
                      sleeve seam, the seam of the sleeve at the hindarm should be tacked just
                      above the back-scye pitch so that, when the seam is taken off, both pitches
  will be above each other.</p>
  <p>Pin the sleeve-head balance notch to the shoulder seam of the garment and
                      the under-sleeve balance notch to the underseam. At the hindarm between the
                      hindarm sleeve seam at the shoulder seam, pin the sleeve fullness into
                      position with more fullness towards the shoulder than towards the hindarm
  point.</p>
  <p>Round the front-scye from the shoulder seam to the front sleeve pitch,
                      distribute the sleeve fullness with three pins into three
    parts as illustrated by Fig. 304 (c). For a distance of 1&frac14; inches
    from the front sleeve pitch position do not ease any fullness into the scye,
    but just baste
  in easily, and not tightly.</p>
  <p>After the sleeves have been pinned and the balance of each checked up and
                      found correct, baste round the sleeves in each scye and remove the pins. The
                      right sleeve is basted from the front sleeve pitch round the under-scye to
                      the shoulder seam and thence down the front of the scye, while the left
                      sleeve is basted from the front pitch up the front of the scye to the
                      shoulder and then down the back-scye and round the under-scye. The difference
                      in the direction of the basting of the two sleeves is the primary cause of
                      unequally balanced sleeves when basting in without distributing the fullness
                      accurately with pins; for usually, when basting the left sleeve from the
                      front sleeve pitch to the shoulder, there is a tendency to work the sleeve
                      fullness too high in the scye and, conversely, when basting from the shoulder
                      down to the front pitch, the sleeve fullness gets distributed too low in the
                      scye. So it is always advisable to pin the fullness first and check each
  sleeve for balance before machining.</p>
  <p>Carefully press away the sleeve fullness down over the crown of the
                      sleeve, using a little water if the material is of an unyielding texture.
                      Another aid to shrinking away the fullness is the use of a little soap on the
                      seam. Always shrink the fullness before machining; otherwise the foot of the
  machine has a tendency to push the fullness out of place.</p>
  <p>In machining the sleeve into the scye, first carefully make sure that the
                      linings and canvas are clear from the machine, and then machine the right
                      sleeve in the reverse direction to the way it was tacked, that is, round the
                      front of the scye to the shoulder and thence to the under-scye and the front
                      pitch. The left sleeve is sewn from the front of the scye round the
                      under-scye to the shoulder and down the front of the scye in the reverse
                      direction to that for basting. After machining the sleeves into the scye,
                      take out all the basting tacks and carefully pare away all surplus material,
  leaving the sleeve and scye seams about 3/8 inch in width.</p>
  <p>Most women's coats are improved by the addition of a small pad on the top
                      of the shoulder point. The pad need not be very long or thick, but it
                      certainly gives a well-fitting shoulder in comparison with the usual
                      over-hanging shoulders on women's coats. Make the pad of double-ply wadding
                      and shape as illustrated by Fig. 304 (d) to about 5 inches by 3 inches at the
                      widest part. Tack together with silk, or baste and pare away the edges for
                      thinness. The pad should be shaped in a curve to match the shape of the
  shoulder in the tacking together of the two layers of wadding.</p>
  <p>A narrow strip of wadding is placed in the sleeve head between the seam
    of the scye downwards inside the sleeve to fill out the sleeve-head fullness.
                      This strip of wadding should extend from about 1&frac12; inches
                      from the front sleeve pitch to the hindarm pitch, and is
                      basted on the inside of the scye
  and sleeve seams to extend down the sleeve.</p>
  <p>The shoulder pad is then tacked to the seam of the scye and sleeve in the
                      following position: one-third of the length forward from the shoulder seam
                      and two-thirds of the pad back from the seam down the back-scye. Tack the pad
                      firmly in position with silk, and it may be caught down to the shoulder
                      canvas on the front shoulder. The pad, incidentally, is placed between the
  canvas and the lining.</p>
  <p>With the pads in position, the lining at the shoulders can be adjusted to
                      cover the pads and then tacked over and felled. The lining is then tacked
                      round the scye seams and any surplus width trimmed away, The cause of many
                      tight armholes is due to the linings and canvas not being trimmed cleanly
                      away from the scye seams. Make sure that the lining is not pulled out of
                      position or tight in any place. Many tailors make a split in the lining over
                      the shoulder point and cover it with a V-shaped piece of lining to allow the
  shoulder lining to open out over the prominent shoulder point.</p>
  <p>The sleeve lining is then tacked round the scye to cover the tack stitches
                      holding the linings and pads in position and felled down. Distribute the
                      sleeve-head lining fullness to agree with the sleeve fullness to prevent
  tightness across the sleeve linings over the crown.</p>
  <p>It is a fault with sleeve linings that they invariably come undone round
                      the under-scye in wear, and a good plan is to back-stitch round the
  under-sleeve lining at about 1/8 inch in from the felling stitches.</p>
  <p>The button-holes are the remaining item of the programme, and these should
  be made as described in Chapter XXI.</p>
  <h3><a name="bagged" id="bagged"></a>Making a Machine or Bagged Coat</h3>
  <p>With trade competition as it is to-day, the small tailor cannot always
                      afford to make a garment with the same quality of workmanship as the
                      better-class type when the price realized is not great. The wholesale houses
                      cut down the cost of production in the making by the use of special machinery
                      and the elimination of hand work, and the small tailor can benefit by a
                      similar thorough examination of his work to find out where time is spent
                      which can be saved by machine work without detriment to the finish of the
                      garment. Of course, the first essential to the reduction of hand workmanship
                      is accurate cutting to eliminate manipulation as much as possible. In the old
                      days, the tailor had to work the garment up because the cutter could not
                      visualize a garment cut to fit without all this stretching and drawing in,
                      but the wholesale tailors have shown that it is possible to cut a garment to
                      fit without the extreme manipulation tailors formerly infused into it. To a
                      certain extent, the old-time cutter was in the hands of his workman,
                      depending on him for assistance in making the garment fit, but these days the
                      cutter endeavours to cut his job to fit without the worker's assistance; in
                      other words, to eliminate the possibility of indifferent workmanship reacting
                      on the garment. Also, it is not possible to obtain workers who understand
                      manipulation these days, and, in any case, the prices for which garments must
                      be produced do not permit a lot of time spent on unnecessary hand work. To
                      adhere to hand workmanship as an example of keeping up the standard of
                      tailoring is a fool's game if the only reward is loss of custom and meagre
                      profits. In a high-class trade good workmanship is essential, but as the vast
                      majority of ladies' tailors and dressmakers cannot command the prices paid at
                      that end of the trade for costumes, coats or dresses, it is imperative that
                      they possess the ability to make garments with a clean finish with the least
  expenditure of time on hand sewing.</p>
  <p>The first essential towards the production of a machine-made garment is
                      very accurate cutting and trimming; without this accuracy success cannot be
  guaranteed and the garment will look like an inferior machine production.</p>
  <p>Inlays may be left as usual on both the lining and the outside, as these
                      have no effect on the actual making, except that they are nipped to prevent
  tying of the seams.</p>
  <p>For the machine-made example, a lounge style with a centre back seam and
    a gorge dart is chosen. The lapels are single-breasted and the fronts linked.
    Pockets are jeatted so that the same instructions as given in the previous
    tailoring
                      example will apply. A sleeve with a dummy opened cuff is
    included for a variation from the plain opened style.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><a name="cutout" id="cutout"></a><em><a href="illust/305.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,344);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/305-t.jpg" alt="Figure 305" width="119" height="220" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig305" id="fig305"></a>The Cut-out Garment (Fig. 305)</h3>
  <p>Fig. 305 illustrates the cut-out garment ready for tack marking. No inlays
                      are left round the back neck curve, shoulder seam and scye, and there are
                      only a sideseam inlay and a bottom edge turn-up. Fig. 305 (a) shows the back
                      with a centre seam added, while Fig. 305 (b) indicates the foreparts with an
                      underarm dart and a waist dart at the front. Figs. 305 (c) and (d) show the
  top and under-sleeves with a bottom edge turn-up only.</p>
  <p>Mark up all the inlays and the front waist dart by tacking stitches, and
                      then proceed to cut the linings and facing as follows.
    Firstly, mark back from the edge of the lapel the desired length of the step
    opening, about 1&frac14; to 1&frac12; inches plus &frac14; inch, and then
    make a notch at this point to indicate where the collar end should terminate.
    Before the linings are cut,
                      the gorge dart should be sewn out to obtain the actual
    size of the lapels for the facing shape.</p>
  <p>At the bottom edge, make a chalk mark on the garment to where the bottom
                      turn-up will turn back when finished. Mark this line of the back and
  foreparts, and then cut the back lining out as indicated by Fig. 306.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><a name="cutlining" id="cutlining"></a><em><a href="illust/306.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',583,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/306-t.jpg" alt="Figure 306" width="240" height="161" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig306" id="fig306"></a>Cutting Out the Linings (Fig.
  306)</h3>
  <p>For a distance of about 2 inches from the back neck curve cut the lining
                      to the shape of the centre back-seam, and then add about &frac34; inch out to
                      allow for a lining pleat from this point to the waist level. From the waist
                      level to the bottom edge cut the lining as the centre back seam. From the
                      back neck curve add &frac14; inch on the length upwards, and spring out to &frac12;
    inch on the shoulder end and round the back-scye to cover the shoulder-pad
  thickness.</p>
  <p>From the top of the sideseam to the waist level taper the extra quantity
                      from &frac12; inch to nothing at the waist, and continue down to the bottom edge
  as the side-seam shape.</p>
  <p>The length of the lining is cut 1 inch longer than the chalk mark to which
                      the bottom edge inlay turns back; &frac12; inch is allowed for two seams and about
&frac12; inch for ease in the length.</p>
  <p>On the forepart, cut the facing to the shape of the gorge run from the
                      neck point to the end of the lapel, and add about &frac14; inch on the length of
                      the facing above the end of the lapel and &frac12; inch on the width down the
                      lapel to taper away at the break of the crease line in the waist. Measure
                      back from the end of the facing and make a balance notch for the collar equal
  to the length of the step plus &frac14; inch.</p>
  <p>On the shoulders, cut the facing about 2 inches in width and shape down
                      the front to about 4&frac12; inches in width at the bottom
                      edge. The length of the facing should be &frac34; inch
                      longer than the chalk mark to which the bottom edge inlay
                      turns back; &frac12; inch is for seams and &frac14; inch
                      for ease.</p>
  <p>Cut the forepart lining to lap &frac12; inch over the facing down the fronts,
                      and from &frac34; inch at the facing and 1 inch at the sideseam longer than the
                      inlay chalk mark, to agree with the length of the back lining. At the
                      shoulder, add &frac12; inch to the lining on the shoulder end and round the scye
                      to the sideseam, and spring out the sideseam lining at the breast line about
&frac12; inch to taper back to nothing at the waist line.</p>
  <p>The underarm dart should be cut out of the lining to agree with the
  outside, and the waist dart sewn out without cutting.</p>
  <h3><a name="cutcanvas" id="cutcanvas"></a>Cutting the Canvas</h3>
  <p>The canvas should be cut before the gorge dart is sewn out as the latter
                      must be taken from, the canvas to give the same foundation shape as the
                      outside. Cut the canvas about &frac14; inch wider down the lapels to the break and
                      thence as the shape of the front edge of the garment to the bottom edge
                      inlay. Cut wide enough to cover the pocket opening and to take the tack, and
  mark out a &frac12; inch waist dart in the position indicated.</p>
  <p>Another method of cutting the canvas in order to obtain more breast shape
                      and spring over the shoulder prominence is illustrated in Fig. 306. A seam is
                      run from the shoulder seam to the waist line and &frac12; inch reduced upwards
                      from the waist and then on the shoulder, the scye section of the canvas being
                      overlapped &frac12; inch to &frac34; inch as shown by the draft. When the seams are
                      sewn together, the scye edge of the canvas will have a certain amount of
&quot;spring&quot; to allow for the prominence of the shoulder point. Allow a
  seam on each section when cutting this canvas.</p>

  307)</h3>
  <p>The under-collar should be cut as described in the chapter on <a href="lgcm-13.html">Collar
                      Cutting</a> with the following attention to detail as shown
    in Fig. 307 (a). Make sure that the length is a seam past the step balance
    notch. The width of the
                      fall edge at the centre back seam should be 1&frac34; inches
                      for a 1&frac12;-inch
                      fall depth and the stand 1&frac14; inches for a finished
                      depth of 1 inch. At the step end, make the width of the
                      collar step equal to the required width plus
  two seams, 2 inches in all for a 1&frac12;-inch step.</p>
  <p>The top-collar is cut &frac14; inch longer than the under-collar and &frac12; inch
                      wider round the fall edge as illustrated by the dash lines in Fig. 307
  (b).</p>
  <p>Every section of the garment must be cut to fit for perfection and ease of
                      making, and this principle applies more to the collar and facing cutting than
                      that of any other part of the garment. With every part accurately cut and
                      fitted, the facing can be machined round without basting, though it is always
                      advisable to spend the little extra time in tacking. The author has made
                      coats and machined the facing on without basting, but it is not to be
  recommended.</p>

  (Fig. 308)</h3>
  <p>Firstly, seam the centre seam of the back as illustrated by Fig. 308 (a),
                      press open the seam, and then insert the pockets into the foreparts as
                      described in the previous tailoring example. Briefly described, the first
                      operation is to baste linen across the pocket opening on the inside of the
                      garment from the fronts to the sideseam, and then sew the bottom pocket to
                      the bottom facing and tack the bottom and top pocket facings to the pocket
                      opening on the outside of the garment. Machine across the facings to the
                      length of opening required, then cut through the opening to within &frac12; inch
                      of each end, and slash diagonally to each corner where the machine stitching
                      finishes. Pull the top and bottom facings through the opening from the
                      outside and press open the seams of the jeattings and the coat. Baste the
                      jeattings to the correct width, tack the pocket backing section to the pocket
                      opening, and stitch round after having first machine-tacked through the
                      bottom jeatting to hold it in place. Turn to the outside of the garment and
                      press the pocket into shape before tacking the top facing and backing to the
  canvas and sideseam stay.</p>
  <p> A jeatted pocket should not take longer than ten
                        minutes at the outside for an experienced worker to insert.
    The author once put in two side jeatted pockets in a shade over fourteen
    minutes when he was
    in a hurry, but this cannot be taken as a general rule.</p>
  <p>Fig. 308 (b) illustrates the foreparts with pockets in and darts seamed
  and pressed, and now the canvas can be made and tacked to the fronts.</p>
  <p>To eliminate a part of the hand work, the author always machines the linen
                      edge stay to the canvases instead of by hand. This is a very good method and
                      saves quite a lot of time. Cut &frac34; inch from the canvases down the front edge
                      from the step to the bottom edge and back from the step end to &frac34; inch past
                      the step balance notch as in Fig. 308 (c). Cut a strip of linen 1 inch in
                      width and machine this to the edge of the canvas, with the linen on top and
                      the canvas underneath on the machine, so that the linen is sewn on tightly to
                      the canvas as in Fig. 308 (d). Press away the ease in the canvas, then baste
                      the canvases to the fronts in the usual manner, and complete the tacking of
  the jeatted pockets, as shown in Fig. 308 (e).</p>
  <p>Contrary to the previous tailoring methods described, the back is joined
                      to the fronts before the linings are made and, to this end, machine the back
  to the forepart as illustrated by Fig. 308 (f) and press open the seams.</p>
  <p>join the shoulder seams of the back and foreparts together, making sure to
                      allow plenty of ease in the back shoulder seam when basting, and machine and
  press open.</p>
  <p>The canvas should be caught down to the shoulder seams after they have
                      been pressed open, and the coat is now ready for the under-collar to be sewn
  round the neck curve.</p>
  <h3><a name="under" id="under"></a>Making the Under-collar</h3>
  <p>The under-collar is made without hand-padding of the fall edge for a
  machine-made garment, as padding is wasteful of time to a great extent.</p>
  <p>Cut the collar canvas on the bias in the usual manner, and then tack to
  the under-collar after the seams have been machined and pressed open.</p>
  <p>Stitch the stand of the collar to within &frac12; inch of the fall sewing edge
                      with four rows of stitching, and then pad the fall by diagonal machine
                      stitching as illustrated by Fig. 308 (g). Fold the collar in half in the
                      crease-line mark, shrink in the crease line as described previously and pare
                      away the canvas from the fall edge to allow for the machine stitching round
  the edge.</p>
  <p>Sew the under-collar to the neck curve by first tacking at the centre back
                      seam and then checking up the length by basting each end of the collar one
                      seam in advance of the step balance notch, so that when a seam is taken from
                      the lapel and a seam from the collar end the step will be the required width.
                      Baste the collar completely round the gorge, working from the centre back to
  each end and allowing a little ease in the gorge opposite the shoulder.</p>
  <p>Machine round the collar from end to end, take out the tacking thread and
                      press open the collar and gorge seams. Do not stitch past the balance notch
  of the step at each end.</p>
  <p>Catch the canvas of the under-collar to the seam of the gorge all round
                      the neck, and then mark the crease line on each forepart to run with the
  collar crease edge.</p>
  <p>The crease-line stay of linen is basted on in the usual manner as
                      illustrated by Fig. 308 (h) with a little drawing in of the material from the
                      gorge downwards. Sometimes the linen stay is dispensed with and a narrow
                      stay-tape machine-stitched down the crease line from the gorge to the first
  button position, but the better method is staying with linen.</p>
  <p>Pad-stitch the lapels as usual by working from the crease line towards the
                      lapel edge until completed, and then press away the length worked on to the
  lapels by the padding action.</p>
  <h3><a name="makelining" id="makelining"></a>Making the Linings</h3>
  <p>Trace through the inlay marks on to the lining from the outside and then
                      machine down the centre back seam. The back lining is cut on the fold of the
                      material for the pleat, so that it is not necessary to machine down this.
                      Machine out the front darts and then join the facing by machining with the
                      lining on top of the facing to prevent drawing in under the machine foot.
                      Special care must be exercised to ensure that the linings and facing are of
                      the same length at the bottom edge for sewing to the bottom edge inlay of the
                      coat. Join up the sideseams and shoulder seams and press the seam over one
  way to hide the machine stitching.</p>
  <p>The top-collar is slightly stretched at the fall edge and shrunk to the
                      shape of the under-collar at the crease line, and then sewn round the neck
                      curve of the lining. First, baste the centre of the collar to the centre seam
                      of the lining, and then tack each collar end a seam in advance of the balance
                      notch at the step. Completely tack the collar on the lining, and machine
                      round the neck and press open the seam. Do not machine past the balance
  notches.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><a name="linecoat" id="linecoat"></a><em><a href="illust/309.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,715);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/309-t.jpg" alt="Figure 309" width="232" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig309" id="fig309"></a>Lining the Coat (Fig. 309)</h3>
  <p>After all the seams have been pressed on the out-sides and linings,
                      commence to tack the lining to the coat ready for machining round the
  edge.</p>
  <p>Tack the collar seams together from one step end to the other round the
                      neck curve, making sure that the seams are perfectly above
    each other, and separate the collar ends from the notched step. Baste round
    the collar fall
                      edge, easing the top-collar to the under-collar up the
    step and for a small distance along the fall edge to the other end of the
    collar.</p>
  <p>Baste the facing to the lapel from the notch of the step to the end of the
                      step, easing the facing on to the lapel over this part, and then baste down
                      the lapel edge, working a little ease in length of the facing on to the lapel
                      for a distance of approximately 2 inches down from the step. Continue basting
                      down to the end of the facing, and then baste the edge of the bottom inlay to
  the lining and facing edge from one side of the garment to the other.</p>
  <p>Fig. 309 (a) illustrates the facing basted to the outside with details of
                      the collar-end treatment and the sewing together of the facing and coat
  turn-up at the bottom-edge.</p>
  <p>To machine on the facing, firstly machine across the bottom inlay seam and
                      press open this seam before doing anything else. When the seam has been
                      pressed open, tack from the inlay seam to the bottom edge of the fronts and
                      machine up from the fold bottom edge to the notch of the step. Do not catch
                      the collar in with this stitching but fasten off and then commence to machine
                      round the collar by separating the collar end from the step and machining
                      from the notch of the collar. When machining round the step of the lapel,
                      make sure that the machine stitching runs in a perfect line with the seam of
                      the collar and facing; otherwise there will be a break in the continuation of
                      the collar seam to the end of the step when the facing is turned out.
                      Continue down the opposite side of the garment after sewing round the collar.
                      Make sure of fastening off the machining at the collar ends and the facing to
  ensure a perfect joining up of the collar and lapel at the step.</p>
  <p>Take out all the basting stitches, trim the edge seams down to a minimum,
                      and turn the coat out through the armhole. Carefully turn out the lapel
                      corners and commence to baste round the edge of the coat from the left lapel
                      round the collar to the right lapel and fronts. Completely baste round the
                      fronts, turn the bottom edge up to the inlay marking threads, and baste along
                      the bottom as illustrated by Fig. 309 (b). Baste over the collar, working on
                      a quantity of length estimated by tacking the collar seams together and
  working the fullness upwards to the collar fall.</p>
  <p>Baste over the lapels, working a length of facing over the corner of the
                      step and rolling the lapel in the fingers from the edge to the crease line.
                      When this has been completed, fold the lapel over to retain the facing length
                      and then baste down the facing inside the coat on the facing and lining seam.
                      Tack the sideseams of the lining to the coat sideseams, baste the centre seam
                      of the lining to the centre seam of the outside, and tack the lining round
  each armhole at a distance of 2 inches or so from the edge.</p>

  (Figs. 310 and 311)</h3>
  <p>The sleeves are made with a dummy opened cuff and are cut with inlays at
                      the hindarm seams on the top and under-sleeves for the opening as described
  in Chapter XVIII.</p>
  <p>Fig. 310 (a) shows the cutting of the sleeve linings for machine-made
                      sleeves. Mark the point to which the cuff inlay turns back on the sleeve and
                      then cut the length of the lining two seams longer than the chalk mark. At
                      the sleeve head, cut the lining &frac34; inch longer and about 3/8 inch wider
  outside the sleeve fore and hindarm seams as indicated in Fig. 310 (a).</p>
  <p>Notch the cuff inlays at each sleeve seam and then commence to make the
  sleeves as follows&#8212;</p>
  <p>Place the right side of the top-sleeve to the right side of the material
                      of the under-sleeve, tack the opening inlays together as illustrated by Fig.
                      310 (b), and machine down the top and under-sleeve hindarm seams to about &frac34;
    inch past the commencement of the opening inlays. Press open the seam, then
                      turn to the outside of the sleeve, and tack the opening down as indicated by
                      Fig. 310 (c). Press the opening and cut away the inlay below the sleeve end
  for thinness.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illust/311.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,413);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/311-t.jpg" alt="Figure 311" width="131" height="195" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig311" id="fig311"></a>Next join the linings by machining the hindarm seams of the top and
                      under-sleeves together. Do not machine the forearm seams together, but tack
                      the sleeve linings to the cuff inlay at the bottom edge and machine from the
                      forearm to the hindarm seam as in Fig. 311 (a). Press this seam up with the
                      lining lapped over the cloth, tack completely down the forearm seams, and
                      machine right through from the sleeve head of the outside sleeve to the
  sleeve head of the lining in one continuous line as in Fig. 311 (b).</p>
  <p>Press open the forearm seams and then pull the lining up over the sleeve
                      until the inlay is turned up to the correct length as in Fig. 311 (c). Catch
                      the seams at the forearm together and then baste round the lining at the
                      sleeve head to prevent it rolling down when the sleeves are inserted into the
  coat.</p>
  <p>Fig. 311 (d) shows the sleeve finished with dummy holes and buttons which
  keep the opening in position.</p>
  <p>After the sleeves have been sewn into each arm-hole, the coat only needs
                      button-holing and the buttons sewn on to complete for pressing off. As there
                      is no difference in the methods of sewing in the sleeves, it is not necessary
  to repeat the instructions from the previous example.</p>
  <p>Working on the above methods of making, it is an easy matter for one
                      person to make a jacket entirely from the cutting out to the pressing off in
                      a matter of six to seven hours. This may also be a generous estimate easily
                      beaten by an experienced wholesale worker. The author can make a jacket in
                      the above time and he is not as quick in some tailoring points as others, but
                      systematic organization and accurate cutting and fitting knock many minutes
  off the total time taken in making a garment.</p>

    Collars for Double-Breasted Lapels (Fig. 312)</h3>
  <p>Machine collars for double-breasted lapels are somewhat more difficult to
    make in comparison with single-breasted lapels and are treated as follows.</p>
  <p>The collar is drafted to two seams past the peak edge of the lapel and two
                      seams below the gorge run, and the stand depth is made
    1&frac14; inches and the
                      fall depth at the centre back seam 1&frac34; inches. Make
                      the step end of the collar to the desired width. The author
                      prefers a narrow strap collar and
                      makes the width of the step end 1&frac12; inches plus
                      two seams, as in Fig. 312 (a).</p>
  <p>Make up the collar as described for the single-breasted shape, tack round
    the gorge from the centre back seam to two seams past the lapel peak,
    make a vertical notch downwards from the corner of the gorge at the peak
    as illustrated by
                      Fig. 312 (b), and sew the collar to one seam past the peak
    to this notch. The facing is notched in a similar manner and the top-collar
    sewn two seams past
  the peak of the lapel.</p>
  <p>Fig. 312 (c) indicates the facing basted to the under-collar and lapels.
                      Work plenty of facing length on to the collar end and lapel
    peak, and then sew round the facing from the bottom edge to the notch as
    indicated by the
                      stitch marks. Fasten off the machining, and sew round the
    collar end as a fall edge to the other side of the coat. A seam from the
    lapel peak and a
                      seam taken from the collar end account for the two seams
    overlapping when the collar is drafted, and now the collar and lapels are
    level with each other as
                      illustrated by the basted-over lapel and collar of Fig.
    312 (d). All collars of the double-breasted or ulster type are similarly
    made; in all instances where there
                      is a pointed lapel, allow the collar to come two seams
    past the edge of the point so that the reduction of a seam from the collar
    and from the lapel
                      point will result in the parts finishing level when they
    have been basted out.</p>

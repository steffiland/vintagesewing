  <p>THE adaptation of the standard dress basis system to the cutting of
evening gowns presents no difficulties. Apart from the extra length, not
affecting constructional points, the system for evening gowns is identical
with the basic dress system with modification of ease allowances.</p>
  <p>Modern evening gowns are form-fitting and are required to mould to the
figure without any superfluous ease at the waist and hips. Occasionally the
bust is draped loosely by the bodice, but, generally speaking, evening gowns
are mostly cut to show a minimum of fullness or drapery in the bodice.</p>
<p>At the moment, modern evening gown design varies between the Romantic
ideal and the severely Classical line, depending entirely upon the material
in which the gown is made up. For instance, chiffons, organdies, organzas or
similar materials are intended for designs frivolous in character for the
young girl, stressing femininity with wide flaring flounces and frills about
the shoulders and hem line or streamer frills cascading round the skirt from
waist to hem line.</p>
<p>The heavier materials such as satin, crepe, marocain, and the like are
designed on svelte lines, with the slender silhouette always emphasized.
Usually the slender line is carried down the skirt to the knee level, thence
to flare softly to the width at the hem line. Decolletages are alternatively
draped high, cut square or slashed down in a deep V at the front;
occasionally the off-shoulder line is seen. At the back, the decolletage is
invariably cut low to the waist line or, if high, slit to show the back.</p>
<p>A few evening dress designs are shown with sleeves, either close-fitting
to the wrist or with top fullness. The neck line at the front is draped high
about the throat, the back line is low, and a straight, clinging skirt ends
in a slight train.</p>
<p>These are a few of the highlights of evening dress design at the moment,
and, as all designs are evolved from each other, in the following drafts and
designs the author will endeavour to illustrate the basic principles of
cutting evening gowns which show style tendencies calling for detailed
explanation.</p>
<p>As the majority of evening gowns are designed without shoulder covering
except a narrow shoulder strap, it is necessary to eliminate the shoulder
dart from the system to simplify construction when drafting. The elimination
of the shoulder dart does not imply that the need for bust shape in the
bodice is ignored, but, instead, the dart is transferred to the underarm
sideseam and standardized in this position.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a name="eliminate" id="eliminate"></a><em><a href="illust/150.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,697);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/150-t.jpg" alt="Figure 150" width="226" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig150" id="fig150"></a>Elimination of the Shoulder Dart
(Fig. 150)</h3>
<p>There is always need for bust shape in the bodice of a dress, and, to
obtain this shape, the shoulder dart is the most scientific medium; but if
the shoulder is of such a width that a dart is impossible, the required bust
shape must be achieved by other means giving a similar effect to that of the
shoulder dart. The author always prefers the underarm dart for dresses except
in the case of a figure with a very prominent bust; then he uses two darts,
the shoulder dart and an additional dart at the sideseam, giving extra length
over the bust prominence in addition to the shape created by the shoulder
dart. The shoulder dart creates shape, but not length, and, when cutting for
women with abnormal development of the bust, the author has found that the
shoulder dart alone is unsatisfactory, for there is an apparent need for
length as well as shape over the bust. Adding length by increasing the front
shoulder depth does not meet the demands of the figure shape, and so a
sideseam dart, formed by adding a quantity of extra length at the hem line,
must be taken out.</p>
<p>After this divergence from the subject, to eliminate the shoulder dart and
subsequent transfer to the sideseam examine Fig. 150 (a).</p>

<p>Fig. 150 (a) illustrates the bodice front as drafted by the basic system
for dresses, showing the shoulder construction incorporating a dart from the
shoulder to the bust for bust-shape provision.</p>
<p>Based upon a 36-inch bust girth, the constructional points are found in
the following manner&#8212;</p>
    <ul class="small">
      <li>Square from 1 which represents the centre front at the breast
line.</li>
	<li>2 from 1 = one-fourth of the bust girth plus &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li> Square up from 1 to 3 one-third of the scale (18 inches) plus 1&frac12;
inches.</li>
	<li>4 from 3 = one-twelfth of the scale.</li>
	<li>Square out from 4 to 5 one-sixth of the scale.</li>
	<li>6 from 1 = the across-chest measure = one-fourth of the scale less 1
inch.</li>
	<li>7 from 6 = one-sixth of the scale less &frac14; inch.</li>
	<li>8 from 7 = the distance from 1 to 4 less &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>Join the construction line from 8 to 9 to the back shoulder point as
described in the basis dress system and make the distance from 8 to 9 equal
to the width of the back shoulder seam less &frac14; inch.</li>
	<li>10 from 9 = 1 inch. Shape the front shoulder seam from 10 to 8.</li>
	<li>Shape the front of the scye from 10 to 2, hollowing &frac14; inch in advance
of the line squared up from 6.</li>
	<li>11 is midway of 1 to 6.</li>
	<li>Join 8 to 11 and continue down 2 inches to 12.</li>
	<li>13 from 8 = the width of the bust dart = 8 to 5.</li>
	<li>Join 13 to 12 to complete the shape of the shoulder dart.</li>
	<li>14 from 2 for the position of the sideseam bust dart = one-sixth of the
scale = 3 inches.</li>
	<li>Join 14 to 12 for preliminary construction.</li>
	<li>15 from 4 = one-sixth of the scale. Shape the neck curve from 15 to
5.</li>
	</ul>
<p>The draft of the front bodice is now completed, and to reconstruct the
shoulder section without the dart, cut through from 14 to 12 and from 8 and
13 to the same point.</p>
<p>Fig. 150 (b) illustrates the procedure adopted for obtaining an underarm
sideseam dart. After the pattern has been cut through from 13 and 8 to 12 and
from 14 to 12, eliminate the shoulder dart by closing 13 to 8 to open the
line from 14 to 12. The solid lines from 5 to 8, 10, 2, and 14A show the
reconstructed bodice shape. From 14 to 14A is the quantity to be reduced from
the sideseams in the dart from 14 and 14A to 16. This dart is made from 3 to
4 inches in length, varying according to the quantity taken out of the dart.
As the shoulder dart is closed out from 13 to 8, there is a loss of
across-chest width at it of approximately &frac12; inch, or the width apart of
the
bust dart lines at this point, which brings points 6 and 7 nearer to the
centre front. But as the actual across-chest width is smaller than a similar
measure taken over the bust, the reduction is correct in the cutting of a
shoulder section without the shoulder dart. The neck-point construction line
from 7 coincides with the position of the front neck point at 5. Therefore,
to reconstruct the shoulder section without a shoulder dart, we must embody
the shape of the reconstructed shoulder by system direct, without
manipulation. To do this, it is necessary to estimate the quantity to be
taken from the sideseam dart and to construct the shoulder section in its
closed-out shape as illustrated by the solid lines of Fig. 150 (b).</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a name="reconstruct" id="reconstruct"></a><em><a href="illust/151.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,364);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/151-t.jpg" alt="Figure 151" width="115" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig151" id="fig151"></a>Reconstruction Draft of the
Shoulder Section (Fig. 151)</h3>
<p>Fig. 151 illustrates the standard shoulder construction for the drafting
of evening-dress patterns. It will be seen that the construction line finding
the neck point from the one-sixth of scale position in advance of the front
of the scye is eliminated from the draft.</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>Square from point 1 at the centre front.</li>
	<li>2 from 1 = one-fourth of the bust measure plus &frac12; inch, the usual side
seam position.</li>
	<li>3 squared up from 1 = one-third of the scale plus 1&frac14; inches.</li>
	<li>4 from 3 = one-twelfth of the scale.</li>
	<li>Square out from 4 to 5 one-sixth of the scale.</li>
	<li>6 from 1 = the across-chest width = one-fourth of the bust measure less
1&frac14; inches.
	  <ul>
	    <li>A reduction of &frac14; inch takes place to make up for the quantity lost
    when the bust dart is closed out at point 11 in Fig. 150 (b).</li>
      </ul>
	</li>
	<li>7 is midway of 1 to 6.</li>
	<li>8 from 2 = the estimated quantity to be taken from the sideseam bust
dart by closing out the shoulder dart. This quantity is calculated as
one-twelfth of the scale less &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>Join 7 to 8 as shown.</li>
	<li>Pivoting from 7, sweep from 6 to locate point 9 on the line from 7 to
8.</li>
	<li>Join 5 to the back shoulder end in the usual manner to find the front
shoulder slope.</li>
	<li>10 from 5 = the back shoulder width less &frac14; inch.</li>
	<li>11 from 10 = &frac12; inch. Shape the front shoulder seam from 11 to 5.</li>
	<li>12 from 8 = &frac12; inch. Shape the front of the scye as shown, hollowing
&frac14; inch in advance of the line squared up from 9.</li>
	<li>13 from 12 = one-sixth of the scale.</li>
	<li>Shape from 12 to 13.</li>
	<li>14 from 13 = the quantity taken from the bust dart as indicated by 2 to
8.</li>
	<li>Shape out the sideseam bust dart to 15 3&frac12; inches in length to
complete the bodice draft.</li>
	</ul>
<p>The shoulder construction as described will be incorporated in all the
evening-gown drafts, unless the shoulder design shows a dart, in which case
the standard basis system must be utilized.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a name="stdevening" id="stdevening"></a><em><a href="illust/152.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,274);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/152-t.jpg" alt="Figure 152" width="100" height="236" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig152" id="fig152"></a>Standard Evening Dress Basis
System (Fig. 152)</h3>
    <p>In the successful cutting of evening dresses there is the need for
specialized knowledge of cutting to a finished measure without ease or
fullness. The allowance of ease over the half-bust measure usually allowed
for dresses is reduced by &frac12; inch, for evening dresses must always fit
snugly round the edges of the decolletage. Waist suppression is reduced to
practically the net measure, and a sideseam opening is provided for the
wearer to get into the dress. Whenever possible, an all-round waist seam
should be incorporated in the draft to achieve a perfectly fitting waist
without the disadvantages of surplus material at the back waist hollow.</p>
<p>For the construction of the basic draft, the following proportionate
measures, in this case based on a 36-inch bust girth, are necessary&#8212;</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>Chest = 34 inches.</li>
	<li>Bust = 36 inches.</li>
	<li>Waist = 27 inches, increased by 2 inches for ease.</li>
	<li>Hips = 39 inches.</li>
	<li>Natural waist length = 14&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>Full dress length = 52 inches.</li>
	<li>Half-back width = 6&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>Working scale = half the bust girth for all sizes under 36 inches and
one-third of the bust girth plus 6 inches for all sizes over 36 inches.</li>
	<li>Scale = 18 inches for a 36-inch bust girth.</li>
	</ul>
<p>To draft&#8212;</p>
<p>Commence by drawing line X to X, the full dress length.</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>1 from X = one-third of the scale plus 1&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>2 from X = the natural waist length.</li>
	<li>3 from 2 = the hip level = 8 inches down from the waist line.</li>
	<li>Square out from the above points.</li>
	<li>4 from X = the back neck width = one-sixth of the scale less &frac14;
inch.</li>
	<li>5 from 4 = the back neck height = &frac34; inch. Shape from 5 to X.</li>
	<li>6 from 1 = the half-back width. Square up from 6 to 7 on the
construction line squared out from X.</li>
	<li>8 from 3 on the hip balance line = half the hip measure net.</li>
	<li>Square up and down from 8 to locate points 9, 10, 11 and 12.</li>
	<li>13 from 11 = one-twelfth of the scale.</li>
	<li>Square back from 13 to 14 one-sixth of the scale.</li>
	<li>The sideseam is located at 15, half the distance from 3 to 8.</li>
	<li>Square up and down from 15 to 16, 17 and 18 at the hem line.</li>
	<li>Overlap the sideseams at 19 and 20 from 18 1&frac12; inches each side.</li>
	<li>Join 20 and 19 to 15 for the sideseam outline runs.</li>
	<li>Measure up from 10 to 21 half the bust measure plus &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>Reduce the surplus quantity shown by 1 to 21 from the sideseams at 22
and 23 to 17 equally.</li>
	<li>24 from 10 = half the scale less 1&frac14; inches.</li>
	<li>25 is midway of 10 to 24.</li>
	<li>Square up from 22 to 26 one-twelfth of the scale less &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>By pivoting from 25, sweep from 24 to 27 on the line joining 25 to
26.</li>
	<li>28 from 26 = &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>The back shoulder slope from 7 to 29 = 1 inch.</li>
	<li>30 from 29 = &frac14; inch. Shape the back shoulder seam from 30 to 5.</li>
	<li>Join 14 to 30 as shown.</li>
	<li>31 from 14 = the width of the back shoulder seam from 30 to 5 less &frac14;
inch.</li>
	<li>32 from 31 = &frac12; inch. Shape the front shoulder seam from 32 to 14.</li>
	<li>Shape the front-scye from 32 to 28, hollowing &frac14; inch in advance of the
line from 27.</li>
	<li>Shape the back-scye from 23 to 30.</li>
	<li>Square down from 22 and 23 to 33 and 34 on the waist line.</li>
	<li>Suppress the sideseams at 33 and 34 to 35 and 36 by &frac12; inch in each
instance.</li>
	<li>Measure down from 28 to 37 one-sixth of the scale for the position of
the sideseam bust dart.</li>
	<li>38 from 37 = the quantity taken from the bust dart, equal to the
distance from 22 to 26.</li>
	<li>Shape out the dart, as shown, 3&frac12; inches in length.</li>
	<li>Measure up from 2 to 39 half the waist measure (29 inches).</li>
	<li>40 from 39 = the distance from 35 to 36.</li>
	<li>The back waist suppression takes two-thirds of the surplus shown from 40
to 41.</li>
	<li>The front waist suppression takes the remaining third of the surplus
from 41 to 9.</li>
	<li>Mark out the back waist suppression from 2 to 42 by one-sixth of the
scale plus &frac12; inch. This distance is comparative and varies with different
designs in its position.</li>
	<li>43 from 42 = the back waist suppression as decided by the distance from
40 to 41.</li>
	<li>44 from 3 = the distance from 2 to 42 plus &frac12; inch.</li>
	<li>The centre of the back shoulder seam is located at 45.
	  <ul>
	    <li>The shoulder-strap width for all evening dresses is decided at this
    stage and the width is divided equally each side of this point.</li>
      </ul>
	</li>
	<li>Mark out the back waist suppression from 42 and 43 to 45, terminating
the suppression at point 46, level with the shoulder blade.
	  <ul>
	    <li>The waist suppression lines from 42 and 43 are mainly utilized to
    reduce the back bodice width at the top edge to measure and the need for
    closing out the back waist suppression only extends to the same edge of the
    back decolletage.</li>
      </ul>
	</li>
	<li>The front waist suppression is indicated by point 47, one-sixth of the
scale plus &frac12; inch from 9. Again this distance is comparative and subject to
the demands of fashion.</li>
	<li>48 from 47 = the front waist suppression, as indicated from 41 to 9.</li>
	<li>Mark out the waist suppression in the form of a dart to 49 7 inches from
points 47 and 48.</li>
	<li>50 from 48 and 47 = 4 inches. Shape out the waist suppression as
shown.</li>
	</ul>
<p>This completes the basic draft for evening-dress patterns.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a name="dinner" id="dinner"></a><em><a href="illust/153a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,478);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/153-t.jpg" alt="Figure 153" width="168" height="220" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig153" id="fig153"></a>A Dinner Dress Design (Fig. 153)</h3>
<p>The dinner dress design illustrated by Fig. 153 has interesting treatment
of the bodice with a brassiere effect over the bust to give fullness, shaped
yoke seams over the hips at back and front to keep the hip line slim, and a
moderately straight skirt effect.</p>
<p>Long sleeves are shown, darted to give width and fullness at the shoulders
and tapering to a close fit at the wrist.</p>
<p>This design would be very successful carried out in lace over satin, crepe
or similar plain contrasting materials.</p>
<p>The draft is arranged to the following measures&#8212;</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>Chest = 34 inches.</li>
	<li>Bust = 36 inches.</li>
	<li>Waist = 27 inches, increased to 29 inches for the draft.</li>
	<li>Hips = 39 inches.</li>
	<li>Natural waist length = 14&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>Full dress length = 52 inches.</li>
	<li>Working scale = one-third of the bust girth plus 6 inches = 18
inches.</li>
	</ul>
<p>To draft&#8212;</p>
<p>Commence by drawing line from X to X, the full dress length, i.e. 52
inches.</p>
	<ul class="small">
	<li>1 from X = one-third of the scale plus 1&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>2 from X = the natural waist length =14&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>3 from 2 = the hip level = 8 inches down from the natural waist
line.</li>
	<li>Square out from the above numbered points.</li>
	<li>4 from X = one-sixth of the scale less &frac14; inch.</li>
	<li>5 from 4 = &frac34; inch. Shape the back neck curve from 5 to X.</li>
	<li>6 from 1 = the normal half-back width = 6&frac12; inches.</li>
	<li>Square up from 6 to 7 on the construction line squared out from X.
	  <ul>
	    <li>The marking-out of the half-back width and back neck curve is
    necessary for the correct location of the shoulder straps.</li>
      </ul>
	</li>
	<li>8 from 3 = half the hip measure net.</li>
	<li>Square up and down from 8 to locate points 9, 10, 11 and 12 at the hem
line.</li>
	<li>13 from 11 = one-twelfth of the scale.</li>
	<li>14 from 13 = one-sixth of the scale.</li>
	<li>The sideseams are located at point 15, half the distance from 3 to
8.</li>

(Fig. 154)</h3>
    <p>Fig. 154 illustrates the manipulation of the back and bodice patterns
in order to allow for darts or gathers over the bust in the bodice and
suppression at the back waist in a dart.</p>
<p>Cut round the back pattern from X to 5, 34, 23, 27, 53, 54 and 55. Then
close the waist suppression lines together at 54, pivoting from 43, this
operation reducing the waist suppression at 39 to 40, which is taken out in a
dart 8 inches in length as marked. Alternatively the suppression quantity can
be taken out in two smaller darts so as to spread the effect more equally
across the back waist.</p>
	<p>Cut round the bodice pattern from 47 to 10, 48 and 46. Then mark up the
dart lines at A, B and C to D, E and F. Cut through these dart lines and then
wedge the pattern open at A, B and C to D, E and F, opening out each dart &frac12;
to 1 inch, depending on the amount of fullness required over the bust.</p>
<p>The fullness may be either reduced in the form of small tucks or gathered
smoothly at the centre of the panel seam between 48 to 10 from A to C.</p>

Flounces (Fig. 155)</h3>
<p>The design illustrated by the draft has interest in the low skirt flare
and the shoulder flounce flared to fall in soft folds over the shoulders from
the low front V neck line to run down the edge of the deep V opening to the
back waist. The bodice front is perfectly plain in cut from the waist line to
the shoulders; at the back the bodice is cut away at the back of the armhole
under the shoulder flounce. A seam is placed through the waist from front to
back to facilitate the fitting of the dress. The sideseam ends at a point
below the hip level and, from this point, is eliminated, and the skirt is cut
in four sections with panel seams at the side, front and back.</p>

Line (Fig. 157)</h3>
<p>The &quot;cowl&quot; neck line is always a fashionable addition to an
evening dress, and is very flattering to every type of figure. There are a
variety of &quot;cowl&quot; neck lines, e.g. plain, high, or draped to one
side.</p>
<p>For the example given a plain, deep &quot;cowl&quot; is chosen, emanating
from a high curving waist seam. The back of the dress has a novel treatment
with a centre strap from a band round the back neck, while the sides of the
bodice at the back are cut away from under the arms. The waist is confined to
the figure by darts back and front, while the skirt is flared widely from a
seam running from the centre front to a low point at the centre back.</p>

<p>Cut round the front skirt section from 69 to 71 and from 71 to 19 at the
hem line, thence to 12 and back to 69 in Fig. 157. Cut through the lines from
E to A, F to B, G to C and H to D and, by pivoting from points A, B, C, and
D, insert 2 inches of extra width at each of the manipulation lines. Add 2
inches of spring at the sideseam from 19 to 19A from 71 as shown in Fig. 158.
Re-mark round the reconstructed pattern from 69 to 71 and from 12 to 19A. If
an even flare is desired in the skirt, the seam from 69 to 71 should assume a
gradual curve, but, if the skirt is required to hang in definite points of
flare, the seam between the above points should be drafted in a series of
angles instead of an even curve, and then the skirt will show flare at each
of these points only.</p>
<p>Cut out the back skirt section from 72 to 73 and X to 18 in Fig. 157. Cut
through the lines from R to M, P to L, O to K and N to J and insert 2 inches
of extra width at each of the manipulation lines at the hem line as in Fig.
158. Re-mark round the outline of the reconstructed skirt pattern and add 2
inches of sideseam spring from 72 and 18 to 18A.</p>
<p>Skirt flares of this character should always be cut on the direct bias of

the material to ensure their even &quot;hang&quot; or &quot;drape.&quot; The
straight edge from 12 to 69 should be placed to the fold of the bias edge.
Similarly, from 73 to X is placed to the bias fold when cutting out.</p>

Sleeves (Fig. 159)</h3>
<p>Fig. 159 shows an evening-cum-dinner dress that can be worn on any formal
or informal occasion. The sleeves make it adaptable for use for cinema wear
without being out of place.</p>
<p>The bodice of the dress has buttons down the front from the neck opening
to waist and is fitted very closely to the figure. This accentuates the
appearance of the very fully flared and panelled skirt. The skirt is cut with
six gores so that a close fit is retained over the hip line in contrast to
the very full hem.</p>
<p>The sleeves are short (or may be full length) and pleated into the
shoulder. It is advisable to keep the shoulder seam on the narrow side so
that the sleeves stand well up from the shoulders and accentuate their square
appearance.</p>
<p>Measurements for the draft are as follows&#8212;</p>

Treatment of Uneven Skirt Design (Fig. 161)</h3>
<p>The dress depicted by Fig. 161 illustrates the drafting of patterns to
designs when the line is not the same each side of the skirt and bodice. It
is necessary to trace off from the draft a duplicate side and mark the design
on the whole back or front.</p>
<p>The design illustrated has many points of style worthy of close attention.
The centre seam of the fronts develops into a very high &quot;cowl&quot; neck
line at the base of the throat, while at the hem it is slit up a distance of
14 inches for a split-skirt effect. At the back across the shoulders the
front &quot;cowl&quot; becomes a shoulder capelet, fastening with three
buttons and holes.</p>
<p>The skirt design shows a seam running from each sideseam to cross at the
natural waist and overlap in the manner indicated, diverging back to the
centre of the skirt and forming a low flare to the hem line. Panel seams
traverse the front skirt from the side-seams above the waist to the centre,
thence flare down towards the hem line from the knee level.</p>
<p>Measurements for the draft are as follows&#8212;</p>
	<ul class="small">

	<li>Bust = 36 inches.</li>

becomes more difficult. A variation of the usual procedure takes place, and
we reduce as much as possible of the suppression by closing out in the lines

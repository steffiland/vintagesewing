  </p>
  <p>    IN recent years the raglan coat style has found great favour with designers
    and the public generally. No longer does the mention of a &quot;raglan&quot; bring
    to mind a garment of rain-proof style and stereotyped design cut on loose-fitting
    lines; instead, to-day an entirely different outlook is held.</p><p>
    Raglans are now made with line and style; the sleeve is inserted for its
    value in design rather than for utility. Another innovation is the use of
    raglan sleeves with other than loose-fitting styles, for looked upon as having
    design value they may be adapted to either close- or loose-fitting garments.</p><p>
    There seems to be an atmosphere of difficulty surrounding the cutting of
    raglan sleeves. Admittedly, the variations of these sleeves, which are required
    without a seam over the shoulder, present difficulties which can be met only
    by a compromise. The material used also must be considered; a close weave
    gives less to the shoulder than a looser texture, and adjustment in the sleeve
    must be made accordingly.</p>
    <p>
    The principal point to keep in mind is the position of the shoulder seam.
    For raglans and all garments of this character, including split-sleeve and
    drop-shoulder designs, the seam must be exactly on the top of the shoulder.
    Loose-fitting garments are intended to hang from the shoulders as an essential
    feature of their design, and the effect of the design is ruined if the shoulder
    seam slopes back over the shoulder to give an impression of falling-away
    from the figure. With raglan sleeves the location of the shoulder seam right
    in the centre of the shoulder enables the raglan seam runs to be balanced
    equally each side. Too often we see raglan coats with creases from the back
    to the front shoulder caused by the retention of a similar back neck width
    to a chesterfield style with the result that all the seams are placed too
    far back from the front. Another point to note is the necessity of easing-in
    the back shoulder seam to the forepart seam. While this operation may be
      faithfully carried out when making set-in sleeve shoulders, it is often
      neglected
      in the making of raglans. Obviously, what is correct and necessary for
      one
    style applies with equal force to the other. A lot of the trouble experienced
    with raglan sleeves and shoulders is caused by this small factor. Failure
    to ease the shoulder to the front does not help in the need for spring over
    the shoulder point in front, over which, in raglans, there always seems to
    be tightness.</p>
    <p>
    The draft basis as described hitherto provides for the shoulder seam on the
    top of the shoulder at the scye; it is therefore necessary to adjust this
    seam at the neck further towards the front. The adjustment required is &frac12;
    inch, and, in this book, drafts embodying raglan, drop-shoulder or split-sleeves
    will be described with the necessary adjustment made.</p>

(Fig. 54)</h3>
  <p> For the purpose of clarity the system will be described for the
    shoulder
    construction in full as usually drafted, and then the variation superimposed
    thereon.</p>
  <p> The draft is based upon the normal 34-inch bust standard, scale 17 inches.</p>
  <p>To
    draft&#8212;</p>
  <p>Commence by drawing line X to 2, the length to the natural waist.</p>
    <ul class="small">
      <li>
      1 from X = the back depth = one-third of the scale
    plus 1&frac34; inches.</li>
      <li> 2 from X = the waist length from X.</li>
      <li> 3 from X = one-sixth of the scale less &frac14; inch. </li>
      <li>Square up from 3
      to 4 1 inch.</li>
      <li> Shape from 4 to X for the back neck curve as shown.</li>
      <li> 5 from 1 = the half-back width plus &frac14; inch. </li>
      <li>Square up from 5 to
      6 as indicated.</li>
      <li> 7 from 1 = half the bust measure plus 2 inches. </li>
      <li>Square up from 7
      to 8 equal to X to 1 at the back.</li>
      <li> 9 from 8 = one-twelfth of the scale.</li>
      <li> 10 and 9 = one-sixth of the scale.</li>
      <li> 11 from 7 = half the scale less &frac34; inch.</li>
      <li> 12 from 11 = one-sixth of the scale.</li>
      <li> Square up from 12 to 13 equal to 7 to 9 less &frac12; inch.</li>
      <li> 14 is midway of 5 to 11 for the position of the sideseams 
    and shoulder slope determination point. </li>
      <li>Square from 14 up to 15 one-third
      of the scale plus &frac14; inch.</li>
      <li> Square down from 14 to 16. </li>
      <li>Join 15 to 4 and
      13.</li>
      <li> 17 is located where the line from 15 to 4 is intersected by
    the line from 5 to 6.</li>
      <li> 18 from 17 = &frac12; inch. Shape the back shoulder seam
    run from 18 to 4 as indicated.</li>
      <li> 19 from 13 = 4 to 18 less &frac12; inch.</li>
      <li> 20 and 21 are each &frac12; inch below the breast line for the
    base of the scye. This quantity is used when the raglan design is intended
    to be cut fairly close up. </li>
      <li>Square down from 7 to 22 at the front centre line.</li>
      <li> 23 from 9 = one-sixth of the scale.</li>
      <li> Shape the neck curve as shown from 23 to 10.</li>
      <li> 24 is midway of 11 to 7.</li>
      <li> 25 from 13 = 13 to 10 pivoted from 24.</li>
      <li>Shape the bust dart from 24 to 13 and 25 as indicated.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    The variation from the normal draft is as follows&#8212;</p>
    <ul class="small">
      <li>
      Continue the back neck curve &frac12; inch from 4 to 26. </li>
      <li>Square down from 26
      to 27.</li>
      <li> 27 from X = one-sixth of the scale net for the difference
    of construction.</li>
      <li> Shape the back shoulder seam from 26 to point 18. </li>
      <li>At the front shoulder,
      28 is lowered the same quantity below 10 that 26 is raised above 4.</li>
      <li> 29 from 13 = 3/8 inch, or the extent of the variation of the
    back shoulder seam at this point.</li>
      <li> 30 from 29 = 29 to 28 pivoted from 24.</li>
      <li> Reshape the front shoulder seam from 28 to 29 and from 30 to 19 to
        complete the variation of the shoulder seams.</li>
    </ul>

  <p> There are many positions for the raglan seams on the shoulder, all of which
    are a matter of style and do not interfere with the basic constructional
    method as presented herewith. From the point of view of style, it is always
    advisable to keep the seam runs fairly high on the shoulders to obviate the
    tendency of this style to give a sloping-shoulder appearance. Quite often,
    however, fashion decrees a sloping-shoulder
    silhouette at one season and a square effect the next, and it is up to the
    designer to keep <em>au fait</em> with the current mode.</p>
  <p>
    From the making point of view, it is essential that the raglan seams at the
    neck do not converge to practically nothing. It does not give either the
    cutter or the tailor much chance of success if there is not sufficient distance
    between the two horns of the sleeve to permit ease of sewing-out. The author
    believes in allowing for the horns of the sleeve to be each &frac12; inch wide
      at the collar seam; in addition to ease of making, an improved appearance
      is thereby gained.
    It has also been found from experience that a raglan coat does not require
    a back width in proportion to the normal apart from any variation of seam
    placement.</p>
  <p>
    To make the variation for the raglan seam runs proceed as follows&#8212;</p>
  <ul class="small">
    <li>
      Points X to 30 are as described in Fig. 54, with the
    exception that the constructional lines of the
    normal shoulders are omitted.</li>
    <li> Therefore 9 from 8 = one-twelfth of the scale less &frac12; inch.</li>
    <li><em> A</em> is the
        front sleeve pitch, &frac34; inch up from the base of the
    scye line at 20.</li>
    <li><em> B</em> is the back pitch, half X to 1 up from point 5. </li>
    <li>To draft
        the back raglan seam run, mark back to 31 from
    26&frac12; inch, the width of the sleeve horn at the
    collar seam.</li>
    <li> 32 from the back pitch <em>B</em> = 3/8 inch. </li>
    <li>Join 32 to 31 by a construction
      line.</li>
    <li> Shape the seam run from 32 to 31 as shown, adding &frac12; inch of curve
    between the two points.</li>
    <li> Continue the seam run from 32 to finish at the back scye 1&frac12; inches
    below pitch<em> B</em>.</li>
    <li> At the front shoulder 33 is &frac12; inch below 29 for the sleeve-horn width.</li>
    <li> Join the constructional line from 33 to the front pitch <em>A</em> as
    shown.</li>
    <li> Shape the seam run between these points, adding &frac34; inch of curve.
      <ul>
        <li> The bust dart has now to be taken into account. To mark the complete
          seam run to terminate at the front-neck point, 35 from 29 equals the
          distance from 34 to 30.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li> 36 from 30 = 37 from 29.</li>
    <li> 38 from 28 = the distance 33 is below 29.</li>
    <li> Shape the seam run from 38 to 35, and when the bust dart is sewn out
    38, 35 and 34 to the front pitch will be one seam.
      <ul>
        <li> If the garment is cut with a gorge or underarm seam dart, the raglan
          seam run will be as marked from the front pitch to 33, except, of course,
          that
          the height of 33 from the breast line will be automatically increased
          by the working out of the different systems.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This completes the shaping of the raglan seams on the shoulders.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><a name="shoulder" id="shoulder"></a><em><a href="illust/056.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,508);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/056-t.jpg" alt="Figure 56" width="158" height="195" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig56" id="fig56"></a>The Shoulder Sections (Fig. 56)</h3>
  <p> Fig. 56 indicates the shoulder sections cut away from the pattern and ready
    to be superimposed upon the normal sleeve draft. In the author's opinion,
    the most accurate method of cutting raglan sleeves is to cut the shoulder
    sections away and lay them
    upon the sleeve draft to obtain the shape of the horns. Many cutters use
    this method in practice in preference to the principle of obtaining the factors
    of construction by measuring the lengths of the raglan seams and transposing
    them upon the sleeve draft by sweeps and pivoting. The latter method may
    be quicker in practice, so it is advisable first to understand thoroughly
    the method of superimposing the shoulder sections on the sleeve, and then
    evolve a system to give equal results without the necessity of always cutting
    away the shoulder parts.</p>
  <p>
    Fig. 56 also shows how the two sections of the front shoulder appear when
    the dart has been closed.</p><p>
    Now with regard to the seams to be allowed and accounted for, the back shoulder
    seam run is now the shape of the raglan seam run 31 to 32 and C, and has
    a seam allowed for in the construction of the system. Therefore, no seams
    are allowed round the shoulder section at 26 to 18 and 31 to 32 and C.</p><p>
    Similarly, at the front shoulder a seam is allowed from 38 to 35 and 34 to
    the front pitch A and all round the scye. Seams are required from 19 to 28
    and from 38 to 35 and A on the shoulder section.</p><p>
    The two lower diagrams indicate how the seams are added to the cut-away shoulder
    sections.</p>
    <h3 class="clear"><a name="prelim" id="prelim"></a><em><a href="illust/057.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,466);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/057-t.jpg" alt="Figure 57" width="149" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig57" id="fig57"></a>Preliminary Sleeve Construction (Fig. 57
    (a))</h3>
  <p> Fig. 57 (a) illustrates the method adopted of superimposing the shoulder
    sections upon a normal sleeve draft. For raglan sleeves, it is advisable
    to cut them slightly wider than set-in sleeves from the point of view of
    ease in wear.</p>
  <p>
    For the purpose of the draft, the necessary scye measures are derived from
    the shoulder section of Fig. 55.</p>
    <ul class="small">
      <li>
      Total scye circumference = 16&frac12; inches.</li>
      <li> Top-scye circumference = 9 inches.</li>
      <li> Under-scye circumference = 7&frac12; inches.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    To draft&#8212;</p>
    <p>Square from X.</p>
    <ul class="small">
      <li>
      1 from X = the height of the back pitch from the base
    of the scye line less &frac12; inch.</li>
      <li> 2 from 1 = the top-scye circumference applied diagonally.</li>
      <li> 3 from 2 = one-third of the diagonal measure 1 to 2
    plus &frac12; inch.</li>
      <li> 4 from 3 = the crown height, 1&frac12; inches, as may be
    found by sweeping from a &frac14; inch seam below the back and front shoulder
        ends and where these sweeps intersect to the level of the back pitch
        from the
    breast line.</li>
      <li> 5 is midway of 3 to X. Shape the sleeve crown as shown
    from 1 to 5, 4 and 2.</li>
      <li> 6 from 2 diagonally = the required sleeve length less
    the half-width of the back. </li>
      <li>8 from 6 = 1 &frac14; inches. </li>
      <li>Square out from 7 to 8
      and 9.</li>
      <li> 8 from 7 = &frac34; inch. Join 8 to 1.</li>
      <li> 9 from 8 = one-third of the total scye circumference net. </li>
      <li>Join 9 through
      6 to locate point 10.</li>
      <li> 11 for the position of the elbow is midway 1 to 10.</li>
      <li> 12 from 11 = 1&frac14; inches always.</li>
      <li> Join 2 to 9 to locate point 13 on the line squared up from 11.</li>
      <li> 14 from 13 = 2 inches. Shape from 14 to 9 for provisional sleeve construction.</li>
      <li> Add &frac34; inch to the top-sleeve at 15, 16 and 17 for the three-quarter
      sleeve finish.
        <ul>
          <li> It is always advisable to cut all raglan sleeves in this way,
            so that the seam is well out of sight tinder the arm. Take the front
            shoulder
            section
          before the seams have been added and place in position upon the sleeve
            crown.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>18 from 1 on the diagonal line 1 to 2 is a &frac14; inch seam, for, as
        a seam is allowed round the scye at this section, there is only the need
        for one seam
    to be allowed at 18 on the shoulder section. Overlap the shoulder section
    below the sleeve crown &frac12; inch or two seams at 19. The reason for this is
    that there is not an over-shoulder sleeve seam in a raglan and the shoulder
    and sleeve are cut in one piece.
        <ul>
          <li> After the shoulder section has been superimposed upon the sleeve,
          mark the seams to be allowed as shown by the solid lines.</li>

  <p>    A smart loose-fitting raglan is shown in Fig. 58. Loose-fitting designs
    have had a new lease of popularity and are very suited to the modern woman.
    A full skirt is usually cut when the coat is worn without a belt, and a variation
    of style may be introduced by the &quot;swing&quot; or &quot;box&quot; back
    effect.</p>
  <p>
    The author always endeavours, when cutting loose-fitting styles, to have
    the front sideseam running backwards from under the arm; in other words,
    to allow more &quot;spring&quot; on the front sideseam than on the back.
    The effect so obtained is much more stylish than the reverse and contributes
    to the loose, swinging appearance desired.</p>
  <p>
    The fronts are fastened with three buttons, and a &quot;Prussian&quot; collar
    finishes the neck. Novel pockets are indicated, consisting of a sewn-on patch
    with a jeatted pocket inset.</p>
  <p>
    Full-length coats do not look fashionable in loose-fitting styles; the latter
    should be worn either seven-eighths or three-quarter length.</p><p>
    Full measures for the draft are as follows&#8212;</p>

  <p>    Fig. 59 shows how to infuse extra width or &quot;drapery&quot; in the skirt
    of a loose-fitting garment. The &quot;swing&quot; or &quot;box&quot; back
    is achieved by splitting up the pattern from a point vertically below the
    back pitch C and opening out approximately 2 to 4 inches at the bottom edge.
    If the extra width is not required at the sideseams under the arms the author
    reduces at this part half the amount let in for the &quot;box&quot; effect.</p><p>
    Care must be taken that the back sideseam does not run forward after the
    adjustment has been made. The author checks this up by laying the pattern
    in the &quot;square&quot; after recutting and, if necessary, reduces the
    back seam and adds this quantity to the front sideseam.</p><p>
    For style the author has often added front drape when cutting this type of &quot;swagger&quot; coat.
    In fact, these days loose-fitting garments possess a <em>chic</em> of their own that
    to the older generation is inexplicable. To them a raglan is just another
    loose coat and easy to cut, yet therein lies the snag. What is apparently
    easy to cut must have &quot;line&quot; of some sort infused therein to give
    style to such a straightforward design, and style features, like &quot;swing&quot; backs
    and draped fronts, are a boon to the cutter of intuition. The fronts are
    opened up from a point 3 inches up from the front pitch vertically to the
    bottom edge, and approximately the same amount is inserted as at the back.</p>

  </ul>
  <p>
    When shaping the shoulder seams down the centre of the sleeve, make sure
    that the width of the sleeve is not reduced below point 4 by overlapping
    the sleeve seams too low, for with a raglan sleeve the fullness that is usually
    infused into the sleeve for a set-in style is necessarily eliminated, but
    there is still the need for the same width of sleeve over the muscle.</p>

  <p> Fig. 63 illustrates the draft of a one-piece raglan sleeve with a dart
    shoulder and a plain hindarm without a wrist dart. This type of sleeve is
    generally
    utilized for weatherproof coats and is preferable to the sleeve which is
    absolutely plain in construction without either a shoulder dart or overshoulder
    seams. It is impossible to cut a satisfactory raglan sleeve without provision
    for the shape of the shoulder by means of a dart or overshoulder seams; the
    plain-shoulder sleeve type always has a tendency to drag on the shoulder
    point in wear.</p><p>

    <h3><a name="deep" id="deep"></a>The Deep-scye Raglan Sleeve</h3>
  <p>    At the moment designers are featuring to a great extent the deep-scye sleeve
    in either raglan or magyar form. In addition to its use in conjunction with
    loose-fitting styles, it is also extensively used in close-fitting garments
    as a means of providing width and fullness about the shoulders in comparison
    with a slender waist and hip line.</p><p>
    From the point of view of style, this type of sleeve is being recognized
    as a decided asset to the &quot;sporty&quot; type of coat worn by the younger
    generation and is entirely divorced from its original purpose, that of a
    sleeve only suitable for sacque slip-on rain-proofs.</p><p>
    The draped effects of &quot;dressy&quot; coats also lend themselves to harmonizing
    with this type of sleeve, for a certain amount of fullness is always met
    with in construction owing to the need for allowing for freedom of movement.
    If the sleeve were cut to present an absolutely clean appearance at the front
    and back scye when the arm is down, it would be impossible to lift the arm
    without discomfort being felt; so that when this sleeve is being drafted
    provision must be made for freedom of movement, and to attain this end the
    sleeve is so constructed that what amounts to a &quot;gusset&quot; is added
    to the under-sleeve.</p>

  <p>    Fig. 65 shows the alteration made to the basis draft for a deep-scye
    raglan style. It is necessary to say that the scye should not be deepened
    too extremely
    in view of the impaired freedom of movement to the sleeve; at the most an
    increase in depth of 3&frac12; inches from the breast line is allowable. The
    basis draft illustrated by Fig. 65 shows the sideseam construction of a loose-fitting
    garment and to this end is extended to the hip level. For the purpose of
    the system, the basis draft is arranged upon a 36-inch bust girth, a half-back
    width of 6&frac34; inches, and hip girth of 40 inches, while the working scale
    equals one-third of the bust girth plus 6 inches.</p>

  <p>    The shape of the scye of deep-scye raglans does not permit a sleeve to be
    cut on three-piece lines as a top- and under-sleeve with an overshoulder
    seam, except in the case of a pivot sleeve. Instead, all deep-scye sleeves
    are constructed from the standard one-piece sleeve basis to permit the shape
    of the under-scye seams of the body part to be incorporated with the sleeve
    draft in similar seam runs.</p><p>
    If the sleeve is drafted as deep as the scye of the coat, the freedom of
    movement in the sleeve will be seriously curtailed. To overcome this and
    to provide a maximum of ease commensurate with the style of garment, the
    sleeve base construction is lowered from the breast line by only half the
    actual deepening of the scye.</p><p>
    The scye measures for the construction of the basis deep-scye sleeve draft

    to the Scye Depth (Fig. 67)</h3>
  <p> Fig. 67 illustrates clearly the comparative relationship
    between the depth
    of the coat scye and the sleeve.</p>
  <p>
    The deep-scye sleeve as drafted in Fig. 66 is superimposed upon the raglan
    basis draft in the position where the shoulder seams sew together at the
    pitches. Square each way from 45 and 46 to 8A and 7A. Measure the distance
    from the front pitch A to the sideseam at 46 and sweep from 46 to 7A. Mark
    from 7A to the front pitch A. Measure from the back pitch at 42 round the
    under-scye to 45 and sweep this quantity to locate point 8A. Shape from 42
    to 8A. This sleeve draft shows the depth of the sleeve base corresponding
    with the scye base. No provision for freedom of movement is made.</p>
  <p>
    The sleeve as drafted in Fig. 66 is indicated by the solid lines to 7 and
    8, showing an addition of 1 &frac34; inches in length of the under-sleeve seam
      for ease of movement. The base of the sleeve is now located at half the
      total
    depth of the scye from the front pitch.</p>
  <p>
    For additional length the base of the sleeve may be raised to run through
    the level of the pitch A; 7B is pivoted from A and 46 as indicated; 8B
    is pivoted from 45 and 42. An increase of length in the under-sleeve seam
    equivalent to the actual quantity the scye has been deepened is now apparent.
    We could continue practically indefinitely with the raising of the sleeve
    base line until we had a pivot sleeve with unlimited freedom of movement
    and unlimited creases and folds of surplus material too!</p>
  <p>
    Therefore, when drafting sleeves for deep-scye coats the first essential
    is provision for movement, and, secondly, a sleeve that is reasonably free
    from unsightly folds of material under the arm. The sleeve base at half the
    total depth the scye has been previously lowered gives a reasonable amount
    of satisfaction to both of the two requirements. For a coat with a close
    fit at the waist, freedom in the sleeve is imperative, otherwise the coat
    will be dragged out of position from the waist with every movement of the
    arms, and the sleeve base may be judiciously raised to one-fourth of the
    amount the scye has been lowered.</p>

  <p> The following system is useful as a means of showing the raglan system
    in practice, and also as an example of raglan shoulder design that does not
    follow the stereotyped lines and seams. The design selected for the purpose
    of the draft has fronts that just meet, a scarf collar at the neck and a &quot;swing&quot; back
    influence in the skirt.</p><p>
    Instead of the raglan shoulder seams running to their usual positions, at
    the front the seam runs horizontally across the shoulder from just above
    the neck opening to curve with a sharp angle into the scye. The back raglan
    seam forms a yoke across the back shoulder instead of terminating at the
    neck. A slightly deeper scye is included in the design, and the sleeve is
    a two-piece type with over-shoulder seams terminating in a strapping fastened
    with three buttons.</p><p>

    Fig. 71 shows the drafting of the sleeve to agree with the scye and shoulders
    illustrated in Fig. 70. For the purpose of simplicity the shoulder sections
    are superimposed upon the sleeve draft to show the constructional methods
      adopted. Seams have to be allowed round the shoulders where the seams cut
      across; the original shoulder seams retain their seam
    allowances as in a set-in shoulder coat. Seams are also allowed on the body
    part from 43 to 44 and 45 to A, and from 41 to 42 and C in Fig. 70.</p>

    below 15 in Fig. 70.</li>
      <li> 3 from 1 diagonally = the top-scye circumference
    between the pitches A and B in Fig. 70.</li>

      <li> Measure round the scye from A to the shoulder end at 19 in Fig. 70
        and apply this quantity round the sleeve crown from 1 to 15 plus &frac12;

    from 11 to 15 and 4 to 19, 22, 21 and 20, marking out the strapping 1&frac12;

    </ul>
    <p>
    When cutting this sleeve from the material, it will be seen that, if the
    back yoke is cut on the fold of the material, the sleeve will be running
    across the grain. In some fabrics this would look very smart and effective.
    An alternative method is to cut the sleeve down the &quot;straight&quot; of
    the grain and have the back running across. Either way is correct; the governing
    factor is, of course, the design
    of the material, whether pronounced or plain in pattern.</p>
    <h3><a name="noseam" id="noseam"></a>Construction of a Raglan Sleeve to Eliminate the Shoulder Seam Construction</h3>
  <p>    The only raglan sleeve remaining to be dealt with is the one- or two-piece
    type in which there is neither over-shoulder seams nor a dart to provide
    the necessary shoulder form. In the construction of this sleeve, cutters
    are
    faced with perhaps
    the greatest difficulty of all in the cutting of raglans, for this sleeve
    from the designing point of view is comparable with attempting adequately
    to achieve and cover the shape of the bust prominence with a piece of perfectly
    flat material without darts of any description.</p>
  <p>
    We have to do this same thing, i.e. cover a prominence with a flat piece
    of material possessing no contour shape to agree with the prominence to be
    covered and provide for freedom and movement in addition. Look at any of
    the one-piece raglan sleeves in wear; they all appear to be tight over the
    shoulder bone and have an excess of material under the arm because, as the
      shoulder point endeavours to take up material for covering, the whole sleeve
      is dragged up with it. A compromise of fit is all that can
    be hoped for as the design of sleeve is fundamentally impracticable and opposed
    to all logical cutting principles. Some degree of fit is approachable if
    the material is of pliable texture and amenable to manipulation, but, more
    often than not, the sleeve is required in a rain-proofed coating and manipulation
    is impossible.</p>
  <p>
    The fundamental principle to keep in mind is that there must be no reduction
    of length over the shoulder as defined by the over-shoulder seam sleeve construction,
    and the width of the sleeve over the biceps must remain constant.</p>

    (Fig. 72)</h3>
  <p> Illustrated in Fig. 72 are the sections of a normal shoulder laid
    in position
    on the sleeve head constructed upon standard basis lines. The front shoulder
    section is lettered from A to D and overlaps the sleeve head one seam at
    1 and two seams at 6. The back shoulder section is lettered from E to J
    and overlaps the sleeve crown two seams from 2 to H and E to 7.</p>
  <h3><a name="second" id="second"></a><a name="fig73" id="fig73"></a>Second Stage in Sleeve Construction (Fig. 73)</h3>
  <p class="clear">    Fig. 73 <em><a href="illust/073.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,428);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/073-t.jpg" alt="Figure 73" width="136" height="183" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>shows
    the effect of endeavouring to eliminate the shoulder seam to achieve a plain
    shoulder. Assuming that A to C is the correct length of
    the
    front raglan shoulder seam, the seam of the sleeve must agree with this distance,
    and similarly the back shoulder seam from 2 to G should remain equal to the
    length of the two-piece shoulder when a plain shoulder construction is required.
    Now, seemingly, if we pivot from a seam below D with the point
    of radius 1, and from a seam behind F, pivoting from 2, where these two
    arcs intersect will give the shape of the shoulder section without a dart
    or over-shoulder
    seam. Two seams are eliminated in the plain shoulder construction at D and
    F, and if the two shoulder sections are pivoted to agree with the movement
    of the arc radii it is seen that two seams are lost through the overlapping
    of the shoulders. At the shoulder end, the overlapping is greater in extent,
    and in consequence of the elimination of the centre seam from D to B and
    E to F there is a shortness of length of 1&frac12; inches from B to D and E
    to F. A loss of 1 inch of width over the crown is noted from M to M<span class="small">1</span> after
    reckoning
    has been made of the two seams eliminated in the centre of the shoulder.
    Here we have the cause of trouble with this sleeve, the failure to retain
    an identical quantity of length over the shoulder
    as definitely decided by the standard normal sleeve basis construction. In
    addition, there is a loss of width through the sleeve over the muscle.</p>
  <p>
    Obviously length needed in one type of sleeve construction cannot be taken
    away without affecting the balance, and the problem is to retain this same
    length in the construction of the plain raglan shoulder.</p><p>
    The only solution of the problem is indicated by Fig. 74, and even this is
    dependent on the suitability of the material for purposes of manipulation.</p>

  <p>    The sleeve head is first drafted in the usual way and the raglan shoulder
    sections superimposed thereupon as indicated in the basis draft.</p><p>
    Join F to D and locate the exact centre of the connecting line.</p>
    <p>
    Draw a line from point 3 through the centre point 6, and then, pivoting from
    2, sweep an arc from 6 to 7 equal to the distance F to G on the sleeve horn.
    Mark from 6 to 8 equal to the quantity D to C; 9 from 8 equals the seam of
    the sleeve as added on from C. Point M remains in the same location as for
    the two-piece shoulder construction. Join M to 9 and add &frac14; inch of
    curve to the seam between these points. Sweep the distance from 1 to C to
    intersect the construction line from M to 9 at point 10. From 10 to 9 indicates
    the quantity that is required to be drawn-in by a thread pressed towards
    the centre of the shoulder; this drawing-in takes place from point M upwards
    for a distance of 3 to 4 inches. Join 7 to B and hollow the seam &frac14; inch.
    Take the distance from 2 to G and sweep an arc to intersect the construction
    line from B to 7 at 11. The distance from 7 to 11 indicates the amount to
    be drawn-in and pressed towards the centre of the shoulder. This drawing-in
    takes place for a matter of 3 inches from 1&frac12; inches above B. It is
    impossible to achieve a measure of success with this type of sleeve unless
    the manipulation as described is infused, and so, if the material used lacks
    pliability and manipulative quality, the author does not believe in using
    a sleeve of this design.</p>

  <h3><a name="split" id="split"></a>Constructional Basis for Split-sleeve Designs</h3>
  <p>    When constructing patterns for split-sleeve designs, the shoulder construction
    remains identical with the raglan construction. For this reason split-sleeve
    designs may be classed as of raglan character and systematized in conjunction.</p><p>
    Cutting systems often make the error of endeavouring to eliminate the fullness
    that is eased into the scye with a set-in sleeve by using the centre seam
    of the split-sleeve as a means of reducing sleeve head fullness. To the author's
    mind this is incorrect, for easing the sleeve into the scye gives a good-hanging
    sleeve and also provides the required extra width over the shoulder prominence.
    If this fullness is eliminated, a flat-looking appearance to the sleeve results,
    with discomfort and restriction of the movements of the arm. Another point
    is the risk of the shoulder and sleeve seams failing to run in one continuous
    line if there is not sufficient fullness in the sleeve head to permit of
    adjustment.</p><p>
    The split-sleeve shares with the raglan a wide measure of popularity at the
    present time, and may be adapted either to close-fitting &quot;dressy&quot; styles
    or to loose-fitting garments.</p><p>
    The sleeve is drafted in the same way as the standard basis system for a
    set-in sleeve, and the alteration for the centre seam is superimposed upon
    the construction as a style seam.</p>

    <p>
    Additional variation of design in the sleeve does not affect the basis method
    of drafting the sleeve, for all variations are supplementary to the system
    and, as such, are derived from a common basis.</p>
    <h3><a name="dropline" id="dropline"></a>The Drop-shoulder Line Designs</h3>
  <p> Yet another fashion that may be classed with raglan styles is the new &quot;drop-shoulder
    line&quot; design. As the name implies, the shoulder seam is lowered from
    the normal position on the shoulder to down over the arm, and the additional
    shoulder is taken from the sleeve. Sloping-shoulder effects for style purposes
    are derived from this type of shoulder seam placement, as the shoulder seam
    where the sleeve is sewn may be diverted at will on the sleeve to give either
    square or sloping lines.</p><p>
    When designing patterns for this style of coat the first act is to determine
    the position of the shoulder seam on the shoulder of the coat. By &quot;shoulder
    seam&quot; in this instance is not meant the normal shoulder seam placed
    in the centre of the shoulder, but the additional seams across the shoulder
    sections of the coat, back and front, that carry the drop-shoulder line over
    the sleeve and form the shoulder and sleeve in one whole piece.</p><p>
    After the position of the seamings on the back and front shoulders have been
    decided, the next operation is to draft a normal basis sleeve to the design.
    Then lay the shoulders of the coat in position on the sleeve as previously
    described for a raglan, overlapping the two seams that are eliminated by
    cutting the shoulder and sleeve whole and marking the drop-shoulder design
    on the sleeve.</p><p>
    Much can be learnt in the cutting of these designs by studying actual examples.</p>
    <h3 class="clear"><a name="loosedrop" id="loosedrop"></a><em><a href="illust/081.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,331);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/081-t.jpg" alt="Figure 81" width="104" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig81" id="fig81"></a>Loose-fitting Coat with a Drop-shoulder Effect (Fig. 81)</h3>
  <p>    Illustrated by Fig. 81 is a typical example of a loose coat with &quot;drop-shoulder&quot; influence.
    At the front shoulder, a yoke runs from the centre front to the scye, and
    continues over the sleeve and across the back to form a back-shoulder yoke.
    The yoke forms a tab with a hole-and-button fastening at the neck, with either
    a scarf or stand collar.</p>
  <p>
    This is a very simple design and will show clearly the evolution of the &quot;drop-shoulder
    line&quot; in practice. For all designs of this character, the shoulder seam
    is placed in the same centre shoulder position as for raglans and split-sleeve
    coat.</p>

    The back yoke may now be cut away from the body part in preparation for drafting
    the continuation of the shoulder line upon the sleeve.</p><p>
    The front yoke is not cut away from the body part at present until the position
    of the shoulder in relation to the sleeve is decided.</p><p>
    Where the yoke runs across the back and front shoulders, a seam has to be
    allowed on each side of the division.</p>

  <p> Fig. 82 shows the sleeve head of a two-piece standard sleeve for the purpose
    of illustrating the principles adapted for varying the shoulder line.</p>
  <p>
    The sleeve head is drafted in the usual manner with the hindarm seam lowered
    1&frac12; inches, though in this instance it would be quite correct to retain
      the seam in the standard two-piece sleeve position, in alignment with the
      back
    pitch.</p>
  <p>
    Take the forepart of the coat first and lay it into position on the sleeve
    head. The front pitch A overlaps the diagonal line from 1 to 2 to the extent
    of two seams or &frac12; inch, while at the shoulder end 20 overlaps the sleeve
    crown at 4 by the same quantity; 47 is also overlapping the sleeve head &frac12;
    inch, so that from 47 to A there are allowed two seams necessary for the
      sewing together of the remaining sleeve and scye sections.</p>
  <p>
    Next place the back yoke into position on the sleeve crown, overlapping two
    seams from 2 to B and two seams from 19 at the back shoulder end from the
    crown at 4.</p>
  <p>
    Mark the lowered shoulder line on the sleeve head by joining 47 to B and
    2 as shown by the dash line. Here we have a drop-shoulder line that runs
      horizontally over the arm from front to back. Complete the shape of the
      shoulder seams
      by drafting from
    the front shoulder point at 20 to the centre of the sleeve at C and from
    the back shoulder end 19 to the same point.</p>

  <p>    Fig. 83 depicts the addition of seams to the shoulder sections and the sleeve
    head where the yoke has been taken across.</p><p>
    This diagram is self-explanatory, but, in addition, it is necessary to remember
    to add seams to the body part of the shoulders from 42 to 46 and 47 and from
    B to 48 (Fig. 81).</p>
    <h3><a name="supplementdrop" id="supplementdrop"></a><a name="fig84" id="fig84"></a>Supplementary Examples of Drop-shoulder Design (Fig. 84)</h3>
  <p class="clear">    Figs. 84 (a) <em><a href="illust/084.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,414);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/084-t.jpg" alt="Figure 84" width="131" height="195" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>and 84 (b) show two additional examples of prevalent drop-shoulder
    design. The first diagram, Fig. 84 (a), illustrates a design with seams running
    from the scye at back and front in pointed motifs, which is repeated on the
    sleeve in a deep point
    to the elbow. With the position of the seaming on the front shoulder, the
    bust dart may be closed out and the shoulder section cut whole. The second
    diagram, Fig. 84 (b), illustrates a lowered shoulder line emanating from
    panel seams at back and front. The bust dart may be closed out as marked
    by the shading line, while from 13 to 14 the front panel takes the bust dart
    continuation.</p>
  <h3>    <a name="fig85" id="fig85"></a>Fig. 85</h3>
  <p class="clear">
    Fig. 85<em><a href="illust/085.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,331);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/085-t.jpg" alt="Figure 85" width="104" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em> illustrates the adapting of the shoulder sections of the first of
    the above two examples to produce the design of the drop shoulder on a standard
    sleeve basis.</p>
  <p>
    Place the front shoulder section upon the sleeve draft so that the front
      pitch A overlaps the diagonal line from 1 to 2 by a quantity of two seams,
      i.e. &frac12; inch. The shoulder end at 20 overlaps
    the sleeve head two seams at the front pitch.</p>
  <p>
    The back shoulder section is placed into position on the sleeve head in a
    similar manner to the front section, B from 2, and 19 from the sleeve crown,
    being overlapped by two seams. Mark down from 4 to E the required length
    of the pointed drop-shoulder line on the sleeve. In this instance, the author
    has made this distance 10 inches from 4, and the actual length is of minor
    importance apart from illustrating the system. Join D and C to E as shown.
    Mark the shoulder dart from 11 and 20 and from 5 and 19 to 3. If a seam is
      required from the shoulder to continue down the sleeve to E, two seams
      would need to be allowed by overlapping the centre seam as for
    a raglan sleeve draft. Allow a seam all round the shoulder section from the
    front yoke to D, continuing to E, C and round the back yoke as depicted by
    the shading. Allow a seam on the sleeve from G to E and F as shown to complete
    the construction.</p>
  <h3 class="clear">
    <em><a href="illust/086.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,452);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/086-t.jpg" alt="Figure 86" width="144" height="196" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig86" id="fig86"></a>Fig. 86</h3>
  <p>
    Fig. 86 shows how the second example is treated in construction on the sleeve.</p>
  <p>
    Place the front section upon the sleeve head, overlapping two seams from
    the front pitch A to 1 and at the shoulder end from 20 to the sleeve crown.</p>
  <p>
    Place the back upon the sleeve head in a similar manner, overlapping B from
    2 by two seams and 19 from the sleeve crown by the same quantity. Extend
    the shoulder lines from 14 and D to intersect the extension of 15 and B at
    point E. Shape from 19 and 20 to E. Cut away the drop-shoulder sections from
    the sleeve and add seams to the sleeve and shoulder sections as indicated
    by the shaded lines.</p>
  <p>
    There are many designs incorporating specimens of the drop-shoulder line
    that could be described,  but in all instances the method adopted
    of cutting them is identical with the system as previously described, and,
    consequently, no difficulty should be experienced in the interpretation of
      intricate designs if the fundamental principles of adapting the shoulder
      sections to the sleeve head and recutting
    are adhered to.</p>
    <p>
    With the many difficult designs cutters are called upon to produce these
    days, hard-and-fast rules of cutting are inadequate to meet all the demands
    of changing style, and for a successful career a large amount of courage,
      ingenuity and visualizing power is needed. We cannot always reduce everything
      to a
    scientific basis; if we could a lot of the interest in our job would be lost,
    there would be a superfluity of expert cutters and difficulties would be
      met and overcome with machine-like accuracy! But that time is not yet,
      and,
      personally, the author has manipulated
    and cut about patterns in a most unscientific manner if he is to be judged
    by textbook standards. However, the finished result is what he is more concerned
    with, not the copybook correctness or otherwise of the methods adopted to
    achieve it.</p>
    <p>
    It would be a well-nigh impossible task to attempt to illustrate every variation
    of fashion in systematic form, and, since every whim and fancy is derived
    or evolved from another source with something in common, the author is endeavouring
    to show a systematic method of approaching design with sufficient adaptability
    of constructional processes to cope with all demands of current and future
    fashion. To attempt a forecast of future fashion changes is not practical,
    but, whatever they are, cutters will always find a relationship with creations
    of the past.</p>

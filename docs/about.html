<h1><a name="maincont" id="maincont"></a>About VintageSewing.info</h1>
<p><img src="images/about.JPG" width="149" height="129" alt="silhouette of woman sitting and sewing" border="0" align="right" vspace="3" hspace="5" />.VintageSewing.info
  is the publishing site of the Vintage Sewing Reference Library, Inc. a nonprofit
  public benefit
  corporation which publishes public
  domain vintage sewing, fashion, and lifestyle books and images, rescuing primary
  source reference material from obscurity to freely share with anyone who searches
  for it. We especially want to provide this information to 
  recreationists and costumers so they can make design and construction choices
   from knowledge, not
ignorance.</p>
<h1>Origins of VintageSewing.info</h1>
<p>VintageSewing.info began in 1997 as a site on Geocities (a free &quot;homepage&quot;
  site) when our founder acquired her great-grandmother's sewing library. It
    was a tribute to Elsie Anna White
  (1901&#8211;1986),
  our founder's great grandmother,  a strong and capable woman who supported
  herself in the second half of her life using the sewing skills she had learned
  from many of the correspondence courses and books now published on this site.</p>
<p>Elsie White was the first born of fifteen children in a farming family in
  Northfield, Minnesota, and had to &quot;work in the fields like a man.&quot; She
  was married in 1921, had three daughters, and in the mid-1940's divorced her
  alcoholic
  husband and moved to California (where two of her daughters had also moved).
  She was employed at Golden Bear Sportswear in San Francisco, making tailored
  jackets from leathers, suedes, and wools, first
  as a stitcher, then as head stitcher, and became the &quot;problem fixer,&quot; the
  person who sorted out the sewing mistakes of other stitchers and helped keep
  the sewing machines running. She supplemented her income through millinery,
  custom dressmaking, and upholstery, was a skilled pattern drafter (her teen-aged
  granddaughter&#8212;our founder's mother&#8212;would show her a picture of
  a dress in a magazine, and she would draft the pattern and make the dress),
  and she had the ability to &quot;make
  it work&quot; even
  if there wasn't enough yardage. She continued to take sewing courses  and read
  sewing books until she retired at age 75.</p>
<h1>Milestones</h1>
<p>In 1998 we acquired the domain name &quot;VintageSewing.com&quot; and moved into the
  world of paid hosting, with no banner ads and no pop-up windows.</p>
<p>In March 2002, we acquired
    the newly created (and more appropriate) top-level domain of .info, and released
  .com.</p>
  <p> In March 2004, Vintage Sewing Reference Library became Vintage Sewing Reference 
    Library,&nbsp;Inc., as we upgraded from hobby to a separate legal entity, 
    incorporating as a nonprofit public benefit corporation (thus allowing us 
    to use the &quot;corporate we&quot; instead of the &quot;imperial we&quot;).

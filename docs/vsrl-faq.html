<h1><a name="maincont" id="maincont"></a>Frequently
  Asked Questions about our Decision to Incorporate</h1>
  <h3>Why incorporate at all? </h3>
  <p>We wanted
    to
    provide reassurance to our
    visitors
    that
    we were
    a stable
    and ongoing presence on the internet&#8212;a resource you could rely on.
    A hobby site can vanish on a whim. A corporation is a separate legal entity
    which exists independent of its directors or members. The legal steps involved
    in dissolving
    a corporation are more trouble than simply keeping on through a rough
    patch.</p>
  <h3>Why incorporate as a nonprofit? </h3>
  <p>By incorporating as a nonprofit public benefit corporation, we can register
    with the various states so we can <a href="support.html#money">solicit funds</a> from
    our visitors to help defray the costs of running this site. And once we receive
    our advance determination
  letter from the IRS, our generous donors will be able to take the contribution
    as a tax deduction.</p>
  <p> A nonprofit corporation is not organized for the private gain of any person.
    Any money you donate can be used only for the <a href="vsrl-art.html">stated
      purposes</a> of
    our corporation. The federal tax code
    prohibits
    us
    from
    paying
    dividends
    or profits to anyone. If we dissolve, we must distribute our assets to another
    tax-exempt nonprofit group. </p>
  <h3>Don't you want to make money off all this work?</h3>
  <p> Our founder adores the internet and having information about <em>everything
    you could imagine </em>freely available 24/7. VintageSewing.info is her way
    of adding to the pool of information. When pressed, she claims to find the
    whole process of converting books to html and maintaining this web site to
    be &quot;therapeutic.&quot;</p>
  <h3>Really, what do you get out of incorporating?</h3>
  <p>Aside from a lot of paperwork and bookkeeping? We get a formalized structure
    and an official legal status. We get to offer our visitors more ways to <a href="support.html">support
    this effort</a>. We have room to grow so we can rescue more primary source
    material from obscurity and share
    it with
    anyone who searches for it. Should we ever be sued, our directors are protected
    from personal liability. </p>

    video screen communication or other communications equipment (other than
    conference telephone) constitutes presence in person at that meeting if all

              by the board
              of directors in accordance with this section. The candidates receiving
              the highest number of votes up to the number of directors to be

    any two directors, and such meetings shall be held at the place, within or
        without the State of California, designated by the person or persons
    calling
        the meeting, and in the absence of such designation, at the principal
    office of the corporation.</p>
  <h3>SECTION 10. NOTICE OF MEETINGS</h3>
  <p> Regular meetings of the board may be held without notice. Special meetings
        of the board shall be held upon four (4) days' notice by first-class
    mail or forty-eight (48) hours' notice delivered personally or by telephone,
        telegraph, or email. If sent by mail or telegraph, the notice shall be
        deemed to be delivered on its deposit in the mails or on its delivery
    to
        the telegraph company. If sent by email, the notice shall be deemed to
        be delivered upon receipt of return message or telephone call from recipient.
        Such notices shall be addressed to each director at his or her address
        as shown on the books of the corporation. Notice of the time and place
        of holding an adjourned meeting need not be given to absent directors
    if the time and place of the adjourned meeting are fixed at the meeting adjourned
        and if such adjourned meeting is held no more than twenty-four (24) hours
        from the time of the original meeting. Notice shall be given of any adjourned
        regular or special meeting to directors absent from the original meeting
        if the adjourned meeting is held more than twenty-four (24) hours from
        the time of the original meeting.</p>
  <h3>SECTION 11. CONTENTS OF NOTICE</h3>
  <p> Notice of meetings not herein dispensed with shall specify the place, day,
        and hour of the meeting. The purpose of any board meeting need not be

  <h3>SECTION 12. WAIVER OF NOTICE AND CONSENT TO HOLDING MEETINGS</h3>
  <p> The transactions of any meeting of the board, however called and noticed
        or wherever held, are as valid as though the meeting had been duly held
        after proper call and notice, provided a quorum, as hereinafter defined,
        is present and provided that either before or after the meeting each
    director not present signs a waiver of notice, a consent to holding the meeting,
        or an approval of the minutes thereof. All such waivers, consents, or
    approvals
        shall be filed with the corporate records or made a part of the minutes
        of the meeting.</p>
  <h3>SECTION 13. QUORUM FOR MEETINGS </h3>
  <p> A quorum shall consist of two directors. </p>
  <p>Except as otherwise provided in these bylaws or in the articles of incorporation
    of this corporation, or by law, no business shall be considered by the board
    at any meeting at which a quorum, as hereinafter defined, is not present,
    and the only motion which the Chair shall entertain at such meeting is a
    motion to adjourn. However, a majority of the directors present at such meeting
    may adjourn from time to time until the time fixed for the next regular meeting
    of the board. </p>
  <p>When a meeting is adjourned for lack of a quorum, it shall not be necessary
    to give any notice of the time and place of the adjourned meeting or of the
    business to be transacted at such meeting, other than by announcement at
    the meeting at which the adjournment is taken, except as provided in Section
    10 of this Article.</p>
  <p>The directors present at a duly called and held meeting at which a quorum
    is initially present may continue to do business notwithstanding the loss
    of a quorum at the meeting due to a withdrawal of directors from the meeting,
    provided that any action thereafter taken must be approved by at least a
    majority of the required quorum for such meeting or such greater percentage
    as may be required by law, or the articles of incorporation or bylaws of
    this corporation.</p>
  <h3>SECTION 14. MAJORITY ACTION AS BOARD ACTION </h3>
  <p> Every act or decision done or made by a majority of the directors present
        at a meeting duly held at which a quorum is present is the act of the
    board of directors, unless the articles of incorporation or bylaws of this
    corporation,
        or provisions of the California Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation
    Law, particularly those provisions relating to appointment of committees
    (Section
        5212), approval of contracts or transactions in which a director has
    a material financial interest (Section 5233) and indemnification of directors
        (Section 5238e), require a greater percentage or different voting rules
        for approval of a matter by the board.</p>
  <h3>SECTION 15. CONDUCT OF MEETINGS</h3>
  <p> Meetings of the board of directors shall be presided over by the chairperson
        of the board, or, if no such person has been so designated or, in his
    or her absence, the president of the corporation or, in his or her absence,
        by the vice president of the corporation or, in the absence of each of
        these persons, by a chairperson chosen by a majority of the directors
    present
        at the meeting. The secretary of the corporation shall act as secretary
        of all meetings of the board, provided that, in his or her absence, the
        presiding officer shall appoint another person to act as secretary of
    the meeting.</p>
  <p>Meetings shall be governed by common courtesy, as such rules may be revised
    from time to time, insofar as such rules are not inconsistent with or in
    conflict with these bylaws, with the articles of incorporation of this corporation,
    or with provisions of law.</p>
  <h3>SECTION 16. ACTION BY UNANIMOUS WRITTEN CONSENT WITHOUT MEETING</h3>
  <p> Any action required or permitted to be taken by the board of directors
    under any provision of law may be taken without a meeting, if all members
    of
      the board shall individually or collectively consent in writing to such
      action. For the purposes of this Section only, &quot;all members of the
      board&quot; shall not include any &quot;interested director&quot; as defined
      in Section 5233 of the California Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation
      Law. Such written consent or consents shall be filed with the minutes of
      the proceedings of the board. Such action by written consent shall have
      the same force and effect as the unanimous vote of the directors. Any certificate
      or other document filed under any provision of law which relates to action
      so taken shall state that the action was taken by unanimous written consent
      of the board of directors without a meeting and that the bylaws of this
      corporation authorize the directors to so act, and such statement shall
      be prima facie evidence of such authority. </p>
  <h3>SECTION 17. VACANCIES</h3>
  <p> Vacancies on the board of directors shall exist (1) on the death, resignation,
        or removal of any director, and (2) whenever the number of authorized
    directors is increased.</p>
  <p>The board of directors may declare vacant the office of a director who has
    been declared of unsound mind by a final order of court, or convicted of
    a felony, or been found by a final order or judgment of any court to have
    breached any duty under Section 5230 and following of the California Nonprofit
    Public Benefit Corporation Law.</p>
  <p>Any director may resign effective upon giving written notice to the chairperson
    of the board, the president, the secretary, or the board of directors, unless
    the notice specifies a later time for the effectiveness of such resignation.
    No director may resign if the corporation would then be left without a duly
    elected director or directors in charge of its affairs, except upon notice
    to the attorney general.</p>
  <p>Vacancies on the board may be filled by approval of the board or, if the
    number of directors then in office is less than a quorum, by (1) the unanimous
    written consent of the directors then in office, (2) the affirmative vote
    of a majority of the directors then in office at a meeting held pursuant
    to notice or waivers of notice complying with this Article of these bylaws,
    or (3) a sole remaining director. If this corporation has members, however,
    vacancies created by the removal of a director may be filled only by the
    approval of the members. The members, if any, of this corporation may elect
    a director at any time to fill any vacancy not filled by the directors.</p>
  <p> A person elected to fill a vacancy as provided by this Section shall hold
      office until the next annual election of the board of directors or until
      his or her death, resignation, or removal from office.</p>
  <h3>SECTION 18. NONLIABILITY OF DIRECTORS</h3>
  <p> The directors shall not be personally liable for the debts, liabilities,
        or other obligations of the corporation.</p>
  <h3>SECTION 19. INDEMNIFICATION BY CORPORATION OF DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES,
    AND OTHER AGENTS</h3>
  <p> To the extent that a person who is, or was, a director, officer, employee,
      or other agent of this corporation has been successful on the merits in
    defense of any civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative proceeding
    brought
      to procure a judgment against such person by reason of the fact that he
    or she is, or was, an agent of the corporation, or has been successful in
    defense
      of any claim, issue, or matter, therein, such person shall be indemnified
      against expenses actually and reasonably incurred by the person in connection
      with such proceeding.</p>
  <p>If such person either settles any such claim or sustains a judgment against
    him or her, then indemnification against expenses, judgments, fines, settlements,
    and other amounts reasonably incurred in connection with such proceedings
    shall be provided by this corporation but only to the extent allowed by,
    and in accordance with the requirements of, Section 5238 of the California
    Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation Law.</p>
  <h3>SECTION 20. INSURANCE FOR CORPORATE AGENTS</h3>
  <p> The board of directors may adopt a resolution authorizing the purchase
    and maintenance of insurance on behalf of any agent of the corporation (including
        a director, officer, employee, or other agent of the corporation) against
        any liability other than for violating provisions of law relating to
    self-dealing
        (Section 5233 of the California Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation
    Law) asserted against or incurred by the agent in such capacity or arising
    out
        of the agent's status as such, whether or not the corporation would have
        the power to indemnify the agent against such liability under the provisions
        of Section 5238 of the California Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation
        Law.</p>

    of
        the board, one or more vice presidents, assistant secretaries, assistant
        treasurers, or other officers. Any number of offices may be held by the

        whichever occurs first.</p>
  <h3>SECTION 3. SUBORDINATE OFFICERS</h3>
  <p> The board of directors may appoint such other officers or agents as it
    may deem desirable, and such officers shall serve such terms, have such authority,

    board
        of directors.</p>
  <h3>SECTION 4. REMOVAL AND RESIGNATION</h3>
  <p> Any officer may be removed, either with or without cause, by the board
    of directors, at any time. Any officer may resign at any time by giving written
        notice to the board of directors or to the president or secretary of
    the
        corporation. Any such resignation shall take effect at the date of receipt
        of such notice or at any later date specified therein, and, unless otherwise
        specified therein, the acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary
        to make it effective. The above provisions of this Section shall be superseded
        by any conflicting terms of a contract which has been approved or ratified
        by the board of directors relating to the employment of any officer of
        the corporation.</p>
  <h3>SECTION 5. VACANCIES</h3>
  <p> Any vacancy caused by the death, resignation, removal, disqualification,
        or otherwise, of any officer shall be filled by the board of directors.
        In the event of a vacancy in any office other than that of president,
    such vacancy may be filled temporarily by appointment by the president until
        such time as the board shall fill the vacancy. Vacancies occurring in
    offices
        of officers appointed at the discretion of the board may or may not be
        filled as the board shall determine.</p>
  <h3>SECTION 6. DUTIES OF PRESIDENT</h3>
  <p> The president shall be the chief executive officer of the corporation and
        shall, subject to the control of the board of directors, supervise and
        control the affairs of the corporation and the activities of the officers.
        He or she shall perform all duties incident to his or her office and
    such other duties as may be required by law, by the articles of incorporation

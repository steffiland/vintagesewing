Hello,

Milliners and want-to-be milliners will be delighted
that we have added four millinery books:

     How to Make Hats (1952) —
http://vintagesewing.info/1950s.html#52hmh
     Millinery Processes (1930) —
http://vintagesewing.info/1930s.html#30mp
     Millinery (1925) —
http://vintagesewing.info/1920s.html#25m
     Millinery (1922) —
http://vintagesewing.info/1920s.html#22m

Fans of the Woman's Institute series will be pleased
with:

     Principles of Tailoring (1933) —

To make it easier to browse, we've reorganized the
Candidates page to sort by category instead of decade.
http://vintagesewing.info/candidates.html

We outgrew our old host (they shut us down for four
days last month for exceeding our bandwidth—and here
we thought that in the professional world, you contact
your customer if there is a problem), so we have
switched hosts. If you notice any broken links or
missing images or pages, please let us know so we can
fix it promptly. (Thank you to Jennie, June M.,
Melissa, and Willie Mae for letting me know about
problems over the last two weeks.)

We are still settling in with the new host, so the
search engine is temporarily inactive. Once we
untangle our database snarl, we should have the
new-and-improved version up and running.  We are also
having technical difficulties with the hotlink
protection feature, so if you select an enlargement
and are instead served a "hotlinking is stealing"
image, please send an email to mmc@vintagesewing.info
and we will try another tweak.

On the corporate front, we have submitted the tedious
paperwork required to register with the many states
who require it to solicit charitable contributions. 
(The combined stack of paperwork was close to two
inches thick!)  On July 1, we will have a button on
the Support page for those of you who would like to
donate cash through PayPal (you don't need to sign up
for a PayPal account if you want to use your credit
card). If you don't want to mess with PayPal, there
will be instructions on where to send a check (or, if
you want to risk it, cash stuffed into an envelope). 
Our proposed three-year budget was approved by the
Board of Directors.

Thank you for your continued interest and your kind
words of encouragement.

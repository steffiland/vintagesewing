    New at VintageSewing.info</h1>
  <h3>April 27, 2008</h3>
  <p>If you are interested in our day-to-day activities, 
    we've started a <a href="blog/index.html">progress 
    blog.</a> There is a learning curved involved with 
    RSS and CSS and PHP and all the other acronyms, 
    so please be patient while we sort it all out.</p>
  <h3>April 26, 2008</h3>
  <p>We're ba-a-a-ack! It has been a very intense three 
    years in the &quot;real&quot; world. Things appear 
    to be settling into a stable pattern and I will 
    resume adding new works. (There was a major promotion, 
    change in marital status, an organ removal and a 
    chronic health condition, first-time home ownership 
    of a broken-down fixer-upper, and the adoption of 
    a rescue dog, to name a few happenings.)</p>
  <p>And then there are the pirates. Not the hot media 
    darlings of 2006; the ones who subvert the purpose 
    of this site. If you look at the bottom of each 
    page, you will notice something new: </p>
  <p><a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/us/"><img src="images/cc.jpg" alt="Creative Commons License" width="88" height="31" border="0" style="border-width:0"/></a></p>
  <p>You see, there are thieves who have stolen our 
    content, burned it onto disks and have been auctioning 
    it off (without attribution, to boot) on eBay. One 
    of the thieves desisted (after sending an abusive 
    email in response to our cease-and-desist notice). 
    The other thief, in Australia, seems not to care. 
    But thank you to those of you who contacted me to 
    let me know this was going on. I don't have the 
    resources to spend on shutting down someone halfway 
    around the world; however, if you know this person 
    and can bring personal pressure on them to cease 
    and desist, it would certainly bring a smile to 
    my face.</p>
  <p>There is a misperception that because the original 
    copy of the works published on this site are in 
    the public domain that this web site's renderings 
    of them are fair game for anyone to use in any manner. 
    The <em>original works</em> are in the public domain; 
    the VintageSewing.info version of them is copyright 
    by the Vintage Sewing Reference Library, Inc. We 
    exist to <em>freely</em> share the information&#8212;emphasis 
    on the FREE. As the Creative Commons license explains 
    in clear, human, terms:</p>
  <p><em>You are free:</em></p>
</div>
<ul>
  <li> 
    <div class="main"><em>To Share &#8212; to copy, 
      distribute, display, and perform the work</em></div>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Under the following conditions:</em></p>
<ul>
  <li> 
    <div class="main"><em>Attribution. You must attribute 
      the work in the manner specified by the author 
      or licensor (but not in any way that suggests 
      that they endorse you or your use of the work).</em></div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div class="main"><em>Noncommercial. You may not 
      use this work for commercial purposes.</em></div>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <div class="main"><em>No Derivative Works. You may 
      not alter, transform, or build upon this work.</em></div>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Can I make it any more clear? You do NOT have permission 
  to repackage the information on this site to sell 
  it, or to charge admission or in any way impede free 
  access to it. This information is to be FREELY shared. 
  I encourage you to share it; you need only include 
  a link or text reference back to this site so people 
  can find their way here and see what other information 
  we have. If you choose to copy entire passages or 
  works to your own site, you must include a clearly 
  visible attribution on each page (for example, <strong>the 
  original web version of this work can be found at 
  <a href="index.html">VintageSewing.info</a></strong>). 
  You can use the images for noncommercial purposes; 
  if used on web sites, include an attribution and link 
  to us (for example, <em><strong>image courtesy of 
  <a href="index.html">VintageSewing.info</a></strong></em>). 
  You may use the images or information for your presentations 
  and include them in your local sewing guild's newsletters, 
  again, with an attribution. If you want to use any 
  of the images on items that will be sold, you need 
  explicit permission (<a href="mailto:mmc@vintagesewing.info">contact 
  me</a>). </p>
<p>If this seems restrictive to you, you are free to 
  acquire an original print version of the work or image, 
  scan it, OCR it, format and code it, clean up the 
  images, and do whatever you would like. If you use 
  anything published by Vintage Sewing Reference Library, 
  Inc., it must be under the terms stated herein.</p>
<p>Back to the topic of new works being added, I would 
  like to let you know that drafting manuals are very 
  dreary to proofread. They are a delight to work with 
  in the real world, allowing you to save a bundle on 
  vintage patterns and to make recreations that fit 
  your own modern body, but they are a bear to get from 
  paper to web form. I am actively proofreading the 
  unending M. Rohr's 1957 <em>Pattern Drafting &amp; 
  Grading, Women's and Misses' Garment Design, inluding 
  junior's, sub-teens, teens, and half sizes,</em> but 
  it's slow going.</p>

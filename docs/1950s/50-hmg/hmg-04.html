  <h3><a name="othermaterials" id="othermaterials"></a>Other Materials</h3>
  <p>I have seen some most attractive gloves in gingham and stockinette, and
    these can quite easily be made at home if you are prepared to go to a certain
    amount of trouble. The material you use must be very closely woven and must
    on no account be the sort of material that frays easily, as this forces you
    to make the seams very much wider than is wise. Gloves of this type can be
    made from pieces left over from a summer frock. If you have to buy new material
    you will need about half a yard for a pair of medium length pull-on style
    gloves. This may seem a lot but you must remember that the gloves have to
    be cut on the bias in order to give the maximum amount of stretch across
    the hand. To get the true bias of a piece of material fold up the selvedge
    edge so that it is either lying along or is parallel to the cut edge. Crease
    this fold, open out your material and lay the pattern on it so that the centre
    line running down the hand is parallel to the crease. Be very careful about
    this as gloves cut off the true bias will tend to wrinkle where they should
    fit smoothly. This method of cutting out is very successful when striped
    or checked materials are used. The checks form a diamond pattern and the
    stripes cross the hand diagonally. When making striped gloves in this way
    remember to reverse the pattern for the second hand so that the stripes go
    in opposite directions. If you want gloves with stripes going up and down
  the hand buy material which is woven or printed in diagonal stripes.</p>
  <p>When cutting out the gloves allow turnings of one-eighth inch on all seams.
    Turn in the seam allowance round each section and press with a hot iron.
    This gives a better result than turning in the edge as you go along and pressing
    the glove afterwards. Baste the seams, then sew them either by hand or machine.
    Stab stitch or oversewing can be used if you prefer to work by hand. Gloves
    made from dress materials can be sewn on the wrong side if liked, as they
    are thin enough to be turned right side out when the sewing is done. If you
    make the seams by hand use backstitch and keep your stitches very small and
    neat. When the gloves are finished they can be pressed in the usual way with
    a hot iron.</p>
  <p>A good finish for a glove of this kind is a pleated frill which can be stitched
    on at the wrist edge. A bias strip of the material can be used to finish
    off the edge, whether it is plain or pleated. Points can be as plain or as
    fancy as you like. Ordinary tucks can be used or the points can consist of
    three rows of chainstitch. Another good material for trimming is rickrack
    braid which can be obtained in a good range of colors as well as black and
    white. Three rows down the back of the glove and one, two or three rows round
    the wrist edge are quickly sewn on and look most attractive.</p>
  <p>The effect to aim for in making gloves of this type is one of crisp smartness.
    Needless to say they must always be immaculately clean and well pressed.
    A trace of starch will keep them crisp and fresh-looking. Such gloves are
    usually only one season's wear but they do save better gloves and are much
    cooler than those made from leather.</p>
  <p>Most nylon is easy to sew and does not fray easily, and it should answer
    quite well for gloves. It can be washed and dried very quickly and some types
    need no ironing, so it might be worth your while to experiment with this
    material.</p>
  <p>Stockinette or lock knit in both silk and wool can be used for gloves, but
    being knitted and not woven it needs slightly different treatment. There
    is no need to cut it on the bias since it has a certain amount of stretch
    naturally. One drawback to using this material is that raw edges inside seams
    tend to roll up, thus making the seams thick and clumsy. One way to prevent
    this is to turn in each section along the seam edges and machine stitch as
    close to the edge as possible. Trim off the surplus material close up to
    the machine stitching, then make up the seams on the wrong side in the usual
    way. The seams may also be sewn on the right side by oversewing [together
    over the machine stitches. Be very careful not to stretch the material while
    the seams are being made.</p>
  <p>Wool stockinette is usually thicker than the silk variety but may be treated
    in the same way. It usually has more of a tendency to run than the lock-knit
    variety but this can be prevented by paying careful attention to the seams.
    Stockinette of all kinds stretches sufficiently for you to be able to make
    the seams on the wrong side, but with the wool variety particularly care
    is needed in the pressing. The handle of a wooden spoon is a great help when
    turning out the fingers, and it can be held inside each finger in turn while
    the seams are being pressed. As a final touch, tuck the fourchette inside
    the fingers and press the gloves flat. Today a very popular fabric for gloves
    is double-woven cotton and double-woven nylon, with a sueded finish.  </p>
  <h3 class="clear"> <a name="eveninggloves" id="eveninggloves"></a><em><a href="illust/diag-28.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',409,473);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/diag-28-t.jpg" alt="Diagram 28" width="204" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Evening Gloves in Net</h3>
  <p>As I mentioned above, long gloves seem to be coming back into fashion for
    evening wear. They are very expensive, however, and many people may feel
    that the cost is not justified by the amount of wear the gloves will get.
    For this reason you may like to experiment with net which has recently reappeared
  in the shops in several attractive colors as well as white.</p>
  <p>There are one or two points which must be borne in mind when using this
    material. It does not stretch as much as suede and consequently the gloves
    must be made large enough to allow them to slip over the arm easily. The
    edges of the net have to be neatened and thus you must allow for the turnings
    when cutting out the gloves.</p>
  <p>I have found that the best and easiest way of cutting out net gloves is
    to reverse the usual procedure and lay the net, carefully ironed and smoothed
    out, on top of the pattern. As the net is transparent you can follow the
    outline of the pattern quite easily. Use double fourchettes without quirks
    as this eliminates the seam at the base of each pair. When cutting the hole
    for the thumb remember that it must be a little smaller than usual to allow
    for the turnings, while the thumb must be a little larger for the same reason.</p>
  <p>Turn in the edges of each section and press with a fairly hot iron. Baste
    the thumb into place, putting the wrong sides together and making sure that
    the folded edges are exactly level. Use ordinary sewing silk and buttonhole
    ]very closely over the edges as shown in Diagram 28. Another method which
    is effective, although it takes a little longer, is to buttonhole all round
    each section, being very careful not to stretch the edge, and then to oversew
    the sections together, taking the stitches through the top of the buttonhole
    stitches only. Yet another way, for those of you who are able to crochet,
    is to baste up the seams and then work double crochet all round each, putting
    your hook into both pieces of material each time.</p>
  <p>Before completing the actual sewing up of the glove, work any trimming that
    may be required. This trimming may consist of rows of chainstitch, simple
    darning patterns, using the holes of the net as a guide, or small motifs
    cut from lace appliqu&eacute;d on to the net. Sequins, scattered at intervals
    all over the glove, except on the palm, are very effective, particularly
    on black. A scroll design up the back only, also looks well.</p>
  <p>A very attractive trimming, which must, however, be done after the glove
    is made up, is to sew on several rows of narrow lace, starting at the thumb
    and going spirally up the arm, ending at the top edge. When sewing on any
    kind of trimming in this way remember to reverse the direction of it for
    the second glove.</p>
  <p>Make a slit in the front of the glove about three inches long, putting half
    of it above the wrist and half below. Bind as narrowly as possible with a
    strip of net and work four or five buttonhole loops as shown in <a href="illust/diag-26.jpg">Diagrams
    26A and 26B</a>. Press the binding and loops.</p>
  <p>Insert the fourchettes in the usual way, fold the glove in half and sew
    up the remainder of the seams. Finish off the top edge in a way which will
    harmonize with the type of trimming you have chosen. A pleated net frill,
    a simple binding or a hem can be used, and if it seems necessary a piece
    of tubular hat elastic can be inserted in the top of the glove. A tiny border
    in fancy crochet can be used, the first row being worked straight into the
    doubled-over net.</p>
  <p>The pattern you use for making net gloves can be used quite easily for making
    a pair of mitts &#8212; the old-fashioned kind whose fingers end just below
    the second joint. These mitts are very attractive when worn with the picture
    type of evening dress or for a small bridesmaid.</p>
  <p>Measure the pattern against the hand and cut each finger to the required
    length plus three-quarters inch for the top hem. Cut out the mitt in the
    usual way, cutting the double fourchettes shorter and straight across the
    top. Turn in the top of each section, then turn in the edges as described
    for the net gloves. This will do away with the necessity for neatening the
    top of the fingers as the hem will be held in place by the seams, although
    a decorative border, worked in crochet or buttonhole stitch, can be added
    if desired. Make up the mitts in the usual way, trimming them and finishing
    off the top edge in one of the ways suggested for the net gloves.  </p>
  <h3> <a name="workinggloves" id="workinggloves"></a>Working Gloves</h3>
  <p>There are several kinds of gloves which are made for some special purpose
    and if you can make ordinary gloves there is no reason why you should not
    make such working gloves, too. Most of them do not demand any great degree
    of skill in the making, and since a fault may pass unnoticed or, at least,
  not matter much, they make very good practice for the beginner.</p>
  <p>Many women like to wear gloves while doing their chores, but it is not always
    a good plan to make use of ordinary gloves that have been discarded. These
    gloves are usually wearing out anyway and the extra strain they are put to
    when their wearers are cleaning grates and sweeping floors generally finishes
    them off entirely. It is better to make a special pair and if they are washable
    so much the better.</p>
  <p>Ordinary material is not particularly suitable though it can be used if
    it is very closely woven. Looser weaves allow dirt and dust to seep through.
    Cheap quality chamois or &quot;wash leather,&quot; as it is usually called,
    answers the purpose admirably. You can sometimes buy bundles of this fairly
    cheaply, and even if you have to have a few joins you will find that gloves
    made from it will give you a surprising amount of wear.</p>
  <p>Use an ordinary glove pattern in a slightly larger size than you usually
    wear. Make it with fourchettes but no quirks. The gloves should be long enough
    to cover the wrist and should fit fairly closely so that dust and dirt cannot
    get in easily. Take care to make the seams really strong as such gloves get
    far harder wear than ordinary ones.  </p>
  <h3 class="clear"><a name="gardening" id="gardening"></a>Gardening Gloves</h3>
  <p><em><a href="illust/diag-29.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',714,455);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/diag-29-t.jpg" alt="Diagram 29" width="110" height="180" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Many people who are keen gardeners dislike getting their hands stained and
    scratched and prefer to wear gloves of some kind. For such jobs as pruning
    rose trees and digging, gloves are essential, and if they can be made at
    home so much the better for your purse. For really heavy work, fingerless
    gloves with a thumb can be worn. Some gardeners, however, find that mittens
    do not give them enough freedom of movement and they might like the sort
    of gloves shown in Diagram 29. These have a thumb and a first finger, the
    other three fingers not being separate. To make them, use an ordinary larger
    size pattern but omit the two outer slits on each side. You will need only
    one pair of fourchettes for each glove and these should be inserted in the
    usual way up the side of the first finger and the section which will cover
  the other three fingers.</p>
  <p>You will need very strong, tough leather although it must be fairly flexible.
    Sew it with string thread and a thick gloving needle. If you feel you would
    like to stitch it by machine make sure that your machine will sew really
    thick stuff and use a fairly large needle. Another method is to pierce holes
    with a sharp nail and then sew through these. When sewing these gloves by
    hand make the seams on the right side using stab stitch.  </p>
  <h3> <a name="sleeping" id="sleeping"></a>Sleeping Gloves</h3>
  <p>At one time it used to be possible to buy gloves impregnated with some kind
    of hand lotion and these were worn during the night. Many people find that
    even if they rub cream into their hands before going to bed it soon rubs
    off. This is especially the case where people suffer from chilblains and
    like to rub some kind of ointment into their fingers that may stain the bedclothes.
    For both purposes a pair of soft gloves will be found to be of great help.
  A couple of pairs, daintily finished, would make a delightful Christmas present.</p>
  <p>The material you choose for gloves of this kind should be soft and warm.
    A woolen finished material such as flannel is excellent for the purpose as
    it does not chill the hands when it is put on, though I have seen good gloves
    made from the best parts of an old twill sheet. They combined warmth with
    softness, ease of washing and durability.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illust/diag-30.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',566,452);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/diag-30-t.jpg" alt="Diagram 30" width="138" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>There is no need to use an elaborate pattern for these gloves. Fourchettes
    can be dispensed with, provided the fingers are made wide enough, though
    a diamond shape gusset at the base of each finger can be used to give a little
    extra room. Diagram 30 shows how this is put in.</p>
  <p>Make single seams on the wrong side, either by machine or by hand. In the
    latter case the seams should be backstitched. Turn the gloves right side
    out and bind the wrist edge with a piece of bias binding in a contrasting
    color. Embroider a spray of flowers or an initial in a shade to match the
    binding and press the gloves well.</p>
  <p>Gloves made for this purpose must not be the least bit tight, especially
    if the wearer suffers from chilblains, but as they are apt to slip off during
    the night if they are not secured in some way, it is wise to insert a piece
    of elastic right across the front section. This should be tight enough to
    keep the glove on bur loose enough for the wearer not to be conscious of
    it.  </p>
  <h3> <a name="childrens" id="childrens"></a>Children's Gloves</h3>
  <p>Children's gloves are very expensive to buy, but even in these days most
    mothers like their children to have one pair of kid gloves &quot;for best.&quot; If
    they can be made at home they will cost a good deal less than if they were
    bought in a shop. They can be made from fairly small pieces of leather, and
    often a skin which is not large enough for two full-sized pairs of gloves
    will leave enough over to make a pair for a child. Thin leathers such as
    kid should be used for children's gloves. Suede and other fancy leathers
    are not suitable. Patterns, too, should be extremely simple with machine-stitched
  points, no gauntlets and a one stud fastening.</p>
  <p>Fingerless mittens are best for small children as they have great difficulty
    in finding the right finger, especially when the gloves are lined. Fur-backed
    gloves and those made from sheepskin should always be made without fingers.
    Those with a zip across the hand delight small boys, while fur-backed gloves, &quot;just
    like Mummy's,&quot; will please their sisters. Gaily embroidered felt mittens
    are a good investment for children especially if they are worn over a pair
    of thin knitted ones.</p>
  <p>It may be thought that since gloves for children are smaller than those
    worn by adults they will be less trouble to make, but I must warn you that
    this is not always so. Of course, the seams are a little shorter but the
    pieces from which the glove is made being smaller they are usually more fussy
    to put together.</p>
  <p>Knitted gloves are usually considered the most suitable for toddlers and
    babies who are still at the pram stage, though some mothers like to dress
    their offspring in white fur-backed mittens with no thumb or fingers. The
    palms should be made from white kid. If this is not obtainable doeskin can
    be used as a substitute.  </p>
  <h3> <a name="caring" id="caring"></a>Caring for Your Gloves</h3>
  <p>When you have spent a lot of time making a pair of gloves you will not want
    to spoil them by not caring for them properly. Leather, suede or chamois
    gloves should never in any circumstances be rolled together in a ball. This
    creases them and stretches them in the wrong place. Nor should they be thrown
    anyhow into a drawer to lie tangled up with hankies, scarves and what-have-you.
    Keep them pressed out flat in a special box or drawer. If your space is limited
    you can always tuck a lidless box into one corner of a drawer and keep your
  gloves in that.</p>
  <p>The old habit of blowing into each glove as soon as it was removed had much
    to recommend it, particularly as it was usually followed by the careful smoothing
    out and putting away of the gloves. Do not make a practice of carrying your
    gloves in your hand as this makes them creased and limp.</p>
  <p>Fur-backed gloves need careful treatment if they are to retain their good
    looks. When you take them off smooth the fur over the finger tips and never
    put them away where anything hard is liable to get put on top of them. During
    the summer it is a good plan to wrap them up in newspaper. Tuck a card impregnated
    with D.D.T. into the parcel as a precaution against moths. Take them out
    and shake them once in a while.</p>
  <p>Cleaning gloves is often a problem. Suede cannot, as a rule, be successfully
    cleaned, though it can be made to wear longer by rubbing shiny patches with
    a piece of emery paper. Brush the gloves afterwards the way of the pile,
    using a special suede brush. Suede cleaner, such as that sold for cleaning
    shoes, can be used, but great care must be taken when brushing the gloves
    afterwards that every trace of the cleaner is removed. If this is not done
    properly you run the risk of soiling everything you touch.</p>
  <p>Chamois and doeskin can, of course, be washed. Put the gloves on and wash
    in warm, soapy water. Swish several times, using clean soapy water, then
    pull the gloves into shape gently and lay flat on a towel to dry away from
    the sun or fire. Pull the gloves on several times while they are drying,
    kneading them gently to keep the skin supple. Cleaning fluids should never
    be used on leather as they are liable to damage the surface and may remove
    the dye.</p>
  <p>The woolen linings of gloves sometimes get soiled but it is a comparatively
    simple matter to clean them. Turn the gloves inside out with the aid of a
    wooden spoon and clean them with one of the proprietary brands of cleaning
    fluid, following the directions on the bottle. Be careful not to let the
    liquid soak through to the leather. Allow the gloves to dry thoroughly, leaving
    them in a current of air to get rid of any smell, then turn them right side
    out and pull into shape.</p>
  <p>One difficulty sometimes met with in wearing unlined suede gloves is that
    the dye is liable to come off on the fingers. To prevent or at least to mitigate
    this, sprinkle talcum powder in the gloves before putting them on.</p>
  <p>Never dry wet gloves in front of a fire or on a radiator as this will make
    the leather hard. Leave them to dry naturally. Fur gloves may be brushed
    with a soft brush as soon as they are quite dry.  </p>
  <h3> <a name="mending" id="mending"></a>Mending Gloves</h3>
  <p>Properly made gloves will last for a long time especially if you have been
    careful to see that they fit well. There does come a time, however, when
    seams come apart and the gloves need mending. In this case the obvious thing
    to do is to use similar thread to that with which the glove was originally
    sewn and simply resew the seam. Go well past the ends of the split at the
  beginning and end and be sure to fasten off firmly.</p>
  <p>Sometimes an actual hole may be worn in the gloves, usually at the tip of
    one of the fingers. There are two ways of dealing with this, one for thin
    leathers and the other for thick. The first method is to cut a scrap of leather
    slightly larger than the hole. Put the glove on and tuck the small piece
    of leather under the hole so that it lies smoothly and fell the edges of
    the hole to the patch with very tiny stitches. If the glove is lined the
    patch will be tucked between the leather and the lining. If the glove has
    no lining, turn it inside out and fell the edges of the patch to the wrong
    side of the leather.</p>
  <p>For the second method use matching silk or buttonhole twist and buttonhole
    very closely and neatly all round the edge of the hole. Go on working, putting
    the second row into the top loops only of the first row. Continue in this
    way, going round and round until the hole is completely filled. Take the
    thread to the inside and fasten off very firmly.  </p>

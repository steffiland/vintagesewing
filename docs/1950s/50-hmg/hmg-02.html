  <p>The most essential piece of equipment the glove maker needs is a really
    reliable pattern &#8212; or, rather, a series of patterns covering various
    sizes of gloves. The best patterns are made from thin card about the thickness
    of a postcard, and this is a great help when you are marking out your pattern.
    Some makers of glove patterns use the flimsy paper you find in ordinary dressmakers'
    patterns and these are not so good, as you will soon find when you begin
    to draw round them. To remedy this you should paste the paper pattern to
    a piece of thin card or stiff drawing paper. Leave under a weight for at
    least twenty-four hours and when dry cut out the pattern very carefully.
    In this way you retain any necessary directions which may be printed on the
    pattern and reduce the risk of making an error, as you might if you traced
  off the pattern on to your card.</p>
  <p>Bought patterns usually consist of the pattern for the trank, one thumb
    and one fourchette. If quirks are included the pattern will be given for
    this. It is a wise precaution to fasten the smaller pieces to the trank with
    a paper clip as they are very easily mislaid. The pattern will, of course,
    have to be reversed for the second hand. Should you happen to be short of
    material, it is a good plan to cut out the trank again in paper, marking
    it carefully so that you know which hand it is for. You can then lay both
    tranks on your material, moving them about so that you can use your leather
    to the best advantage.</p>
  <p>Butterick, Vogue and other popular pattern firms make glove patterns that
    sell for about thirty-five cents and are usually stocked by department stores.
    Patterns can usually be obtained in sizes ranging from 6 to 7 1/2 for women,
    8 to 9 for men and 1 to 6 for children, and they usually have the size printed
    clearly on the outside of the envelope.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illust/illus-41.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',479,739);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/illus-41-t.jpg" alt="Measuring hand for glove size" width="274" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>If
    you are intending to make gloves of various kinds and sizes it is advisable
    to build up a collection of simple styles in various sizes rather than a
    bigger selection of styles in only one or two sizes. It is much easier to
    adapt the style of a pattern than to alter the size, although this can be
    done to a limited extent. The size of a glove is usually based on the measurement
    around the widest part of the hand. </p>
  <p>Since you are going to be a custom glove maker, tailoring to your own hand,
    why not fit each hand correctly in case the right is larger than the left,
    as often happens? Your tape may show a quarter size variation for the larger
    hand. Take this difference into consideration when checking your patterns.  </p>
  <h3> <a name="adapting" id="adapting"></a>Adapting a Pattern</h3>
  <p>People's hands vary very much both as to size and shape. Two people may
    both take size 6 1/2 in gloves, but whereas one may have long, thin fingers,
    the other may have short, stumpy ones. In addition to this there is a wide
    variation of the proportions between one finger and another. It is obviously
    impossible for the manufacturers of glove patterns to cater to all these
    differences. However, you will find that as long as a pattern is wide enough
  <em>over the knuckles</em>, you can make as many alterations as you like in
  the length.</p>
  <p>When you buy a pattern open it out and lay your hand flat on it. Notice
    whether your fingers are longer or shorter than the pattern. If they are
    shorter, take a pencil and draw round the top of each finger, allowing for
    a seam of one-sixteenth of an inch. Trim off the pattern along your pencil
    lines. Should your fingers be longer than those of the pattern, gum a strip
    of paper to each finger, draw round your own fingers as before and trim off
    to the correct size.</p>
  <p>One measurement which may need a little adjustment is the length of the
    slits between the fingers. Notice if each slit comes right to the bottom
    of the appropriate finger. If it does not, make it a little longer. If it
    is too long, put a pencil mark at the proper place and when you are marking
    out your glove remember to end the slit at this mark.</p>
  <p>A professional glove maker of my acquaintance always asks her clients to
    place their hands on a piece of paper so that she can draw round them. In
    this way she has built up a file of individual fittings, as well as a reputation
    for making gloves that really fit. I may add that she is always so busy that
    winter gloves have to be ordered in the summer and vice-versa.</p>
  <p>If you have to make gloves for a very short hand, cut the fingers and thumb
    shorter as described above and then move the thumb hole up towards the fingers
    for a distance of from one-quarter to one-half inch as required. Should you
    want to use a pattern for unlined gloves to make a pair of lined ones, you
    must make it larger to allow for the extra thickness inside. Allow extra
    width up to one-quarter inch on each side of the trank, tapering off to nothing
    when you get to the fingers. Allow extra width on each fourchette and all
    round the thumb. The hole where the thumb will go must be enlarged a little
    so that the thumb will fit smoothly.</p>
  <p>There are several ways in which you can alter the style of a glove provided
    the pattern is a fairly simple one to begin with. A simple pull-on style
    can be adapted to make a pair of gauntlet gloves by lengthening the trank
    by two or three inches and by sloping it outwards at the wrist edge. A triangular
    gusset can be inserted in the side seam to give extra width but should not
    extend beyond the wrist. A long, narrow gusset is more graceful than a short,
    wide one. Two or three small gussets in a contrasting color or texture are
    smart and make a good way of using up odd bits.</p>
  <p>If you wish to use an ordinary glove pattern for making a pair of mittens
    simply leave out the slits for the fingers and cut the top edge into a smooth
    continuous curve.</p>
  <p>When buying patterns consider the thickness of the leather you intend to
    use. A thick skin will give you a smaller glove than if you use the same
    pattern for a thinner skin. If you get a pattern that is suitable for a stretchable
    skin such as chamois you will find that it will be smaller than one labeled
    with the same size intended for a thicker and stiffer skin. For this reason
    it is wise to notice what sort of leather is suggested on the pattern before
    you buy it.  </p>
  <h3> <a name="basic" id="basic"></a>Making a Basic Pattern</h3>
  <p>Some workers prefer to work from a basic pattern which they adapt and alter
    as the need arises. This is quite a good idea once you have acquired sufficient
    experience to judge what alterations are required. If you are a beginner,
    however, it is wise to use bought patterns at first, since a great deal can
  be learned from them.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illust/diag-18.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',697,368);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/diag-18-t.jpg" alt="Diagram 18" width="90" height="187" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>To make a basic pattern to fit your own measurements, take a piece of drawing
    paper and lay your left hand flat on it with the fingers closed. Draw all
    round the hand as far as the wrist on each side. Open each pair of fingers
    in turn and put a dot at the base of each. Join these dots to the top of
    the fingers with a ruler, making sure that all your lines are <em>perfectly
    parallel</em>.
    Lengthen the pattern by about two inches, sloping it out slightly on the
    edge opposite to the thumb. (Diagram 18.)</p>
  <p class="clear">Fold the paper in half along the edge of the index finger and cut out in
    the double paper, making the slits between the fingers on the front of the
    hand one-quarter inch shorter than the <em><a href="illust/diag-21.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',696,431);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/diag-21-t.jpg" alt="Diagram 21" width="106" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>corresponding <em><a href="illust/diag-20.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',718,494);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/diag-20-t.jpg" alt="Diagram 20" width="119" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>slits<em><a href="illust/diag-19.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',694,479);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/diag-19-t.jpg" alt="Diagram 19" width="119" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em> on the back. (Diagram
    19.) Cut out the hole for the thumb as shown in Diagram 20 and letter it
    carefully. Using the pattern as a guide to the length of the thumb, cut out
    as shown in Diagram 21. Cut the slit as shown and letter the thumb. Make
    sure that the line AB on the thumb is exactly the same length as the line
    AB on the trank and that the lines BC on each section are the same length.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illust/illus-46.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',564,474);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/illus-46-t.jpg" alt="Cutting out thumb" width="146" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Cut out your fourchette and quirk patterns as shown in <a href="illust/diag-01.jpg">Diagrams
      1</a> and<a href="illust/diag-02.jpg"> 2</a>,
    making sure that the fourchettes are equal to the longest finger. When you
    are sure your pattern is as accurate as you can make it, trace it on to a
    piece of stiff paper or thin card and cut it out carefully. Mark the pattern
    as being for the left hand and put in the letters which show how to join
    in the thumb. Store your pattern in a large strong envelope with as few folds
    as possible.  </p>
  <h3 class="clear"> <a name="storing" id="storing"></a>Storing Patterns</h3>
  <p>Patterns should always be kept as flat as possible. Keep all the pieces
    of a pattern clipped together with the directions in the envelopes and add
    any details you may wish to remember. Store all your envelopes in a flat
    box where the patterns will not get creased. If you should have the misfortune
    to tear a pattern it can be mended quite easily with a strip of gummed paper
  or Scotch tape. </p>

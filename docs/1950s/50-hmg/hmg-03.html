  <p><em>(a) Choosing the Skin</em></p>
  <p>The making of a pair of unlined chamois gloves is quite simple even if you
    have never made any gloves before. As the material is soft and pliable it
    is an excellent leather on which the beginner can experiment. Buy as good
    a quality of leather as you can afford. Do not be tempted to buy a cheap
    leather in case you spoil it. The chances are that this is just what you
    will do, simply because poor chamois is more difficult to use than a better
    quality. You will inevitably be disappointed with the result of your work
    and probably decide that glove making is a waste of time which, of course,
    it is, if you are satisfied to put your work into poor material.</p>
  <p>When you buy the skin hold it up to the light and note if there are thin
    places or flaws in it. If these are near the middle choose another skin.
    Feel, too, if there are any hard bits in it. If these are near the edge they
    will not matter, but a thick spot near the centre can be a nuisance.</p>
  <p>Having chosen your leather decide how you are going to stitch it. Black,
    brown, or navy buttonhole twist is decorative, and being in a contrasting
    color is a great help in showing you if your seams are done properly. The
    stitch must be done very evenly, so if you are in any doubt as to your ability
    to make the stitches perfectly regular choose a matching gloving thread.
    You will not need a special gloving needle for chamois, but can use an ordinary
    sewing needle with an eye large enough to take whatever thread you decide
    to use.</p>
  <p><em>(b) Marking and Cutting Out</em></p>
  <p>This is almost the <em>most important operation</em> in glove making and it is imperative
    that you do it properly. No amount of &quot;wangling&quot; afterwards will
    put right a seam that is even slightly askew. Stretch the leather well in
    all directions. Some chamois leather is supplied to the shops, already stretched,
    and if this has been done you need not stretch it further, except to find
    out which way is more elastic. Most good leathers stretch more across the
    width than they do lengthways, and when placing your pattern on the leather
    you must make sure that the &quot;stretch&quot; will go round the hand and
    not up and down.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illust/illus-51.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',480,740);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/illus-51-t.jpg" alt="Drawing around pattern" width="274" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Pin
    the leather, well-stretched, face down on a drawing board or other perfectly
    smooth surface. The top of the kitchen table will do quite well if you have
    no objection to sticking thumbtacks in it. Lay the pattern on the leather
    and go round each section very carefully, using a soft well-sharpened pencil.
    Hold the pattern very firmly so that it cannot slip, since it is very easy
    to make an error which you will not be able to put right once the glove has
    been cut out. Draw round the top of each finger, then bend back each section
    so that you can draw the lines for the slits between them. </p>
  <p class="clear">Turn<em><a href="illust/illus-55.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',577,470);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/illus-55-t.jpg" alt="Cutting out trank" width="141" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em> the<em><a href="illust/illus-53.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',563,473);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/illus-53-t.jpg" alt="Cutting out fourchettes" width="146" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em> patterns for the trank and thumb over for the second glove and
    be careful to draw the hole for the thumb very accurately. When using chamois
    you may find it more economical to turn the pattern upside down for the second
    glove. If you wish to do this it is a good idea to cut out the first trank
    and lay it beside the pattern while you draw the second one. In this way
    you can make quite sure that you will not find yourself with two gloves for
    the same hand.</p>
  <p>As chamois is so pliable and stretches in wear, even when it has been well-stretched
    beforehand, it is not usual to include quirks. You will, therefore, find
    that most chamois patterns use single fourchettes. Draw round the fourchette
    pattern six times for the first glove, then turn it over and draw round it
    another six times. The thumb and fourchettes must be placed on the leather
    in the same directions as the main part.</p>
  <p>You will probably find your pencil point wearing down as you work, so keep
    a penknife handy. Absolute accuracy is essential as otherwise the various
    parts of the glove will not fit, and even the thickness of a pencil can make
    a difference.</p>
  <p>Having marked out all the pieces, remove the thumbtacks and cut out each
    piece very carefully, following the pencil line.</p>
  <p>Make long smooth cuts wherever possible, for it is very difficult to trim
    off jagged edges once the leather has been cut.</p>
  <p><em>(c) Making Up</em></p>
  <p>The one drawback to making up chamois leather, which does not affect other
    types, is that if it is of good quality it is sometimes difficult to tell
    the right side from the wrong. For this reason I always make a practice of
    inserting both thumbs first. Once I have made sure that I have a glove for
    each hand I can finish one glove outright.</p>
  <p>The insertion of the thumb often proves to be difficult for the beginner,
    but if you study the pattern or the diagrams I give you, you should find
    it quite simple. Remember that the lowest point of the projecting piece on
    the trank always goes to the top of the slit on the thumb. Lay the wrong
    sides of the thumb and trank together so that the point marked A on the trank
    is on top of the point marked A on the thumb and the two edges marked AB
    are together. The two edges must be exactly the same size. Stab stitch the
    seam, starting at A and going on to B. Continue the seam along the lines
    marked BC till you come to C. Place the edge of the hole and the curved edge
    of the thumb together and continue the seam until you are halfway round the
    hole. Now fold the thumb in half and stab stitch the two edges together,
    starting at the top and going down the side of the thumb. Continue round
    the hole till you reach the place where you left off. Fasten off both ends
    firmly on the wrong side.</p>
  <p class="clear">You <em><a href="illust/illus-57.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',555,469);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/illus-57-t.jpg" alt="Sewing in thumb" width="147" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>may<em><a href="illust/diag-22.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',392,356);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/diag-22-t.jpg" alt="Diagram 22" width="158" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em> find that the thumb is a little too large for your hole in spite
    of all your care in marking and cutting out. Do not try to gather or ease
    the thumb to make it fit, but stretch the edge of the hole <em>very gently</em> so
    that the seam lies perfectly flat. This usually has the effect of making
    the thumb fit perfectly, but if it should not you may cut off the merest
    shaving of leather, either round the edge of the hole or round the bottom
    of the curved edge of the thumb. If the opposite happens and you find that
    your thumb is too small, stretch the edge of the thumb. (Diagram 22.)</p>
  <p>The next process is to put in the points. Tucks are the most usual method
    for chamois gloves as the thonged decorations mentioned earlier are more
    suitable for thicker and stiffer leathers. You will probably find that the
    position of the points is indicated on your pattern either by lines or a
    series of dots or holes. If it is not, simply fold the back of the glove
    in half, in line with the centre slit, and make a tuck one-eighth inch deep,
    starting one-quarter inch from the slit and extending for about three inches
    down the back of the glove. Open out the trank and refold in line with the
    slit nearest the thumb. Slope the tuck in a little towards the bottom of
    the centre tuck and make it the same length, starting one-quarter inch below
    the first tuck and continuing one-quarter inch beyond the end of it. Make
    a third tuck to match on the other side of the first. The tucks may be machine
    stitched instead of worked in stab stitch or they can be worked in crossed
    oversewing.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illust/diag-23.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',733,515);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/diag-23-t.jpg" alt="Diagram 23" width="121" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>The next step is to sew the fourchettes together in pairs, oversewing them
    on the wrong side along the short edge. Watch carefully to see that you have
    three pairs for each hand. Now take the first pair and place the end of the
    seam you have just made to the bottom of the slit between the first two fingers
    on the back of the hand so that the longest side of the right-hand fourchette
    lies along the inner edge of the first finger. (Diagram 23.) Stab stitch
    the finger and fourchette together until you reach a point about halfway
    up. Then measure the fourchette. As the fourchettes are all cut the same
    length it is obvious that some of them will be too long. Trim the fourchette
    you are sewing so that the top is the same shape as before. The pointed tip
    should reach to a point about three-sixteenths of an inch below the centre
    of the curved top of the finger. Continue to the very top of the fourchette
    and fasten off very firmly. Some people like to take point of the fourchette
    to the very tip of the finger, but personally I find it is possible to make
    a much neater finish if they do not quite meet. Go back to the bottom of
    the fourchette and sew the back of the second one of the pair to the edge
    of the second finger, trimming it off to fit as before. Sew the next pair
    between the second and third fingers and the last pair between the third
    and fourth fingers.</p>
  <p>Now take a thread long enough to go all round the fingers as far as the
    wrist edge and stab stitch the front sections of the fingers to the free
    edges of the fourchettes. Make sure that the end of the seam in the fourchettes
    fits exactly into the bottom of the proper slit. When you reach the tip of
    the little finger merely sew edges down the side of the glove until you reach
    the wrist edge.</p>
  <p>If the glove fits at all loosely sew a piece of elastic to the wrist. Finish
    off the wrist edge in one of the ways described above. When the gloves are
    finished, press them as flat as possible by tucking in the fourchettes till
    each one is hidden by the back and front of the fingers. Press for at least
    twenty-four hours under a heavy weight. A pile of books will do provided
    the gloves are completely covered. This treatment will give a professional
    finish to your work, and though it will not be mentioned again it should
    be used on every type of glove described in this book, except of course such
    gloves as can be pressed in the usual way with a hot iron.  </p>
  <h3 class="clear"> <a name="unlinedman" id="unlinedman"></a>Making Unlined Gloves for a Man</h3>
  <p><em><a href="illust/illus-59.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',480,739);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/illus-59-t.jpg" alt="Drawing guide lines for tucks" width="274" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>The making of gloves for men is in most respects exactly the same as making
    them for women. At the same time there are a few points which call for consideration.
    Men are, on the whole, pretty conservative in their ideas about gloves and
    most of them prefer plain kid or pigskin gloves with a one-stud fastening
  and no &quot;fancy bits.&quot;</p>
  <p>Patterns for men's gloves come in various sizes, and it is also possible
    to make a basic pattern for men's gloves as described on a previous page.
    It is not a wise proceeding to attempt to adapt a woman's pattern to make
    a pair of gloves for a man, as too much alteration in width is required.
    The chief difference in the patterns is found in the width of the fingers
    and the fourchettes, since men's hands are usually &#8212; though not always &#8212; thicker
    as well as larger.</p>
  <p class="clear">Since men's<em><a href="illust/diag-24.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',451,473);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/diag-24-t.jpg" alt="Diagram 24" width="184" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em> gloves<em><a href="illust/diag-23.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',733,515);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/diag-23-t.jpg" alt="Diagram 23" width="121" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em> are usually made of fairly sturdy leather it is better
    to include quirks. Mark out your pattern on the wrong side of the leather
    in the usual way. Ordinary drawing pencil can be used for pigskin, but this
    will not show up on a brown leather such as kid. Use instead a white or yellow
    crayon pencil kept well sharpened.</p>
  <p>Cut out all the pieces very carefully and sew the quirks into the fourchettes
    straight away. This lessens the chances of losing the tiny pieces or throwing
    them away as scraps. (<a href="illust/diag-02.jpg">Diagram 2</a>.) Use strong gloving thread in a color to
    match the leather and a three-sided gloving needle.</p>
  <p class="clear">Sew in the<em><a href="illust/illus-63.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',506,472);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/illus-63-t.jpg" alt="Sewing in final fourchette" width="163" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em> thumbs<em><a href="illust/illus-62.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',479,739);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/illus-62-t.jpg" alt="Sewing in fourchette" width="274" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em> as described for the chamois gloves. You will notice that
    the hole and the curved part of the thumb are considerably larger than the
    corresponding parts of a woman's glove. Put in the points next. These should
    be three simple tucks put in either by hand or by machine.</p>
  <p class="clear">Sew the fourchettes between each pair of fingers, putting the longest sides
    to the back of the gloves as before. Fold the glove in half and sew all round
    the fingers and down the side to the wrist edge. <em><a href="illust/illus-65.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',477,737);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/illus-65-t.jpg" alt="Seweing outer edge" width="275" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Make sure that the centre
    point of each quirk comes exactly to the base of each slit on the front of
    the hand. (<a href="illust/diag-24.jpg">Diagram 24</a>.) Sew all these seams very firmly as they get a good
    deal of wear, and be very particular about how you fasten the thread on and
    off.</p>
  <p>If the glove has to have a press stud fastening slit it up the centre front
    to a point just above the bottom of the thumb seam. There is no need to shape
    this opening as the wearing and fastening of the glove will pull it into
    the right shape. Measure the wrist edge and opening and cut a strip of leather
    a little longer and about one-half inch wide. Thicker leather needs a strip
    that is a little wider. Start at the wrist seam and sew this strip all round
    the edge and opening on the right side. When you reach the place where you
    started, cut off the ends of the strip so that they just meet and oversew
    them on the wrong side. Make the seam as flat as possible. Turn the strip
    over on to the wrong side and either machine stitch or herringbone all round.
    Insert the press stud as shown in <a href="illust/diag-15a.jpg">Diagram 15</a>, putting the top half of the
    stud on the side of the glove nearest to the seam. <em>Do not forget</em> to put a
    scrap of leather under each half of the stud so that the stud will not pull
    out when the glove is worn. </p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illust/illus-66.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',530,483);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/illus-66-t.jpg" alt="Strap and snap" width="159" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Another
  men's wrist top is called Strap and Snap.</p>
  <h3> <a name="linedman" id="linedman"></a>Making Lined Gloves for a Man</h3>
  <p>We come now to the making of lined gloves. This is not at all a difficult
    undertaking, although naturally it takes a little longer to make lined gloves
    than it does to make an unlined pair because there are the extra seams in
    the lining. When buying your pattern make sure that it is one that is meant
    for lined gloves or you may find that the finished pair will be too small.
    <em>A size larger</em> than you need in an unlined pattern should be just about the
  right size for a pair with linings.</p>
  <p>Lined gloves are usually better if they have quirks, so it is advisable
    to have double fourchettes. As lined gloves are generally made from thicker
    leather than unlined ones, be very careful when cutting out that you hold
    the scissors at right angles to the leather. Mark and cut out your leather
    and then cut out the tranks and thumbs only in the lining material you have
    chosen or managed to get. If you wish to knit your linings you will need
    one ounce of wool in a fine two-ply and a pair of No. 2 needles. Knit and
    press a specimen square first so that you can calculate how many stitches
    and rows you will need. Use the glove pattern as a guide to size and shape.
    If liked, the thumbs can be knitted all in one with the trank.</p>
  <p>Start in the usual way by sewing in the thumb. Next make the points. If
    you use one of the punched designs described on a previous page, you may
    find that there is a danger of the lining showing through the holes. To remedy
    this cut a strip of thin leather or tape to match the leather and sew it
    neatly over the back of the thonged decoration, being careful not to let
    your stitches show on the right side.</p>
  <p>Sew the lining thumb and trank together by seaming on the wrong side and
    slip the lining thumb into the leather thumb. Lay the lining on top of the
    leather and slip stitch or herringbone the sides of the lining to the seams
    on the back of all the fingers and just inside the cut edge on the front
    of the fingers. Sew the sides of the lining together, starting at the top
    of the little finger and finishing at the wrist edge. Fold the glove in half
    and sew together all round the fingers and down the side. Oversew the lining
    and glove together all round the wrist edge and any slits that may form part
    of the edge. This is not strictly necessary, but makes the binding or hemming
    of the edge very much easier. Turn the edge of the leather up and slip stitch
    or machine to the lining, making sure that the stitches do not go through
    to the right side. Should you, for any reason, wish to thong the wrist edge,
    work the thonging first, then cut the lining a little shorter and slip stitch
    to the wrist edge just above the holes punched for the thonging.  </p>
  <h3> <a name="sheepskin" id="sheepskin"></a>Sheepskin Gloves</h3>
  <p>We come now to a fascinating branch of glove making &#8212; the fashioning
    of attractive gloves from sheepskin or lamb's wool. This material differs
    from ordinary leather in that the wool is left on the outer side of the leather.
    Lamb's wool is usually shorter in pile and much softer than sheepskin. Both
    can be bought in the natural creamy white or dyed to attractive shades of
  red, brown, green and so on.</p>
  <p>When buying sheepskin for gloves see that it is supple with a rather short
    pile. The heavier, stiffer kinds are better for slippers. Examine the skin
    carefully for flaws. Some skins are damaged in the curing and show small
    tears, while others have blemishes where the animal has been hurt on barbed
    wire or something similar. Such skins are very wasteful in use, as you have
    to avoid the flaws when you are cutting out the gloves and this leads to
    a good deal of waste.</p>
  <p>Some of the finer types of sheepskin suitable for gloves are quite small
    and you will normally need two skins to make a pair. A pair of mittens for
    a child can sometimes be made from one small skin, but even then you may
    find you have to have several joins.</p>
  <p>Sheepskin can be used either with the skin outside or with it inside as
    preferred by the wearer or according to the purpose for which the gloves
    are intended. Cyclists, for instance, would probably prefer to have the wool
    inside as the gloves are exposed to all kinds of weather, while the smart
    teen-ager would like her gloves to have sheepskin backs and leather fronts.</p>
  <p>Sheepskin mittens are not difficult to make and are usually easier to sew
    and wear than gloves with fingers. The sheepskin demands special care in
    cutting and sewing. <em>Never</em> cut it with scissors as this will damage the pile.
    Use instead a razor blade or a sharp leather knife. Personally I prefer the
    latter as it has a handle. Remember that whether you use a knife or a razor
    blade it must be really sharp.</p>
  <p>Sheepskin has not quite such a definite &quot;way&quot; of growing as fur,
    but like fur, should always be cut so that the pile goes upwards over the
    fingers. Remember that the wool will take up a good deal of space inside
    the glove, so be sure to cut the gloves large enough to allow for this.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illust/diag-25.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',729,350);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/diag-25-t.jpg" alt="Diagram 25" width="93" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Here are directions for making a pair of sheepskin mittens with the wool
    inside. Gloves with the wool outside should be made in exactly the same way
    as the fur-backed gloves which are dealt with a little later on. Start by
    making a pattern as shown in Diagram 25. If your skin is narrow or you want
    to economize, the pattern can be cut in half along the dotted line. This
    enables you to move the two halves about until the pattern is arranged to
    the best advantage. Do not forget that the stretch must be <em>across</em> the hand.
    Pin your skin firmly to a flat surface and draw all round it; take the knife
    and cut along each line very carefully, making sure that your knife is at
    right angles to the leather. Try to cut through the surface each time, as
    repeated cuts may result in a jagged edge. Some people find it easier to
    lift up the skin and stretch it a little with the left hand, but this is
    a purely personal matter which each worker must decide individually. When
    the skin has been cut right through you can separate the various sections
    by pulling the staples apart very gently.</p>
  <p>The mittens shown in the diagram consist of two parts only &#8212; the trank
    and the thumb. In some patterns the thumb and trank are cut in one piece,
    and in this case you simply fold the mitten in half and sew together all
    round. You will notice that in Diagram 25 the thumb opening is very much
    simpler than in the other patterns we have dealt with, being merely a shallow
    hollow in the front of the glove.</p>
  <p>Before starting to make up the gloves take a sharp pair of scissors and
    snip off the wool all round for about half an inch so that it is a little
    less than half the depth of the rest of the pile. This will prevent the seams
    from becoming thick and clumsy.</p>
  <p>Fold the thumb in half and stitch down the side with stab stitch as far
    as the points marked &quot;x&quot; on the diagram. Smooth the wool away from
    the seam as you work and be careful not to let any strands of the wool poke
    out through your stitches. Use a gloving needle and strong matching thread.
    Sew the curved edge of the thumb into the curved hollow on the edge of the
    front section. Fold the glove in half and starting at the wrist edge sew
    the two halves together, taking in the remainder of the thumb on the way.
    Finish at the end of the top curve or, if you have cut the glove in two sections,
    go on down to the wrist edge.</p>
  <p>The wrist edge can be bound with a strip of matching leather. If you have
    no scraps which can be utilized you can buy leather binding about one inch
    wide in several good colors. If liked, the edge can be turned back to make
    a sheepskin cuff, but in this case the trank must be cut about two or three
    inches longer. Mittens with long gauntlets can be made in exactly the same
    way, but you will, of course, need more skin. Lengthen the pattern till it
    is as long as you want it and at the same time widen out at the wrist edge.  </p>
  <h3> <a name="joining" id="joining"></a>Joining Sheepskin</h3>
  <p>It is quite a simple matter to join sheepskin and if it is well done the
    join will not be seen on the right side. The edges to be joined must be perfectly
    straight and the wool must lie in the same direction. Smooth the staples
    away from edges to be joined, but do not trim them. Oversew very closely
    with fine matching thread, then work a second row of stitching in the opposite
    direction. Fasten on and off very firmly. Avoid joins across the knuckles
  or anywhere where there is likely to be much pull on them.</p>
  <h3> <a name="zip" id="zip"></a>Inserting a Zip</h3>
  <p>Some people like to have a zip across the middle of the hand so they can
    pull off the top part of the mitten to allow the fingers to emerge. This
    is a useful addition to your mittens if you are the sort of person who goes
  about dropping odd gloves here and there.</p>
  <p>It is quite a simple matter to insert a zip and adds only a quarter or so
    to the cost of the gloves. Zips can be obtained in lengths of four inches
    and upwards. They should be put in the gloves before the two halves are joined
    together. Slit the front half of the glove right across about one-half inch
    above the thumb opening. Shave off the wool right down to the skin for about
    half an inch along the edges of the-slit. Neaten the ends of the zip tape
    and turn in the edges of the slit. Top stitch either by hand or by machine
    over the tape, making sure that there is room for the zip key to move freely
    between the edges.</p>
  <p>Zips are not always obtainable in the exact size required, but it is quite
    a simple matter to shorten them. Remove the &quot;stop&quot; at the closed
    end, clip off as many of the teeth as necessary, using a pair of pliers or
    wire cutters, and either replace the stop or oversew the tapes firmly together
    using matching thread.  </p>
  <h3> <a name="furbacked" id="furbacked"></a>Making Fur-Backed Gloves</h3>
  <p>Fur-backed gloves are not really difficult to make although they need a
    little more time and trouble. Most of the fur skins you buy in the shops
    nowadays have their origin on the back of the humble rabbit, but there is
    no reason to despise them on that account. If you buy a good quality, well-cured
    skin it will give you really hard wear for several winters. Most of the furs
  can be obtained in black, gray and brown.</p>
  <p>Beaver and squirrel are two more furs which make good gloves, and you may
    sometimes be able to find enough fur to make a pair of gloves from the best
    parts of a fur coat which has grown too shabby or old-fashioned for further
    wear.</p>
  <p>The pattern for a pair of fur-backed gloves is a little different from that
    which you use for a leather pair owing to the fact that the back and front
    are of different material. The back of the glove usually has the thumb cut
    all in one with the trank, while the front part has half a thumb inserted
    in the usual way.</p>
  <p>Lay the fur face down on a flat surface with the pattern placed on top in
    such a way that the <em>fur strokes upwards</em> over the fingers. This is very important
    and fur gloves must never be cut in any other way. Be particularly careful
    in placing the pattern on fur which has come from what is known as chinchilla
    rabbit. This variety usually has a speckled gray back with a white underside
    which shows as a white border down each side of the cured skin. If the pattern
    is not placed exactly in the centre of the skin you will have more white
    showing down one side than the other and the gloves will look odd. As rabbit
    skins are not very large you will need one skin for each glove, so when buying
    the fur get two skins that match each other as nearly as possible, especially
    with regard to the amount of white in the borders.</p>
  <p>Mark round the pattern with a black or colored pencil and cut out very carefully,
    using a razor blade or a sharp leather knife. Place the pattern for the front
    half on the wrong side of the leather and mark and cut out. Cut out the half
    thumb sections and the fourchettes and quirks. Cut out the linings for the
    tranks but not, of course, for the fourchettes. If knitted linings are made,
    use the glove pattern as a guide and work the lining for each glove in two
    pieces. If you find it easier, you can knit the thumb all in one on both
    back and front. In this case all you need do is knit a piece for the back
    lining and a piece for the front exactly the same, but with all the shapings
    reversed.</p>
  <p>Sew the fourchettes together in pairs. If quirks are used with double fourchettes
    sew these in place. Insert each fourchette in the slits in the back of the
    hand in the usual way, but lay the finger and fourchette together with right
    sides facing instead of with the wrong sides facing as you would if you were
    making a prick seam. Oversew the seams very firmly, smoothing the strands
    of fur away from them as you work. Make sure that the point of each fourchette
    fits exactly into the bottom of the proper slit. Make sure, too, that you
    fasten your thread on and off very firmly as these seams are not so easy
    to repair as those worked in stab stitch.</p>
  <p>Lay the back lining on top of the fur inside the glove and sew the edges
    of the fingers only to the finger seams, leaving the outer edges of the first
    and fourth fingers free for the time being. Join the lining thumb to the
    palm lining, then join the back and front linings together by making a seam
    from the tip of the little finger to the wrist edge on one side and from
    the tip of the first finger all round the thumb and to the wrist edge on
    the other side. This leaves the front fingers loose and these must be left
    as they are until the leather front has been joined to the fur back. Lay
    the two sections together right sides inside and oversew exactly the same
    seams as those made in the lining, again leaving the fingers open. Turn the
    glove right side out and sew the lining fingers to the leather fingers, just
    inside the cut edge.</p>
  <p>Now finish off the glove in the usual way by making a prick seam all round
    the fingers, starting at the top of the first finger and ending at the tip
    of the little finger. Make sure again that the point of each fourchette,
    or the centre point of each quirk fits right into the bottom of the appropriate
    slit.</p>
  <p>Should your glove need a strip of elastic in the wrist, put this in now,
    turning the lining back out of the way while you do it. The wrist edge can
    be finished by simply turning up the leather or fur on to the lining and
    hemming or herringboning down. A row of stab stitch or machine stitch, along
    the edge of the leather part only, makes a good finish. An alternate method
    is to bind the edge of the glove with a narrow strip of leather.  </p>
  <h3> <a name="joiningfur" id="joiningfur"></a>Joining Fur</h3>
  <p>Fur can be joined quite easily in exactly the same way as sheepskin. Wherever
    possible, joins should be placed where there is the least pull on the glove.
    Remember that the fur must all lie in one direction so that the hairs in
    one piece will mingle with those on the other and hide the join. For this
    reason joins can be made in any direction and the back of the skin can look
    like a jigsaw puzzle without any of the seams showing on the right side.
    You must, of course, be careful to see that the color matches too. Oversew
    all joins with fine thread and a fine needle and then flatten them out with
  the thumb.</p>
  <h3> <a name="furtrimmed" id="furtrimmed"></a>Fur-Trimmed Gloves</h3>
  <p>If you have any pieces of fur which are not large enough to make a whole
    pair of fur-backed gloves, you can add a note of luxury to your more ordinary
    leather gloves by giving them a fur trimming. This can consist of a fur gauntlet
    extending all round the glove below the wrist. This trimming is particularly
    effective when carried out with smooth furs such as ocelot, leopard, Persian
    or Indian lamb or astrakhan. Real skins of this type are, at present, expensive,
    so that a little has to go a long way. This is a good way of using up odd
  bits of fur left over when a fur coat has been remodeled.</p>
  <p>Strips of fur varying in width from three to about ten inches can be bought
    by the yard in most good stores. As they are not as a rule wide enough for
    making fur-backed gloves they are of no use to the worker who needs a whole
    skin, but they can be used very effectively as a trimming. There are also
    some quite attractive designs in fur cloth which can be used as a substitute
    for the real thing. These imitation furs are not quite so warm as real fur,
    but a good quality should give you plenty of wear.</p>
  <p>White fur, while hardly suitable for gloves, except for those worn by quite
    tiny children, makes delightfully warm linings. Gloves lined throughout with
    fur are apt to be a little clumsy to wear, though many men prefer them to
    gloves with fur outside. Very soft fine fur with a short pile should be used
    and should be treated exactly as you would treat ordinary woolen linings.
    When cutting out such gloves be very careful to see that the <em>outer covering</em>    is large enough to allow for the fur lining, or the gloves will be too tight.</p>
  <p>Gloves which have the gauntlets only lined with fur are less bulky and are
    very comfortable to wear since the warmth is felt just where the cold wind
    is apt to be felt. As there is little pull on this part of the glove, quite
    small pieces can be joined to make the gauntlet lining. The best way to do
    this is to join up the pieces till you have a piece which is roughly the
    size and shape you need. Cut out the fur, using the lower part of your glove
    pattern. Cut out the lining, making it as much shorter than the glove pattern
    as the depth of the fur gauntlet. Join the fur and the lining together and
    make up the glove in the usual way. An attractive way of finishing off the
    wrist edge is to make the lining about one inch deeper than the actual glove.
    Turn the lining over on to the right side of the glove, thus reversing the
    usual procedure, and hem down neatly. Notice that the fur part of the lining
    must stroke downwards towards the wrist, so that when it is turned up the
    hairs will stroke upwards over your stitches.</p>
  <p></p>
  <h3> <a name="mittens" id="mittens"></a>Mittens from Odds and Ends</h3>
  <p>FUR-LINED MITTENS</p>
  <p>Short-haired fur that is worn and faded is still good for lining mittens.
    The outside of the mittens can be cut from wool cloth, from a worn-out dress,
    coat or trousers. Fur linings use up hand space, so the cloth part must be
    cut larger than it would be ordinarily.</p>
  <p>Mittens and linings are seamed &#8212; the cloth part by machine with decorative
    hand overcasting, the fur by overhanding. With linings in place, wrist edges
    can be turned in and slip-stitched together. Fur cuffs can be made by turning
    back the edges.</p>
  <p>FELT AND KNITTED WOOL MITTENS</p>
  <p>An old felt hat and a pair of wool bobby socks, worn in toes and heels,
    can be made into a pair of warm mittens for school. Use the hat for backs
    of the mittens. Cut palms from the sock tops so the ribbed cuffs will serve
    as wristlets. Thumbs may be either felt or knit. Machine stitch along the
    edge of knit parts to keep them from raveling.</p>
  <p>For novelty, trim edges of the felt mitten backs with pinking shears. Turn
    under and sew the knit palms to the felt backs with hemming stitches; then
    join the two with decorative wool overhanding.</p>
  <p>To make wrist fit closely, run a drawstring through the knit ribbing. Make
    drawstrings by twisting or crocheting wool yarn. Felt, clipped and rolled,
    makes neat tassels for the ends.  </p>
  <h3> <a name="suede" id="suede"></a>Suede Gloves</h3>
  <p>Suede is almost the most attractive leather you can use, especially for
    making gloves of the more formal type. I have lately seen some most attractive
    elbow length gloves in beautiful shades of suede but I must admit that they
    are decidedly expensive, especially as the number of occasions on which they
    can be worn is rather limited. If you can manage to get the suede, you can
    make a pair of similar gloves for about half what they would cost if bought
  from a shop.</p>
  <p>Elbow length gloves naturally require more leather than shorter ones, and
    in the case of suede you cannot economize by turning the pattern for the
    second glove upside down. Make sure, therefore, that the skin you buy is
    long enough to take the trank of each glove with the fingers on each pointing
    upwards.</p>
  <p>As I have already pointed out, suede has a definite pile, and if the various
    sections of the glove are not all placed on the skin in the same direction
    some parts of the finished glove will appear lighter than others. Stroke
    the surface of the skin up and down and notice which way makes the suede
    appear darker. Place the pattern on the skin in such a way that the surface
    looks darker when you stroke it towards the wrist.</p>
  <p>Before marking out your skin measure the arm at its widest point and decide
    whether your glove will be wide enough. If the pattern is a little too narrow
    add the extra width required when you are marking out the pattern. Cut out
    the suede carefully. Quirks can be included if liked, but as suede stretches
    rather more than most leathers they are not strictly necessary.</p>
  <p>Cut a slit three inches long in the centre of the front part of each trank,
    making it one and one-half inches above and below the actual place where
    the wrist joins the hand. Sew in the thumbs and fourchettes in the usual
    way, using very fine thread and a fairly fine needle. Make the seams as narrow
    as possible without sewing them so near to the edge that there is a danger
    of the suede pulling away, and keep the stitches very small and even. Work
    the points on the back of each trank, using simple stab stitched or machine
    stitched tucks.</p>
  <p>Cut a narrow strip of suede and bind the slit in the front of the glove.
    If you are a very neat worker you may like to make small buttonholes in the
    way described on a previous page, but I must warn you that this is a very
    fussy little job and must be done very neatly if it is to be a success. Make
    the buttonholes first, then bind the edge, sewing the binding down over the
    buttonhole strips, but not, of course, over the holes.</p>
  <p class="clear">An easier<em><a href="illust/diag-26.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',303,468);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/diag-26-t.jpg" alt="Diagram 26" width="277" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em> method is to work small buttonhole loops. The number depends on
    the size of the buttons you intend to use, but as these should be very small
    and dainty you will probably find that you will need at least five loops.
    Join the thread to the back of the binding, then take three stitches about
    one-quarter inch long as shown in Diagram 26 A. Work over these stitches
    in close buttonhole stitch to make a loop. (Diagram 26B.) Slip the needle
    through the binding and bring it out a little further on to start the next
    loop. Notice that the loops or buttonholes should be worked on the side of
    the slit nearest to the thumb.</p>
  <p>Fold the glove in half and sew all round the fingers and down the side in
    the usual way; sew on small fancy or pearl buttons to correspond with the
    loops or buttonholes, taking the stitches through the binding and not through
    the single thickness of the suede so that they will not pull a hole in the
    material.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illust/diag-27.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',557,170);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/diag-27-t.jpg" alt="Diagram 27" width="56" height="207" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>The
    edges of this type of glove are usually left unhemmed as the gloves are often
    worn pulled down and wrinkled over the forearm. Another way of
    opening the glove to allow it to be pulled on easily is to insert a zip right
    down the back. Lightweight plastic zips are now available and being made
    in various colors can be decorative as well as useful. Slit the glove for
    the length required, turn in the edges and top stitch either by hand or by
    machine over the zip tape. Be sure to leave sufficient space between the
    suede edges to allow the zip key to move up and down easily. The ends of
    the zips should be finished off neatly as shown in Diagram 27. A small
    tassel is made from the suede or from matching embroidery silk should be
    slipped through the zip key.  </p>
  <h3> <a name="felt" id="felt"></a>Felt Gloves</h3>
<p>Felt is an extremely useful material for making gloves since it can be sewn
  without having to be neatened. It differs from leather in several ways and
  as you would expect needs slightly different treatment on that account. Felt
  is a woolen material but it is made, not by being woven on a loom, but by being
  very closely compressed. It can be thin and rather poor in quality or can be
  really thick and solid. The texture may be coarse or fine, depending upon the
  quality of the wool from which it is made. It can be obtained in all kinds
  of fascinating colors, some deep and vivid, others as delicate as the petals
of a flower.</p>
<p>When choosing felt for glove making look for a firm, close material with a
  very fine texture. It must not be too thick or the gloves you make will be
  clumsy, but it must be firm enough to prevent the material from pulling away
  from the stitches. Felt can be bought by the yard, when it is usually about
  thirty-six inches wide, or it can be obtained in pieces ranging from about
  four to eighteen inches square. The size of these pieces varies very much as
  many shopkeepers cut them up according to their own ideas of what their customers
  will want. The fact that such small pieces can be bought often means a considerable
  saving as you need only buy just as much as you require. All the small scraps
  left over should be saved as they can be used very successfully for making
  appliqu&eacute; trimmings and so on.</p>
<p>Gloves with a thumb only and no fingers can be made very successfully from
  felt and when embroidered in gay colors are very popular with winter sports
  enthusiasts. They usually have the thumb cut in one with trank, and the pattern
  can be made very simply by laying the hand flat on the table and drawing round
  it. Cut out the felt, allowing a good margin all round. The one seam, which
  goes all round the thumb and the top of the hand, can be machine stitched,
  stab stitched or joined with a row of oversewn buttonhole stitch. Any embroidery
  should be worked before this seam is made. The glove may be pressed with a
  hot iron when it is finished, but avoid using a damp cloth as this may shrink
  the felt. Felt used for this type of glove may be considerably thicker than
  that used for gloves which have fingers.</p>
<p>The use of felt for glove making considerably increases the range of colors
  available. Two colors can be combined to good effect. A pair of black felt
  gloves can be enlivened by fourchettes and bindings in pastel shades of blue,
  pink or green, or made vivid with the help of a splash of scarlet, royal blue
  or emerald green. If you wish to use a contrasting shade you need buy only
  just as much as you need.</p>
<p>Felt can be embroidered with wool or silk and any decoration of this kind
  should be done before the glove is made up. Any ordinary transfer design can
  be used and you stamp it on the felt with a hot iron in the usual way. Use
  a yellow transfer for dark shades and a blue for light ones. Should you wish
  to draw your own design you will find that an ordinary pencil or crayon such
  as you use for marking out patterns on leather will be quite satisfactory.</p>
<p>When making up felt gloves mark and cut the pattern just as you would if you
  were using leather. It is possible to pin a paper pattern to the surface of
  the felt and cut out the glove in this way, but the first method is generally
  found to be more satisfactory as it is possible to keep the felt flatter. As
  the felt is not woven there is no need to lay the pattern on it in any particular
  direction, so that you can move your pattern about and cut out the gloves with
  the minimum of waste.</p>
<p>Sew all the seams on the right side, using stab stitch just as you do when
  working with leather. Another method is to use double oversewing to form a
  row of crosses along each seam. Use a slightly thicker thread for this. If
  liked the stitching can be worked in thread of a contrasting color provided
  that the stitches are kept perfectly even. The depth of the stitches must be
  uniform all along the seam. Remember that the needle must go through the felt
  at right angles each time.</p>
<p>Wrist edges may be finished off in any of the ways described in a previous
  section. It is not advisable to use buttons and buttonholes or press studs
  as a fastening as these have a tendency to pull out when the glove is worn.
  If you must use buttons and buttonholes for any reason sew a strip of matching
  tape below the buttons and work the holes with buttonhole twist.</p>
<p>Felt gloves are not usually lined nor is it advisable to use felt for linings
  for leather gloves. It is possible to make seams in felt gloves by machine,
  but unless your machine is extremely easy to manipulate and you are a very
  experienced worker you will find it easier and quicker to do the work by hand.</p>

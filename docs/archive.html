      27, 2008</h3>
    <p>If you are interested in our day-to-day site-related 
      activities, we've started a <a href="blog/index.html">progress 
      blog.</a> There is a learning curved involved 
      with RSS and CSS and PHP and all the other acronyms, 
      so please be patient while we sort it all out.</p>
    <h3><a name="080426" id="080426"></a>April 26, 2008</h3>
    <p>We're ba-a-a-ack! It has been a very intense 
      three years in the &quot;real&quot; world. Things 
      appear to be settling into a stable pattern and 
      I will resume adding new works. (There was a major 
      promotion, change in marital status, an organ 
      removal and a chronic health condition, first-time 
      home ownership of a broken-down fixer-upper, and 
      the adoption of a rescue dog, to name a few happenings.)</p>
    <p>And then there are the pirates. Not the hot media 
      darlings of 2006; the ones who subvert the purpose 
      of this site. If you look at the bottom of each 
      page, you will notice something new: </p>
    <p><a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/us/"><img src="images/cc.jpg" alt="Creative Commons License" width="88" height="31" border="0" style="border-width:0"/></a></p>
    <p>You see, there are thieves who have stolen our 
      content, burned it onto disks and have been auctioning 
      it off (without attribution, to boot) on eBay. 
      One of the thieves desisted (after sending an 
      abusive email in response to our cease-and-desist 
      notice). The other thief, in Australia, seems 
      not to care. But thank you to those of you who 
      contacted me to let me know this was going on. 
      I don't have the resources to spend on shutting 
      down someone halfway around the world; however, 
      if you know this person and can bring personal 
      pressure on them to cease and desist, it would 
      certainly bring a smile to my face.</p>
    <p>There is a misperception that because the original 
      copy of the works published on this site are in 
      the public domain that this web site's renderings 
      of them are fair game for anyone to use in any 
      manner. The <em>original works</em> are in the 
      public domain; the VintageSewing.info version 
      of them is copyright by the Vintage Sewing Reference 
      Library, Inc. We exist to <em>freely</em> share 
      the information&#8212;emphasis on the FREE. As 
      the Creative Commons license explains in clear, 
      human, terms:</p>

    it, or to charge admission or in any way impede 
    free access to it. This information is to be FREELY 
    shared. I encourage you to share it; you need only 
    include a link or text reference back to this site 
    so people can find their way here and see what other 
    information we have. If you choose to copy entire 
    passages or works to your own site, you must include

    You may use the images or information for your presentations 
    and include them in your local sewing guild's newsletters, 
    again, with an attribution. If you want to use any 
    of the images on items that will be sold, you need 
    explicit permission (<a href="mailto:mmc@vintagesewing.info">contact 
    me</a>). </p>
  <p>If this seems restrictive to you, you are free 
    to acquire an original print version of the work 
    or image, scan it, OCR it, format and code it, clean 
    up the images, and do whatever you would like. If 
    you use anything published by Vintage Sewing Reference 
    Library, Inc., it must be under the terms stated 
    herein.</p>
  <p>Back to the topic of new works being added, I would 
    like to let you know that drafting manuals are very 
    dreary to proofread. They are a delight to work 
    with in the real world, allowing you to save a bundle 
    on vintage patterns and to make recreations that 
    fit your own modern body, but they are a bear to 
    get from paper to web form. I am actively proofreading 
    the unending M. Rohr's 1957 <em>Pattern Drafting 
    &amp; Grading, Women's and Misses' Garment Design, 
    inluding junior's, sub-teens, teens, and half sizes,</em> 
    but it's slow going.</p>
  <h3><a name="2005" id="2005"></a>2005 to 2007</h3>
  <p>Life happens. Vintagesewing.info remains live but 
    no new works are added.</p>
  <h3><a name="2004" id="2004"></a>September 3, 2004</h3>
  <p>We have reconfigured the popup windows and made the page width a little narrower 
    so that large blocks of text will be easier to read. Whew! Now we can move 
    forward with adding new works to the site.</p>
  <h3>July 14, 2004</h3>
  <p>The new <a href="support.html">Support</a> page is up; we can now accept 
    monetary donations! The state of California has granted our tax-exempt status, 
    and we hope the IRS won't be far behind.</p>
  <p>We are continuing the next phase of our accessibility compliance and reconfiguring 
    the pop-up windows. We're up to the mid-1920's.</p>
  <p>It was brought to our attention that we somehow neglected to add the links 
    to the <a href="1950s/52-hmh/hmh-toc.html">Table of Contents</a> for <em>How 
    to Make Hats. </em>We've remedied that.</p>
  <h3>June 21, 2004</h3>
  <p>The new search engine is configured and working! If you have any difficulties 
    with it, please let us know.</p>
  <h3>June 18, 2004</h3>
  <p>In addition to <em><a href="1930s.html#31ldc">Principles of Tailoring </a></em> 
    (1931), we've added <em><strong>four</strong></em> millinery books: <em><a href="1950s.html#52hmh">How 
    to Make Hats</a></em> (1952), <em><a href="1930s.html#30mp">Millinery Processes</a></em> 
    (1930), <em><a href="1920s.html#25m">Millinery</a></em> (1925), and <em><a href="1920s.html#22m">Millinery</a></em> 
    (1922).</p>
  <p>To make it easier to browse, we've reorganized the <a href="candidates.html">Candidates</a> 
    page to sort by category instead of decade.</p>
  <h3>June 12, 2004</h3>
  <p>We outgrew our old host (they shut us down for four days last month for exceeding 
    our bandwidth&#8212;and here we thought that in the professional word you 
    <em>contact </em>your customer if there is a problem), so we have switched 
    hosts. If you notice any broken links or missing images or pages, please <a href="mailto:mmc@vintagesewing.info">let 
    us know</a> so we can fix it promptly. </p>
  <p>We are still settling in with the new host, so the search engine is temporarily 
    inactive. Once we untangle our database snarl, we should have the new-and-improved 
    version up and running before too long.</p>
  <h3>April 25, 2004</h3>
  <p>It has been a <em>very </em>busy couple of months and we apologize for the 
    delay in our publishing schedule. Last month we submitted to the state of 
    California our <a href="vsrl-art.html">Articles of Incorporation</a> as a 
    nonprofit public benefit corporation and we are jumping through the appropriate 
    hoops of red tape so we can apply for tax-exempt 501(c)3 status with the IRS 
    and accept donations to help this site continue to grow. We explain our reasons 
    for incorporating on the <a href="vsrl-faq.html">Corporate FAQ</a> page. </p>
  <p>In the midst of completing reams of forms, researching obscure state regulations 
    about charitable solicitations, and a minor site redesign to reflect our promotion 
    from hobby to separate legal entity, we have managed to complete the coding 
    of F. R. Morris' <a href="1940s.html#4xlgcm"><em>Ladies' Garment Cutting and 
    Making</em> (early 1940's)</a>. This book is an excellent followup to Peppin's 
    <a href="1940s.html#42mpd"><em>Modern Pattern Design</em> (1942)</a>, exploring 
    the creating of many more garments (including undergarments, evening gowns, 
    and coats and capes). There are also chapters on pattern grading, making up 
    the garments, tailoring, how to &quot;drape&quot; a pattern, and pattern grading 
    for the wholesale trade. The author explores the reasoning behind design decisions, 
    and has a few sharp words to direct to the &quot;cutters&quot; of the industry. 
  </p>
  <p>To help people browse the site, we've added a <a href="category.html">Category</a> 
    page. To let you know what books people have been voting for, we've added 
    a <a href="index-2.html#topfive">top-five list</a> on the main page. And in 
    response to repeated requests for more millinery books and <em>anything</em> 
    from the 19th century, we have a line on acquiring several such books and 
    will add them to the <a href="images/candidates.jpg">Candidates</a> page as 
    we process them. </p>
  <h3>January 25, 2004</h3>
  <p>You've got to love this new OCR software (ABBYY FineReader 6.0 Professional) 
    which has exponentially increased my output! Now completed are <em><a href="19th/1892-sn/sn-toc-long.html">School 
    Needlework </a></em><a href="19th/1892-sn/sn-toc-long.html">(1893)</a> and 
    <em><a href="1930s/31-ldc/ldc-toc.html">Laundering and Dry Cleaning</a></em><a href="1930s/31-ldc/ldc-toc.html"> 
    (1931)</a>. In answer to some repeated requests, we will be putting up a trio 
    of pattern drafting works next, starting with the hard-to-find <em>Ladies' 
    Garment Cutting and Making </em>(3rd ed., early 1940's), followed by the Rohr's 
    <em>Pattern Drafting &amp; Grading, Women's and Misses' Garment Design </em>(1957) 
    and the <em>Nu-Way Course in Pattern-Drafting</em> (1928).</p>
  <p>The <a href="candidates.html">Candidates</a> page has been updated to include 
    thumbnails of the covers. (And for those of you anxious to see some works 
    from the 19th century, I am exploring ways to use digital photography instead 
    of flatbed scanning so I won't damage the fragile older books available to 
    me from the University's library.)</p>
  <h3>January 18, 2004</h3>
  <p>Those of you who have been requesting books on millinery and glove making 
    will be happy to see that both <em><a href="1950s/50-hmg/hmg-toc.html">How 
    to Make Gloves</a></em><a href="1950s/50-hmg/hmg-toc.html"> (1950)</a> and 
    <em><a href="1920s/28-mhd/mhd-toc-long.html">Nu-Way Course in Millinery and 
    Hat Design </a></em><a href="1920s/28-mhd/mhd-toc-long.html">(1928)</a> have 
    been completed. Am now working on <em>School Needlework</em> (1893) which 
    will be followed by <em>Laundering and Dry Cleaning</em> (1931). Please continue 
    to visit the <a href="candidates.html">Candidates</a> page (updated whenever 
    I acquire new books) and submit your requests so I can try to publish the 
    more popular works first.</p>
  <h3>January 4, 2004</h3>
  <p><a href="1940s.html#42mpd"><em>Modern Pattern Design</em> (1942)</a> has 
    been completed! Beginning work on <em>How to Make Gloves</em> (1950).</p>

  <p>A few general directions for the cutting of garments are here given.</p>
  <p>A table or lap-board, large enough to lay the entire pattern upon, is required;
    also paper, sharp shears, weights, pins, tape-measure, needles, and thread.</p>
  <p>The first thing to be observed in cutting is whether the cloth has a right
    arid a wrong side. If it has a design, consider the heavier part as the bottom;
    a vine should run upwards; the nap on the cloth should run downwards.</p>
  <p>Before cutting, ascertain if there is sufficient cloth by laying the different
    parts of the pattern upon the cloth in such positions, that the cloth will
    not be unnecessarily wasted; being careful in regard to the up and down of
    the cloth. When there is a scarcity of material, the underneath parts of
    the sleeves may be pieced, hems may be faced, and the small pieces may often
    be used for the trimmings.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><strong><a href="illust/102.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,211);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/102-t.jpg" alt="Fig. 102&#8212;Wrapper" width="70" height="220" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em>The length of the main parts of a garment (as back, front, and sleeves)
    should be cut parallel to the selvedge or warp of the cloth. Fig. 102 represents
    a wrapper placed on cloth, which is folded lengthwise through the middle;
    the edge of the front is placed on the selvedge, and the back on the fold
    of the cloth, to avoid a seam at the back of the skirt. The vertical perforations
    in the side-back and both portions of the sleeve are placed lengthwise of
    the cloth. The perforations near the edges of the patterns show the seams,
    where alterations should be made. The perforations near the centre of the
    front indicate where the darts should be taken up.</p>
  <p>In cutting plain goods, two similar parts can be cut at once by folding
    either the right or the wrong sides together; the selvedges or edges of the
    material should first be pinned together to prevent slipping. When the cloth
    can not be doubled, great care must be taken not to cut similar parts (as
    sleeves) for the same side; this can always be avoided by laying one part
    upon the material, with either the right or wrong sides together.</p>
  <p>Having the cloth spread out evenly, place a weight or insert a pin at the
    middle of each part of the pattern. Smoothing out each part from the middle,
    pin it to the cloth, being careful to place pins closely at the middle of
    the darts, at the curves, and one at each corner of the pattern. Cut evenly
    and close to the edge of the pattern, and be very particular at the curves.    </p>
  <p>Linings should be cut and basted carefully on to the wrong side of the cloth,
      before cutting the cloth. The notches on the edges of the pattern should
      only be cut in the lining.</p>
  <p>In cutting linings or unlined garments, the marks for the seams may be made
    by a tracing-wheel, or they may be pricked with a large needle. Where there
    are perforations, a pencil or chalk may be used. When two parts of a garment
    are cut at once, especially on woolen materials, the following tailor's
    method of marking the perforations may be used,&#8212; pin the pattern securely
    through both-thicknesses of cloth. With a coarse, doubled thread take the
    first stitch in the centre of the perforation and through both thicknesses
    of cloth; take another stitch in the same place, and, in drawing the thread
    through, leave a loop the size of a pencil. At the next perforation make
    a similar stitch, leaving the thread loose between the perforations, and
    so continue, until all the perforations are marked. Then cut out the parts,
    separate the two edges of cloth, as far as the thread will permit, and carefully
    cut the threads midway between the two edges. Cut the long stitch on the
    upper side, in the middle, and remove the paper pattern. The threads left
    in the cloth serve as a guide for basting.</p>
  <p><strong>Matching</strong>&#8212; A plaided, striped, or figured cloth requires great care
    in cutting. If the breadths of a skirt made from a checked or evenly plaided
    material are cut off in the middle of a check, the breadths will readily
    match. In other plaids or designs, cut the lower edge of each breadth on
    the same line of the plaid or design. In cutting a garment, similar to a
    dress-waist, which opens in front, first decide what part of the plaid, stripe,
    or design will look best for the middle of the front and back. Then lay the
    pattern for the front on the cloth, so that the outer fold of the hem is
    one-eighth of an inch (or one-half of the width to be lapped) beyond the
    middle desired. Cut this side out, and cut the other half of the front, by
    laying the part already cut on the cloth, with the right sides together,
    and plaids or designs exactly matching. Lay the pattern for the back on the
    cloth, so that the back edge of the pattern is one-fourth of an inch beyond
    the middle desired; this allows for the seam. Cut the other half of the back
    as in cutting the second half of the front.</p>
  <p>In order to cut twilled material on the bias, with the twill perpendicular,
    the cloth must be folded at right angles to the twill. To do this, lay the
    cloth lengthwise on the table, with the right side downward, fold over the
    lower right-hand corner, and cut on the fold. Linings for broad hems or a
    curved edge (as a hat) should be cut on the bias (<a href="sn-01.html#11">see
    page 11</a>).</p>
  <p>Cotton cloth, calico, or flannel may be torn (<a href="sn-01.html#9">page
      9</a>), when a straight edge
    is required; linen should be cut by first drawing a thread (<a href="sn-03.html#116">page
    116</a>).</p>
  <p><strong>Drafting</strong>&#8212; The following rules for drafting are given as suitable
    in ordinary cases, but the drafter should use discretion in regard to personal
    taste and prevailing styles.</p>
  <p>In the illustrations, each square represents an inch. Dots are marked by
    letters, lines are marked by numbers. Remember that the dot is the important
    mark, the letter being but a name to the dot, and may be placed in any convenient
    position near the dot.</p>
  <h3><a name="apron" id="apron"></a>TWO-BREADTH APRON</h3>
  <p>A two-breadth apron, one yard long, having a four inch hem, requires two
    and one-fourth yards of material.</p>
  <p>1. Find half of the length of the material, tear across, or fold and cut
    on the fold.</p>
  <p>2. Fold the lengthwise edges of one of the pieces together.</p>
  <p>3. One and one-half inches each side of the fold, tear the entire length,
    or fold again one and one-half inches from the edge of the fold and cut both
    thicknesses of material on the last fold. This gives a strip for the binding
    and the two side-breadths.</p>
  <p><strong>Making</strong>&#8212; Sew the raw edges of the side-breadths to the front-breadth,
    thus avoiding a seam in the middle. If desired, hem the sides. Make a four
    inch hem at the lower edge, overhanding the ends of the hem before hemming.
    Gather the upper edge and put it into the band, being very careful to sew
    securely at the ends of the gathers, as this is where a strain comes. The
    fullness of the gathers depends upon the width of the material and the form
    of the person. Overhand the edges of the band together on each side of the
    gathers. If strings are desired, they should be cut before sewing the breadths
    together. Make a narrow hem at the sides of the strings, and a broader hem
    at the lower end. Gather, or lay small plaits, at the other end of the strings;
    insert them in the ends of the band, and hem the band over them.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><a name="bib" id="bib"></a><em><strong><a href="illust/103.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',366,799);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/103-t.jpg" alt="Fig. 103&#8212;Child's bib" width="220" height="98" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em>CHILD'S BIB</h3>
  <p>Take a piece of paper fifteen inches long and eleven inches wide.</p>
  <p>1. With the long side of the paper horizontally in front of you, write your
    name and school at the upper left-hand corner of the paper.</p>
  <p>2. Fold the lengthwise edges together, so that the name shows.</p>
  <p>3. With the folded edge towards you, make a dot at the right-hand end of
    the fold; mark it <em>A </em>(Fig. 103).</p>
  <p>4. On the fold, make a dot three inches from <em>A</em>; mark it <em>B</em>.</p>
  <p>5. At the right-hand end, two and one-fourth inches above <em>A</em>, make a dot;
    mark it <em>C</em>.</p>
  <p>6. Draw a light dash-line from <em>B</em> to <em>C</em>.</p>
  <p>7. Beyond the dash-line, draw a curved line from <em>B</em> to <em>C</em>, allowing three-fourths
    inch curve at the middle. Erase the dash-line.</p>
  <p>8. Cut on the curve.</p>
  <p><strong>Making</strong>&#8212; Make a narrow hem on the sides and on the straight edges
    at the top, and an inch hem at the lower edge. Bind the curve with narrow
    linen tape, leaving enough at each end for strings.</p>
  <h3><a name="pocket" id="pocket"></a>POCKETS</h3>
  <p>Take a piece of paper fifteen inches long and six inches wide.</p>
  <p>1. Place the narrow side of the paper horizontally in front of you.</p>
  <p>2. Write your name and school at the lower part of the paper.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><strong><a href="illust/104.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,469);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/104-t.jpg" alt="Figures 104 and 105&#8212;Pockets" width="150" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em>3. Make a dot six inches from the lower left-hand corner; mark it <em>A</em> (Fig.
    104).</p>
  <p>4. Make a dot one inch to the left of the upper right-hand corner; mark
    it <em>B</em>.</p>
  <p>5. Make a dot four inches exactly below <em>B</em>; mark it <em>C</em>.</p>
  <p>6. Draw from<em> A </em>to <em>C</em>.</p>
  <p>7. Draw from <em>B</em> to <em>C.</em></p>
  <p>8. Cut on the outer lines.</p>
  <p><strong>Making</strong>&#8212; When the skirt is made of wash material,
    make the pocket of the same; for woolen material, use strong silesia or cambric.
    Place the
    longest side of the pattern on a lengthwise fold of the material, and then
    cut. When the pocket is made of material different from the skirt, each bias
    edge should have a facing, two inches wide, like the material of the skirt.
    Baste the facings at the outside edges, and hem them at the inner edges.</p>
  <p>Fold the edges of the pocket together, with the facings on the outside.
    Beginning one-fourth of an inch below <em>A</em> (Fig. 104), make a French seam at
    the side and across the lower edge of the pocket. On the bias edge measure
    six inches from the seam, and from this point, stitch to <em>C</em> (Fig. 104). Turn
    the pocket inside out. In a seam of the skirt, beginning four and a half
    inches from the binding (this distance depends upon the length of the arm),
    make a slit six inches long, and fasten each end securely. With the facing
    of the pocket to the right side of the skirt, place the lower seams exactly
    together; baste, and stitch the pocket in. After overcasting, turn the pocket.
    Fold the edges in from <em>B</em> to <em>C</em> and overhand them. Lay a small plait at the
    upper end of the pocket, and tack it securely to the binding.</p>
  <p>Fig. 105 shows another way of cutting a pocket, which is to be inserted
    in the opening of the skirt between <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>.</p>
  <h3><a name="childs" id="childs"></a>CHILD'S DRAWERS (AGE, 8 YEARS)</h3>
  <p>Take a piece of paper twenty-two inches long and fourteen inches wide.</p>
  <p>1. Place the narrow side of the paper horizontally in front of you.</p>
  <p>2. Write your name and school two inches from the left-hand side of the
    paper, and eight inches above the lower edge. Under the name of the school,
    put in a column the words, waist measure, twenty-two inches; leg measure,
    seventeen inches; knee measure, thirteen inches.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><strong><a href="illust/106.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,391);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/106-t.jpg" alt="Figures 106&#8212;Child's drawers" width="124" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em>3. Mark the upper left-hand corner <em>A</em>, the upper right-hand corner <em>B</em>, the
    lower left-hand corner <em>C</em>, and the lower right-hand corner <em>D</em> (Fig. 106).</p>

  <p>5. Make a dot two inches above <em>D</em>; mark it <em>F</em>.</p>
  <p>6. Draw a dash-line from <em>E</em> to <em>F</em>.</p>
  <p>7. Fold the paper under on the line; this is for the hem.</p>
  <p>8. Make a dot seven and one-half inches above <em>F</em>; mark it <em>G</em>.</p>
  <p>9. Make a dot three inches below <em>A</em>; mark it <em>H</em>.</p>
  <p>10. Make a dot four inches to the left of <em>B</em>; mark it <em>I</em>.</p>
  <p>11. Draw a line from <em>H</em> to<em> I</em>.</p>
  <p>12. Draw a line from <em>G</em> to <em>I</em>.</p>

  <p>14. Draw a light dash-line from <em>G</em> to <em>J</em>.</p>
  <p>15. Draw an inward-curving line from <em>G</em> to <em>J</em> allowing one-inch curve in the
    middle. Erase the dash-line.</p>
  <p>16. Without unfolding the hem, cut the pattern on the outside lines.</p>
  <p><strong><a name="139" id="139"></a>Making</strong>&#8212; For drawers this size, one and one-fourth
    yards of material are required. Fold the cloth lengthwise fourteen inches
    from one of the edges,
    and pin the thicknesses of cloth together at the selvedge edge. Unfold the
    hem, and lay the longest edge of the pattern on the fold, <em>with the lower
    edge at the raw edge of the cloth</em>. Carefully pin the pattern on, and
    then cut. Remove the pattern, lay it on the other end of the cloth in the
    same
    manner, and cut the other leg. For an opening at the side, cut a slit on
    each fold seven and one-half inches deep. Cut two lengthwise bindings, each
    three inches wide and twelve inches long. The lower edge is cut by a thread;
    begin there to baste, and, if one side proves a little longer than the other,
    pare it off. Sew each leg as far as <em>G</em> (Fig. 106). Place the right
    sides of the legs together, with the seams exactly meeting. Turn one seam
    to the right,
    and the other to the left, and pin. Beginning at <em>G</em>, sew the upper
    portions together. Fold and sew the hem of each leg. At the side openings,
    make narrow
    hems and set in gussets. If preferred, the openings may be faced or bound.
    Leaving two inches at each end, gather each side, and put on the bindings,
    allowing more fullness at the middle.</p>
  <h3><a name="yoke" id="yoke"></a>NIGHT-DRESS YOKE (BUST MEASURE, 32 INCHES)</h3>

    backs at once. With the right sides of the cloth folded together, lay the
    lower edge of the sleeve pattern on a woof thread of the cloth, and cut two
    sleeves at once. Lay the narrow edge of the cuff pattern on a woof thread
    of the cloth, and cut one cuff; cut the other cuff in a similar manner. Baste
    an inch and a half hem at each side of the opening in the back; baste the
    side and shoulder-seams together, allowing half-an-inch seam. Try the tier
    on, make any alterations necessary, and then sew the seams. Make an inch
    hem at the lower edge. Sew each sleeve together, making a narrow seam. Gather
    the upper edge of each sleeve, leaving a space of two inches each side of
    the seam. Gather the lower edge of each sleeve, leaving a space of an inch
    and a half each side of the seam. Sew the narrow edges of each cuff together.
    Holding the right sides together stitch the cuffs to the sleeves. Fold the
    cuffs over, and hem on the wrong side at the stitching. Holding the sleeve
    towards you, with the upper part of the sleeve marked <em>M</em> (Fig. 108)
    towards the front, and with the notch at the shoulder-seam, sew the sleeve
    in. Bind
    or face the neck. Make the button-holes, and put on the buttons. If strings
    are desired make them each three inches wide and three-fourths of a yard
    long; laying a plait, insert the strings into the side-seams five inches
    below the arm-scye.</p>

  <p><strong>Making</strong>&#8212; In a gored skirt, the bias edges should
    be towards the back. Place the straight edges of the side-breadths to the
    front-breadth, and pin
    them together at the ends and in the middle. In sewing the seams, hold the
    bias edge towards you, fulling it a little if necessary; or the bias edge
    can be held smoothly, afterwards cutting off the extra length at the lower
    edge. Sew the back-breadth to the side-breadths in a similar manner. Make
    a four inch hem at the lower edge, laying a small plait at each seam for
    the fullness In the middle of the back-breadth make a placket ten inches
    in length. Put the upper edge into the band, allowing more fullness at the

  <h3><a name="basque" id="basque"></a>HINTS FOR A PLAIN BASQUE</h3>
  <p>There are over four hundred different systems of dress-drafting used in
    the United States, and any one of these to be of use requires constant practice.</p>
  <p>Patterns are now easily obtained, and by using judgment and following the
    given directions carefully, will be found of great assistance. Patterns allowing
    for seams are easier to cut from, than those which do not.</p>
  <p>The trimmings needed for a plain basque are linings, sewing silk, button-hole
    twist, basting cotton, buttons or hooks and eyes, and whale-bones.</p>
  <p>The main parts of a plain basque pattern are front, back, side-back, under-arm,
    collar, upper-sleeve, and under-sleeve.</p>
  <p>The front pattern can be distinguished from the back pattern by the shape
    of the neck and arm-scye, the neck of the front being cut lower, and the
    arm-scye being cut larger and having more of a curve. The upper-sleeve portion
    is wider than the under-sleeve portion, in order to bring the seams more
    under the arms.</p>
  <p>The edge of the hem of the opening should be laid on the selvedge, to avoid
    making two folds in the hem.</p>
  <p>Great care must be taken to baste the seams of a basque according to the
    marks; few beginners realize that the difference of an eighth of an inch
    in the width of the seven seams, around the waist, will amount to one and
    three-fourths inches. Even basting stitches should be used. After the basque
    is basted, try it on. Alterations for tightening or loosening the basque,
    around the waist, should be made at the under-arm seams.</p>
  <p>After the seams are sewed, take out the bastings; pare the seams, making
    notches at the waist-line, and two inches above the waist-line, to allow
    for the curving of the dress. The under-arm seams may be left wider than
    the others, that the basque may be let out.</p>
  <p>Press the seams open. Overcast the seams closely, or bind them with a narrow
    silk binding obtainable for this purpose.</p>
  <p>Whale-bone casings can be bought, or a bias strip of silesia can be sewed
    on to the seams, fulling it a little. Soak the whale-bones in hot water for
    an hour, before using, which will render them soft and pliable enough to
    sew through. They should be firmly fastened an inch above and an inch below
    the waist-line.</p>

    muslin, two inches wide, on the edge of the basque; then fold the edges over
    half-an-inch, and catch them to the lining, fastening securely at the seams.
    Put on a facing of a thin material cut on the bias.</p>

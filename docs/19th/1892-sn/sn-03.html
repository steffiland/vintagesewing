  <h3><a name="hem" id="hem"></a>HEM-STITCH</h3>
  <p>Hem-stitching is a method of hemming, in which the threads of the cloth
    are drawn and separated.</p>
  <p><strong>Materials</strong>&#8212; No. 8 needle, No. 50 thread, and a lengthwise strip of
    linen crash.</p>
  <p><strong>Hem-stitch, from right to left</strong>&#8212;</p>
  <p>1 One inch from a lengthwise edge of the cloth, draw out from four to six
    threads (<a href="#suggestions">see suggestions</a>) according to the coarseness of the cloth.</p>
  <p>2. Carefully baste the hem to the line thus drawn.</p>
  <p>3. Begin at the right-hand side, as for hemming.</p>
  <p>4. Pointing the needle towards you, take up three or four cross-threads,
    and draw the thread through.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><strong><a href="illust/087.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',418,637);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/087-t.jpg" alt="Fig. 87&#8212;Showing hem-stitching done from right to left, needle in position." width="220" height="125" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em>5. Put the needle back, take up the same threads, and insert the needle
    exactly above in the fold of the hem (Fig. 87).</p>
  <p>6. Continue in the same manner, drawing the thread tight, to separate the
    cross-threads.</p>
  <p><strong><a name="116" id="116"></a>Hem-stitch, from left to right</strong>&#8212;</p>
  <p>1. Draw the threads, and baste the hem as before.</p>
  <p>2. Fasten the thread in the hem, at the left-hand side.</p>
  <p>3. Pointing the needle towards you, take up three or four cross-threads.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><strong><a href="illust/088.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',443,648);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/088-t.jpg" alt="Fig. 88&#8212;Showing hem-stitching done from left to right, needle in position." width="220" height="129" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em>4. Draw the needle through, and insert it in the fold of the hem exactly
    above where it was inserted under the cross-threads (Fig. 88).</p>
  <p>5. Continue in the same manner, drawing the thread tight.</p>
  <p><strong><a name="suggestions" id="suggestions"></a>Suggestions</strong>&#8212; To draw the threads, choose a coarse
    thread, one-fourth of an inch from the edge, and pick it out with the point
    of the needle. Holding
    this end with the right hand, draw it out carefully, continually pushing
    the gathers towards the opposite end with the left hand. Should the thread
    break, hold the cloth to the light, and again pick out the end of the thread.
    The chief difficulty is in drawing the first thread. Threads can be drawn
    any width desired.</p>
  <p>Hem-stitching can be done either lengthwise or crosswise of the cloth. On
    fine materials, do not count the threads, as it is too great a strain on
    the eyes, and for this reason, school-girls should not do much drawn-work.</p>
  <h3><a name="catch" id="catch"></a><a name="117" id="117"></a>CATCH OR HERRINGBONE-STITCH</h3>
  <p>Catch-stitch is a kind of cross-stitch, used to secure the edges of flannel.</p>
  <p><strong>Materials</strong>&#8212; A long-eyed needle, a knot of split zephyr, and a piece
    of canvas.</p>
  <p><strong>Catch-stitch</strong>&#8212;</p>
  <p>1. Work from you, holding the canvas over the left forefinger.</p>
  <p>2. Insert the needle from underneath, at the lower left-hand corner.</p>
  <p>3. From the place where the zephyr comes out, count to the right four threads,
    then forward four threads; insert the needle, and pointing it towards you
    take up two threads.</p>
  <p><a name="118" id="118"></a>4. From the place where the zephyr comes out, count to the left four threads,
    then forward four threads, and take up two threads as before.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em></em><em><strong><a href="illust/089.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,299);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/089-t.jpg" alt="Fig. 89&#8212;Showing catch-stitches, and the needle in position; the straight lines represent the threads of the canvas." width="73" height="177" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em>5. Continue in the same manner, making<em></em> the <em></em>stitches to the right, then to
    the left; the zephyr crossing diagonally (Fig. 89).</p>
  <p>6. Notice that the little cross at one side, comes between the crosses on
    the opposite side, and that the needle comes out on a line with its insertion
    for the previous stitch.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em></em><em><strong><a href="illust/090.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,428);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/090-t.jpg" alt="Fig. 90&#8212;Showing a corner turned, and the needle in position for turning a corner." width="122" height="186" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em>7. Tur<em></em>n the corner, by taking a stitch at the left, insert the needle at
    the right, and pointing it towards the left, take up two threads (Fig. 90).
    Turn the canvas, and holding the next side across the left forefinger, continue
    as before (Fig. 90).</p>
  <p><strong>Suggestions</strong>&#8212; In catch-stitching on flannel, small knots may be made
    if they can be concealed. When ending, fasten the thread by running it in
    and out under the last stitch. The thread can be fastened in beginning and
    finishing, by leaving an end to be sewed over and over with fine cotton on
    the wrong side.</p>
  <p>The raw edge of a hem on woolen material may be fastened by catch-stitches,
    to avoid the ridge formed by folding the edge. The edges of a seam in flannel
    may be fastened in several ways; the seam may be folded to one side, and
    the edges fastened by a row of catch-stitches; the seam may be opened and
    each edge fastened separately; or, with the seam opened, a row of catch-stitches
    may be put in the middle.</p>
  <h3><a name="feather" id="feather"></a>FEATHER-STITCH</h3>
  <p>Feather-stitching is used for ornamenting garments, etc.</p>
  <p><strong>Materials</strong>&#8212; A long-eyed needle, a knot of split zephyr, and a piece
    of canvas.</p>
  <p><strong>Feather-stitch</strong>&#8212;</p>
  <p>1. Work towards you, holding the canvas over the left forefinger.</p>
  <p class="clear"><strong><em><a href="illust/091.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,713);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/091-t.jpg" alt="Fig. 91&#8212;(a) Showing single feather-stitchese, taken on a line with the threads of the cloth; (b) showing double feather-stitches, taken on a line with the threads of the cloth; (c) showing single feather-stitches, taken slanting across the threads of the cloth; (d) showing double feather-stitches, taken slanting across the threads of the cloth; (e) showing treble feather-stitches, taken slanting across the threads of the cloth." width="214" height="144" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em></strong>2. Draw the needle through from underneath at the upper left-hand corner
    (Fig. 91, <em>b</em>).</p>
  <p>3. From the place where the zephyr comes out, count two threads to the right,
    insert the needle, and pointing it towards you take up two threads of the
    canvas.</p>
  <p>4. Draw the needle out over the zephyr, which is held down by the thumb.</p>
  <p>5. From the place where the zephyr comes out, count two threads to the right,
    and take a stitch as before.</p>
  <p>6. From the place where the zephyr comes out, count two threads to the left,
    and take a stitch, being careful to hold the zephyr down with the thumb.</p>
  <p>7. From the place where the zephyr comes out, count two threads to the left,
    and take another stitch.</p>
  <p>8. Continue taking the stitches in this way (Fig. 91, b).</p>
  <p><strong>Suggestions</strong>&#8212; For fastening the thread see catch-stitching (<a href="#118">page
      118</a>).
    This stitch may be changed into various designs, as in Fig. 91. Whatever
    the pattern, the stitches should be compact and uniform.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><a name="chain" id="chain"></a>CHAIN-STITCH</h3>
  <p><strong><em><a href="illust/092.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,263);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/092-t.jpg" alt="Fig. 92&#8212;Showing chain-stitches, needle in position." width="65" height="183" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em></strong>Chain-stitching is a method of embroidering, by which the stitches resemble
    a chain.</p>
  <p><strong>Materials</strong>&#8212; An embroidery needle, embroidery silk, and a strip of
    cloth.</p>
  <p><strong>Chain-stitch</strong>&#8212;</p>
  <p>1. Work towards you, holding the cloth over the left forefinger.</p>
  <p>2. Draw the needle through from underneath at the upper end, a short distance
    from the edge.</p>
  <p>3. Holding the thread to the left with the thumb, insert the needle where
    the thread comes out, and bring it 
    through one-eighth of an inch below, and over the thread to form the loop. </p>
  <p>4. Continue in this manner, always inserting the needle inside the loop
    of the last stitch, and being careful to take the same number of threads
    on the needle for each stitch.</p>
  <p><strong>Suggestion</strong>&#8212; Chain-stitching is often used for outlining
    a pattern.</p>
  <h3><a name="kens" id="kens"></a>KENSINGTON OUTLINE-STITCH</h3>
  <p>Kensington outline-stitching is done by taking a long stitch forward on
    the upper side, and a short stitch backward on the under-side of the cloth,
    and is used to form a line for ornament.</p>
  <p><strong>Materials</strong>&#8212;An embroidery needle, embroidery silk, and a strip of cloth.</p>
  <p><strong>Kensington outline-stitch</strong>&#8212;</p>
  <p>1. Work from you, holding the cloth over the left forefinger.</p>
  <p>2. Draw the needle through from underneath, at the lower end.</p>
  <p> class="clear"<strong><em><a href="illust/093.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,322);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/093-t.jpg" alt="Fig. 93&#8212;Showing Kensington outline-stitches, needle in position." width="85" height="184" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em></strong>3. Insert the needle one-eighth of an inch above, and two or three threads
    to the right, bringing it out at the left one-sixteenth of an inch above
    the place where the thread comes through the cloth (Fig. 93).</p>
  <p>4. Continue in this way, keeping the thread to the right of the needle,
    and being careful not to draw the stitches tight.</p>
  <p><strong>Suggestions</strong>&#8212; Some prefer keeping the thread to the left of the needle.
    Stem-stitching is similar to outline-stitching, except that the needle is
    put farther back.</p>
  <h3><a name="blanket" id="blanket"></a>BLANKET-STITCH</h3>
  <p>Blanket-stitching is used to secure and ornament the edges of woolen material.</p>
  <p><strong>Materials</strong>&#8212; An embroidery needle, embroidery silk, and a strip of
    flannel.</p>
  <p><strong>Blanket-stitch</strong>&#8212;</p>
  <p>1. Work from left to right, holding the edge of the flannel towards you.</p>
  <p>2. Beginning at the corner, insert the needle one-fourth of an inch from
    each edge, and take two running stitches to the edge, leaving an end of the
    thread to be cut off afterwards. This brings the thread in position for working.</p>
  <p>3. Holding the thread under the left thumb, put the needle in where it was
    first inserted.</p>
  <p class="clear"><strong><em><a href="illust/094.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',393,508);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/094-t.jpg" alt="Fig. 94&#8212;Showing blanket-stitchese, needle in position" width="220" height="168" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em></strong>4. Draw the needle through and over the thread (Fig. 94).</p>
  <p>5. Holding the thread down with the thumb, insert the needle one-fourth
    of an inch to the right, and parallel with the previous stitch.</p>
  <p>6. Draw the needle through, and over the thread, being careful that the
    thread lies loosely on the edge of the flannel.</p>
  <p>7. Continue in this manner.</p>
  <p>8. To fasten the thread, turn to the wrong side, take a running stitch under
    the last blanket-stitch. Draw the thread through, and cut it off.</p>
  <p>9. To join the thread, put the needle in under the last stitch, as in beginning
    the work, and draw it out over the thread that lies along the edge.</p>
  <p class="clear"><strong><em><a href="illust/095.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',253,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/095-t.jpg" alt="Fig. 95&#8212;Showing blanket-stitches taken in different forms." width="220" height="64" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Suggestions</strong>&#8212; If the thread
    is not fastened and joined carefully, the symmetry of the stitches will be
    broken. The order of the stitches
    may be varied by taking them at different depths, and leaving spaces between,
    as in Fig. 95.</p>
  <p class="clear"><strong><em><a href="illust/096.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',466,677);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/096-t.jpg" alt="Fig. 96&#8212;Showing a border of blanket-stitches, needle in position" width="220" height="149" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em></strong>A pretty border can be made with this stitch (Fig. 96), by making the first
    row the desired width from the edge, and taking the stitches for the second
    row through those of the first row, and so on.</p>
  <h3><a name="knots" id="knots"></a>EMBROIDERY KNOTS</h3>
  <p>Embroidery knots are used for ornamentation.</p>
  <p><strong>Materials</strong>&#8212; An embroidery needle, embroidery, silk, and a piece of
    flannel.</p>
  <p><strong>Embroidery knot No. 1</strong>&#8212;</p>
  <p>1. Holding the flannel over the left forefinger, draw the needle through
    from underneath, at the place desired for the knot.</p>
  <p>2. Take a <em>small</em> backstitch leaving the needle half-way through the flannel.</p>
  <p class="clear"><strong><em><a href="illust/097.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',737,384);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/097-t.jpg" alt="Fig. 97&#8212;Showing embroidery knot No. 1, and the needle in position" width="90" height="171" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em></strong>3. Take the silk, where it comes through the flannel, and wind it twice
    around the needle (Fig. 97).</p>
  <p>4. Holding the coil under the left thumb, draw the needle through and insert
    it where it came through the flannel, bringing it out where the next knot
    is to be made.</p>
  <p><strong>Embroidery knot No. 2</strong>&#8212;</p>
  <p>1. Holding the flannel over the left forefinger, draw the needle through
    from underneath, at the place desired for the knot.</p>
  <p class="clear"><strong><em><a href="illust/098.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',739,404);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/098-t.jpg" alt="Fig. 98&#8212;Showing embroidery knot No. 2, and the needle in position." width="93" height="174" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em></strong>2. Draw the silk towards you to the left; holding it under the thumb, bring
    the silk to the right, and cross below where the silk came out of the flannel
    (Fig. 98, <em>a</em>). Hold the loop thus formed under the thumb.</p>
  <p>3. Insert the needle one or two threads back of a, bring it out at <em>a</em>, and
    pass it through the loop (Fig. 98).</p>
  <p>4. Draw the needle and silk out straight upwards.</p>
  <p>5. Insert the needle again at <em>a</em>, and bring it out where the next knot is
    to be made.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><a name="mark" id="mark"></a>MARKING</h3>
  <p>Page 126 consists<strong><em><a href="illust/lc-reg.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',493,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/lc-reg-t.jpg" alt="Lower-case cross-stich" width="220" height="130" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em></strong> of<strong><em><a href="illust/up.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',484,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/up-t.jpg" alt="Upper-case cross-stitch" width="220" height="128" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em></strong> capital letters; page 127 consists of small letters
    and upright numerals; page 128 consists of small letters, suitable for fine
    material, and slanting numerals.</p>
  <p>The material, thread and needle should correspond. The marking stitch consists
    of a cross-stitch taken over two threads of the canvas. To make the stitch,
    draw the needle through from underneath at the <em>lower right</em>-hand corner of
    the square for the stitch; insert the needle at the <em>upper left</em>-hand corner,
    bringing it out at the <em>lower left</em>-hand corner; insert the needle at the <em>upper
    right</em>-hand corner, and bring it out at the <em>lower right</em>-hand corner of the
    next stitch.</p>
  <p class="clear"><strong><em><a href="illust/lc.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',492,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/lc-t.jpg" alt="Lower-case cross-stich" width="220" height="130" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em></strong>Make no knots, but leave an end of the thread to be worked over with the
    first stitches, or it can afterwards be run in and out under the letter.
    Fasten the thread in the same manner. The stitches should all be crossed
    the same way; the thread should be fastened after finishing a letter, not
    carried from one to another. Have the back of the work look neat.</p>
  <p>When marking on canvas is understood, fine material can be easily marked,
    by basting a piece of scrim over the place to be worked, and, after taking
the stitches, drawing out the threads of the scrim.</p>

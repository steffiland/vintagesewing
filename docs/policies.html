<h2><a name="privacy" id="privacy"></a>Privacy Policy</h2>
<h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>
<h4>Notification of New Works</h4>
<p>The email address submitted by the user to <a href="subscribe.htm">sign up</a> for
  notification of new works is used only to send email when a new work is published
  on this site,
  the frequency of which varies from biennially to seasonally to monthly, depending
  on how productive we are. The email addresses are used for that purpose only,
  and
  not disclosed.</p>
<h4>Cookies</h4>
<p>In
  an internet or computer context, a cookie is a piece of data stored on
  the user's computer tied to information about the user. Cookies are not used
  on
  this site. (The  small flat sweet cake variety of cookies, however, 
are often eaten while working on this site.)</p>
<h4>Log Files</h4>
<p>Nearly all web site servers use log files to report activity. Logs usually
  include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider
  (ISP) in the form of a DNS (Domain Name System) number, referring/exit pages,
  platform type, and date/time stamp. They can be used to check for things like
  what caused someone to receive a 404 error (page not found),
  find
  which
  pages are
  most
  visited,
  and see <a href="vsrl-stats.html">which search keywords</a> were used to find the site. The information (such
  as IP addresses) is not linked to personally identifiable information.</p>
<h4>External Links</h4>
<p>The links to other sites will lead to sites with their own privacy policies.
  This privacy statement applies solely to information collected (described above)
  by this web site.</p>
<h4>Notification of Changes</h4>
<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this
  privacy statement, and to the <a href="new.html">What's
New</a> page so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how
we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.</p>
<h2><a name="accessibility" id="accessibility"></a>Accessibility Statement</h2>
<p>We strive to keep this site in compliance with the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/">W3
    Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines</a> and the <a href="http://www.section508.gov/">U.S.
Federal Government Section 508 Guidelines</a>. This  includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Supplying description
    ALT tags for all images, and null ALT attributes for purely decorative elements.
    ALT tags provide information about images to viewers who are visually challenged
    or are using text-based browsers.</li>
  <li>Using  valid XHTML 1.0 Transitional and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets).
    CSS allow you to separate content from layout. If your browser does not support
    CSS, this site is still readable and navigable (just not as pretty).</li>
  <li>Using structured semantic markup so page titles are marked by H1 tags,
    subtitles by H2 tags, and sub-subtitles by H3 tags. This allows users of
    JAWS (a screen reader
    for Windows) to skip to the next subtitle.</li>
  <li>Removing unnecessary javascript. Formerly, we used javascript rollovers
    for the navigation arrows; now, we rely on the CSS rollover feature.</li>
  <li>Including a link to skip the navigation menu and jump to the main content.</li>
  <li>Not duplicating link text; two links with the same
    link text always point to the same address.</li>
  <li>Including link descriptions, especially if a link will take you off this
    site.</li>
  <li>Using tables for data, not for layout.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you find something we've overlooked (a missing alt tag, or duplicate link
  text, for example), please <a href="mailto:compliance@vintagesewing.info">let
  us know</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="mission" id="mission"></a>Mandatory Mission Statement</h2>
  <p>VintageSewing.info is the publishing site of the Vintage Sewing Reference Library, 
    Inc. a nonprofit public benefit corporation which publishes public domain 
    vintage sewing, fashion, and lifestyle books and images, rescuing primary 
    source reference material from obscurity to freely share with anyone who searches 
    for it. We especially want to provide this information to recreationists and 
    costumers so they can make design and construction choices from knowledge, 
    not ignorance.</p>
<h2><a name="copyright" id="copyright"></a>Copyright Issues and Public Domain</h2>
<p>Ah, what a complicated and constantly changing issue. Copyright is a right
  established by Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution to <q>&quot;promote
  the progress of science and useful arts by securing for limited times to authors
  and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.</q>&quot;
This &quot;limited time&quot; has been continually extended by congress, and is currently
  running at 95 years. Public domain refers to those works whose copyright has
  expired. </p>
<p>This site is based in the United States, so we comply with the U.S. Copyright
  law. A good overview of copyright duration can be found in the <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ15a.html" title="external link to U.S. Office of Copyright's Circular 15a">U.S. Government Copyright Office's <em>Circular 15a</em></a>. The short story is that works published with notice of copyright or registered in unpublished form prior to January 1, 1964 had to be renewed during the 28th year of their first term of copyright to maintain protection for a full 95-year term. </p>  <p>The works published on this site are, to the best 
    of our knowledge, in the public domain. This means 
    we have checked the <em>Catalog of Copyright Entries</em> 
    (usually available at major universities; some years 
    are available online) for renewal notice and did 
    not find one. If you hold the renewal certificate 
    for any of these works and wish either to have them 
    removed from the site, or simply to have your copyright 
    acknowledged, please contact us; upon receiving 
    a copy of the renewal certificate, we will comply.</p>
  <div class="main">
    <p>There is a misperception that because the original 
      copy of the works published on this site are in 
      the public domain that this web site's renderings 
      of them are fair game for anyone to use in any 
      manner. The <em>original works</em> are in the 
      public domain; the VintageSewing.info version 
      of them is copyright by the Vintage Sewing Reference 
      Library, Inc. We exist to <em>freely</em> share 
      the information&#8212;emphasis on the FREE. As 
      the Creative Commons license explains in clear, 
      human, terms:</p>
    <p><em>You are free:</em></p>
  </div>
  <ul>
    <li> 
      <div class="main"><em>To Share &#8212; to copy, 
        distribute, display, and perform the work</em></div>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Under the following conditions:</em></p>
  <ul>
    <li> 
      <div class="main"><em>Attribution. You must attribute 
        the work in the manner specified by the author 
        or licensor (but not in any way that suggests 
        that they endorse you or your use of the work).</em></div>
    </li>
    <li> 
      <div class="main"><em>Noncommercial. You may not 
        use this work for commercial purposes.</em></div>
    </li>
    <li> 
      <div class="main"><em>No Derivative Works. You 
        may not alter, transform, or build upon this 
        work.</em></div>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Can I make it any more clear? You do NOT have permission 
    to repackage the information on this site to sell 
    it, or to charge admission or in any way impede 
    free access to it. This information is to be FREELY 
    shared. I encourage you to share it; you need only 
    include a link or text reference back to this site 
    so people can find their way here and see what other 
    information we have. If you choose to copy entire 
    passages or works to your own site, you must include 
    a clearly visible attribution on each page (for 
    example, <strong>the original web version of this 
    work can be found at <a href="index.html">VintageSewing.info</a></strong>). 
    You can use the images for noncommercial purposes; 
    if used on web sites, include an attribution and 
    link to us (for example, <em><strong>image courtesy 
    of <a href="index.html">VintageSewing.info</a></strong></em>). 
    You may use the images or information for your presentations 
    and include them in your local sewing guild's newsletters, 
    again, with an attribution. If you want to use any 
    of the images on items that will be sold, you need 
    explicit permission (<a href="mailto:mmc@vintagesewing.info">contact 
    me</a>). </p>
  <p>If this seems restrictive to you, you are free 
    to acquire an original print version of the work 
    for yourself, then scan it, OCR it, format and code 
    it, clean up the images, and do whatever you would 
    like with it. If you use anything published by Vintage 
    Sewing Reference Library, Inc., it must be under 
    the terms stated herein.</p>
  <h2><a name="typos" id="typos"></a>Why are there Typos in Some Works?</h2>
<p>The works published are, for the most part, reproduced without revisions to
  grammar or spelling. When orthography has been regularized, typographical errors
  corrected, or grammar changed, it has been noted in that work's &quot;typo&quot; document
  (listed with the work's summary on the appropriate &quot;decade&quot; page). If you are
  comparing an original copy of the work to that published on this site and find
  typographical
  errors
  that
  have
  not
  been
  annotated,
  please
  bring them to our
  attention and
  we will
  verify
  it
  is
  from
  the original
  work and annotate it.</p>

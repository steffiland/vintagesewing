  <h5><a name="select" id="select"></a>SELECTION OF EQUIPMENT</h5>
  <p>7. The selection of the articles that make up a laundry outfit is a subject
    that has much more import than is at first conceded. With the great number
    of labor-saving appliances that are from time to time put on the market,
    many of them presenting problems of mechanical apparatus, the question of
  which are the most practical and economical is one for consideration.</p>
  <p>8. An advertisement or a salesman will present the good points of the articles
    represented, and these good points, to be sure, should all be weighed carefully;
    but there are other factors also that enter into the final selection. The
    amount of money to be spent, the space that can be devoted to laundry work,
    and the amount of washing to be done, all play their part as determinant
    features. Consequently, the quantity of new equipment that would be suitable
    and possible in one family will vary from that in another family.</p>
  <p>9. Probably it is not necessary in some homes to invest in an entirely new
    laundry outfit. The old equipment may still be satisfactory with a little
    change. Perhaps the tubs have been at a back-breaking height, but will serve
    as well as new ones if reset properly. Or perhaps the resetting of the equipment
    will result in better light and the taking of fewer steps. Then, the remainder
    of the money to be spared for bettering laundry conditions can be put into
    adding a mangle, a drier, or some other device invented since this particular
    laundry was originally equipped.</p>
  <p>10. Following are suggestions as to the articles that are practical for
    the work of the home laundress and the materials that are on the market.
    This information should prove of value in helping you to make the selections
    that will bring the greatest amount of satisfaction possible from the well-equipped
    laundry.</p>
  <h5><a name="machines" id="machines"></a>WASHING MACHINES</h5>
  <p>11. <strong>Value of Machines</strong>.&#8212;Perhaps there is no device among those of the
    housekeeper which saves so much valuable time and takes out so much drudgery
    from housework as does the washing machine. Even the ever-necessary vacuum
    cleaner must give place to the priority of the washer, which, if self-running,
    works at one task, doing it well, while the housekeeper does something else.</p>
  <p>The real value of the washing machine must be computed in terms of time
    and energy saved, as well as in money. The actual investment takes into consideration
    the initial cost, the cost of operation and maintenance, and its approximate
    length of life. Another point to consider is the length of life of the materials
    that are washed. In considering this factor, remember that the machine in
    which friction is reduced to the minimum, saves wear and tear on the fabrics.</p>
  <p>12. <strong>Kinds of Machines</strong>.&#8212;There are a great many different washing machines
    in use, and each claims a very satisfactory method of cleaning. Therefore,
    before you purchase a washing machine, you should make a study of the types
    in general use and, if possible, have a demonstration of each.</p>
  <p>Of the types from which to make your choice, the four main ones are: the <em>&quot;dolly&quot; machine</em>,
    the <em>cylinder</em> or <em>rotary</em> machine, the <em>oscillating</em> or <em>rocker
    machine</em>, and the
    <em>pressure and suction machine</em>. Small-size washers of portable type are also
    available. All of these machines make use of some principle to force the
    dirt from the clothes into the soapy water. The principle may be <em>friction</em>,
    <em>agitation</em>, or <em>pressure and suction</em>; and the <em>motion</em> may be <em>rotary</em> or <em>revolving</em>,
    <em>oscillating</em> or <em>rocking</em>, and may be in one direction or reversible.</p>
  <p>The <em>motive power</em> may be <em>hand power</em>, <em>water power</em>, <em>gasoline
      engine</em>, or <em>electric
    motor</em>. Although there is no doubt that the power machine is an improvement
    over the hand-power machine, the choice of a machine should be based not
    on this alone, but also on its action and the effect it has on the clothes
    as well.</p>
  <p><a name="dolly" id="dolly"></a>13. The <strong>dolly</strong> type, which has a wooden dasher similar to
    a three-legged stool, cleans the clothes by rubbing them. The dasher revolves
    and reverses
    in the center of a tub, the sides of which are corrugated so that considerable
    friction results while the clothes 
    are rubbed against the sides of the tub. Since the action of this machine
    is mostly agitation and friction, it is best suited to the cleaning of heavy
garments and bedding, it being somewhat strenuous for dainty garments.</p>
  <p><a name="rotary" id="rotary"></a>14. In the <strong>cylinder</strong> or <strong>rotary</strong> type, the clothes are placed in the inner
    one of two drums or cylinders, which is perforated and has little shelves,
    or cleats, that lift the clothes and drop them so that water is forced through
    them. After a few revolutions, the action is reversed. Since no friction
    is caused by a rotary machine, it is a practical investment and will prove
    a saving of energy as well as of wear and tear on clothing.</p>
  <p><a name="oscillating" id="oscillating"></a>15. In the <strong>oscillating</strong> machine, there is a metal or wooden
    box, usually corrugated, which rocks back and forth and throws the 
    clothes from side to side in the motion of a figure 8, placed sidewise. The
    water is thus forced through them, and the cleaning accomplished by this
    process. This type of machine is satisfactory for general family washing,
    but when operated by motor power it is a little severe for dainty lingerie
    or
baby clothes unless they are first placed in a strong cheesecloth bag.</p>
  <p><a name="vacuum" id="vacuum"></a>16. The <strong>pressure and suction machine</strong>, usually known as the <strong>vacuum
      washer</strong>,
    is probably the best type of washer for fine laundering and is still efficacious
    for the heaviest and dirtiest of garments. The cleaning is accomplished by
    vacuum cups, or metal cones, 
    which change position with every downward stroke. The air contained in the
    cups forces the soapy water through the meshes of the garments on the down
    stroke, and on the up stroke, suction draws the water again through the meshes,
    carrying with it the soil.</p>
  <p><a href="illust/hl-06-04.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,517);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/hl-06-04-t.jpg" alt="Figure 4" width="166" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>The first mechanical application of the air pressure and suction principle
    of washing was made in 1878, when a hand plunger was 
    attached to a wooden tub. Since that time improvements have been made, gradually
    changing the washer into its present perfected form. Fig. 4 illustrates a
    modern, copper, electric washer of the vacuum type with wringer attached.
    The up-and-down motion of the cups is shown by the dotted lines.</p>
  <p>Another vacuum-cup machine has been invented, which is ideal from the standpoint
    of saving energy. The washer is so arranged that, when the clothes are clean,
    the whirling cylinder is flooded with clean water for rinsing. After rinsing,
    the water is drained off; then two or three minutes' additional whirling
    dries the clothes sufficiently for the line. Whirling the cylinder for a
    longer time makes the clothes ready for the ironing board without their being
    hung out at all. This is, of course, practical for rainy-day or apartment
    use.</p>
  <p>17. For the business woman, the mother of small children, and the homekeeper
    who has a supply of fine underthings and linens that require frequent laundering,
    one of the small, portable, electrically driven washers is an excellent investment.
    Their capacity is limited, but in many cases this is an advantage because
    of the ease with which the small washing may be done.</p>
  <p><a name="wood" id="wood"></a>18. Besides looking into the qualities of the various makes, consider also
    the relative merits of <strong>wood and metal machines</strong>. It is generally conceded
    that metal machines are more sanitary and hence more easily cared for than
    wooden ones. A simple scalding cleans a metal machine quite satisfactorily,
    whereas, with constant use, grime and bacteria are almost sure to collect
    in the fibers of the wooden machine. Wooden machines, moreover, warp and
    splinter after they have been used for some time.</p>
  <p>19. <strong>Care of the Washing Machine</strong>.&#8212;Much saving in repair bills and a
    longer period of usefulness are possible when tools are well cared for. Consequently,
    as an economic measure, the housewife will do well to apply any of the following
    suggestions that are in accordance with the kind of washer that she uses:</p>
  <ol>
    <li> Oil regularly where needed.</li>
    <li>Tighten the bolts, and keep the belts at
        the proper tension
    if the machine is motor-driven.</li>
    <li>Do not overload the machine. Fill it with
        water to the
      level designated and wash the proper weight of clothes
      for the particular machine in use. The weight varies with different makes
      and sizes. Pamphlets containing information about these matters can be
      obtained from the washing-machine dealers.</li>
    <li>After using, rinse the machine
        thoroughly with hot water,
      preferably by operating it for a minute. Drain and dry it. Drying metal
    machines prevents much discoloration.</li>
    <li><a name="19e" id="19e"></a>Use soap and water to remove grease
      or oil stains from the
      machine. Scouring powders should be used with care on
      metals to avoid injuring the surface. The following
    methods may be used with safety:
      <ul>
        <li><em> Aluminum</em>&#8212;Wash with hot, soapy water, as alkalis darken
        aluminum. </li>
        <li>          <em>Copper</em>&#8212;Rub with vinegar and a fine scourer,
          like whiting; polish with rottenstone mixed with oil; wash with soap
          and water; or wash with a preparation made by mixing
          1/2 cup of vinegar, 2 tablespoonfuls of salt, and 2 tablespoonfuls
          of kerosene. </li>
        <li><em> Nickel</em>&#8212;Moisten whiting with water or ammonia, rub,
          and wash with soap and water. </li>
        <li><em> Zinc</em>&#8212;Use the same treatment as for nickel. Hot vinegar
           may be used for obstinate stains.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>In a <em>wooden</em> washer, keep water to a depth of about 3 or 4 
    inches when the washer is put away after use. This prevents it from drying,
    warping, and leaking.</li>
    <li>Between wash-days, keep the lid of wood-tub machines open 1 or 2 inches
      to allow free circulation of the air.</li>
  </ol>
  <h5><a name="other" id="other"></a>OTHER EQUIPMENT</h5>
  <p><a href="illust/hl-08-05.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',569,492);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/hl-08-05-t.jpg" alt="Figure 5" width="172" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>20. <strong>Hand Plunger</strong>.&#8212;The hand plunger is really a miniature
    vacuum washer, consisting of a cone or an inverted funnel on a handle similar
    to a broom
    stick. Such a plunger, with detachable handle, is shown in Fig. 5. It is
    best employed as an aid in rinsing, since its use requires too much energy
    to consider it a satisfactory substitute for a washing machine. A portable
    tub set directly on the
floor provides the most comfortable way to use it.</p>
  <p><a name="tub" id="tub"></a>21. <strong>Tubs</strong>.&#8212;No matter what method of washing is followed
    or what other utensils are used, tubs, which are broad, open-topped vessels,
    are an essential
    in washing. They may be either portable, that is, capable of being moved
    from place to place, or stationary. 
    To obtain the desired results from tubs, whether stationary or portable tubs
    are to be used, thought should be given to the service that may be expected
from them as well as to the first cost.</p>
  <p class="clear"><strong><a href="illust/hl-09-06.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,500);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/hl-09-06-t.jpg" alt="Figure 6" width="160" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>Portable tubs</strong> are made of various kinds of materials, such as wood, galvanized
    iron, and fiber. They come also in a variety of sizes. A typical portable
    tub of galvanized iron is shown in Fig. 6.</p>
  <p><strong>Stationary tubs</strong> are generally made of soapstone, porcelain,
    or enameled iron. Those of white
    enameled iron have an advantage in that they reflect color readily and make
    it easy to detect rust or other stains, too much bluing, or bleeding of dyes
in colored clothes.</p>
  <p>22. The <em>height of the tub</em> should be considered to make comfortable working
    possible. In the securing of an easy height, place the tub sufficiently high
    so that the worker's back is straight and the forward bend is from the waist.
    Remember, too, that the working surface is not the bottom of the tub but
    the sloping side against which the washboard is placed, and take this into
    consideration in determining the desired height. Some authorities claim that
    a tub should be about 36 inches high for a woman 5 feet 5 inches tall, and
    others claim that this height is better for a woman 5 feet 3 inches tall,
    with an additional 1/2 inch added for each additional inch in height or subtracted
    for each inch under this average. These ratios, however, are only approximate,
    whether a woman has long or short arms or is long- or short-waisted largely
    determining the proper placement of a tub.</p>
  <p class="clear"><a href="illust/hl-10-07.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,534);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/hl-10-07-t.jpg" alt="Figure 7" width="171" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>23. <strong>Wash Benches</strong>.&#8212;In the use of portable tubs, a
    bench is needed to hold them. Fig. 7 shows the old-fashioned bench made 
    to hold two tubs. It is made in such a way that its presence on the back
    porch, when not in use, need not disturb the housewife who is endeavoring
to keep her porch attractive.</p>
  <p>A folding bench attached to a wringer standard is illustrated in Fig. 6.
    One side is shown folded up, while the other holds a tub and has its reversible
    drip board in position to transfer clothes from the wringer to the tub. Such
    a bench is highly satisfactory, as it not only is sturdy but also folds up
    into a small space.</p>
  <p><a name="washboards" id="washboards"></a>24. <strong>Washboards</strong>.&#8212;Boards on which clothes may be rubbed
    are made of brass, zinc, or glass, the one in Fig. 7 representing the general
    
    appearance of these various types. There is very little choice between the
    metal and the glass, so long as the metal has no sharp points that might
    catch and injure the fabrics, and the glass is not treated in such a way
    as to break it. The rougher, zinc boards remove dirt more quickly, but are
more likely to injure delicate fabrics.</p>
  <p>A new type of washboard has stiff bristles on the surface, over which the
    clothes are rubbed. If you have 
    used the small stiff-bristled brushes to clean soft collars and other especially
    soiled spots, you will readily understand the virtue of such a board.</p>
  <p>Small suction caps, made especially for the purpose and very inexpensive,
    may be purchased and attached securely to each foot of the board to keep
    it from sliding around in the tub.</p>
  <p><a name="wringer" id="wringer"></a>25. <strong>Wringers</strong>.&#8212;A clothes-wringer is an appliance having
    adjustable rollers, usually rubber covered, and used to press the water out
    of clothes
    after washing. Wringers come under various trade names and in different sizes,
    and each has its particular merit. 
    Also, they may be run by either motor or hand power. The kind that is clamped
    on to a tub is shown in Fig. 7, and the motor power type is shown in Fig.
    4. Be very careful in your selection of a wringer so as to obtain one that
    will give the greatest satisfaction for your particular needs. One with a
reversible drip board is best.</p>
  <p>Not only do wringers save time and energy, but they prevent a great deal
    of strain that would result if the material were hand wrung. To use a wringer
    correctly, take care to fold the garments evenly, turning all buttons to
    the inside. Also, be careful about the tension, as too tight pressure will
    make wrinkles that are hard to remove, and a little moisture left in the
    materials will leave more chance for the action of the sun and air.</p>
  <p>26. To lengthen the period of serviceability of a wringer, give it proper
    care. Oil it frequently, and remove any black grease that may have accumulated.
    Also, release the screws when the wringer is not in use so that the rollers
    will not become flat, remembering, when you tighten the rollers again for
    use, to turn the screws on both ends at the same time so as to make the pressure
    even.</p>
  <p>If a gummy substance collects on the rollers because of the use of hard
    water, remove it by rubbing them with a cloth dampened with kerosene. Then
    wash the rollers quickly with soap and water, as 
    kerosene is harmful to the rubber if allowed to remain on it. When not in
    use, besides loosening the tension, cover the wringer to protect it from
    dust.</p>
  <p class="clear"><a href="illust/hl-11-08.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',440,480);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/hl-11-08-t.jpg" alt="Figure 8" width="219" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a><a name="boiler" id="boiler"></a>27. <strong>Boilers</strong>.&#8212;Receptacles used for boiling clothes
    may be either round or oblong, the oblong being the more practical as they
    hold more clothes
    and fit the stove better. Fig. 8 shows an 
oblong boiler with a fitted cover that can be used or removed in sections.</p>
  <p>Boilers are made of tin, tin with copper bottom, and all copper. Those made
    of copper are preferable because of their superior wearing quality. Moreover,
    when they are used, there is less danger of the forming of rust spots on
    the clothing. Another point in their favor is that this metal transmits heat
    more readily than does tin. Do not make the mistake of boiling clothes in
    galvanized tubs, pans, 
    or buckets, as a scum, which is very difficult to remove from 
    clothes, often rises as a result of the contact with the galvanized 
    iron.</p>
  <p>Clothes-boilers may be preserved and kept free from stains by
the same methods as are recommended for washers in <a href="#19e">Art. 19 (5)</a>.</p>
  <p>28. <strong>Clothes-Baskets</strong>.&#8212;Baskets in which to carry wet clothes to the
    line are made in various sizes. In purchasing one, choose the proper size
    for your purpose and make sure of strong construction. Notice especially
    that there are no loose ends of the reed of which the basket is made, for
    dainty garments will catch on such rough ends and tear.</p>
  <p><em>Clothes-hampers</em> for holding soiled clothes until wash-day also are made
    in various styles and sizes and always have a cover. These hampers may be
    of reed, paper mache, or metal, the latter two kinds, of course, being more
    sanitary, provided they are properly ventilated. <em>Laundry bags</em> may be used
    instead of hampers, if desired.</p>
  <p><em>Clothes chutes</em> sometimes have a box built at the bottom to hold
    the clothes. Such boxes should always be at least 12 inches off the 
    floor, and should have a fine, latticed bottom and auger holes bored in the
sides to allow for ventilation.</p>
  <p>29. <strong>Clothes-Lines</strong>.&#8212;Clothes-lines may be of hemp
    rope, galvanized wire, or wire covered with cloth. Rope lines are the cheapest,
    and wire lines
    the most durable, although in time they are likely to become corroded and
    stain the clothes. Whatever the nature of the clothes-line, to lengthen its
    utility and to 
keep it clean, it should be taken in after every wash-day.</p>
  <p class="clear"><a href="illust/hl-12-09.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',516,485);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/hl-12-09-t.jpg" alt="Figure 9" width="188" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>In Fig. 9 is pictured a clothes-line that winds up inside of a metal container,
    which is attached to the wall. Its advantages can readily be seen, for it
    can be used indoors without taking up any room when not in use and it can
    be used outdoors with the same advantage and without accumulating dirt.</p>

    use are most satisfactory for securing clothes to clothes-lines, but there
    is also a wood
    and metal-wire clothes-pin that holds together firmly by 
    means of a spring and is advantageous for outdoor drying on a windy day.
The latter kind is shown in Fig. 10.</p>
  <p>It is very necessary that clothes-pins be kept clean; otherwise, they will
    leave black marks where they come in contact with wet. 
    materials. Frequent washing, therefore, is essential, as is also storing
    in dust-proof places. If a <em>clothes-pin apron</em> or <em>bag</em> or any other open receptacle
    is used, the top should be folded over or pulled 
    tight to keep all particles of dirt away from the clothes pins.</p>
  <p><a name="driers" id="driers"></a>31. <strong>Clothes-Driers</strong>.&#8212;Nothing is better than sun and air for the drying
    of clothes, but there are times when these agents are not available. For
    homes having very little outdoor space or for use indoors during stormy or
    freezing weather, clothes-driers of various types have been invented.</p>
  <p class="clear"><a href="illust/hl-13-11.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',561,644);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/hl-13-11-t.jpg" alt="Figure 11" width="220" height="187" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>One excellent type of drier for a small room is a light <strong>drying rack</strong> that
    can be pulled up against the ceiling where an oblong box holds it. For service
    in a small space, there are also several kinds and sizes of <strong>umbrella-shaped
    driers</strong>. Some are constructed so that a pole in the back yard supports
    their radiating arms in sunny weather, and sockets on the wall support the
    arms
    for service at other times. 
    One type, called the <strong>hill drier</strong>, is illustrated in Fig. 11. It folds up so
that a sack can be slipped over it to keep the rods clean when not in use.</p>
  <p>In the home where a fairly complete laundry is possible, a <strong>combination
      drier and stove</strong>, as shown in <a href="illust/hl-02-01.jpg">Fig.
      1</a>, is the most efficient. In such a drier, the
    heat passes through from the stove just as hot air passes 
    around the oven of a cook stove. The stove holds the wash boiler, the irons,
    and the starch kettle.</p>
  <p>32. Some homes contain a <strong>drying room</strong>, which is fitted with heating pipes
    and which is located adjoining the laundry or kitchen. With such a convenience,
    the one precaution necessary is to be sure to have the room well ventilated
    in order to carry off the steam, for 
    it is the congestion of steam in a drier that yellows clothes. The objection
    that an enclosed indoor drier does not keep clothes white is not true, if
    the drier is sufficiently ventilated and the clothes are adequately rinsed.</p>
  <p class="clear"><a href="illust/hl-14-12.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',503,553);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/hl-14-12-t.jpg" alt="Figure 12" width="220" height="199" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a><a name="ironing" id="ironing"></a>33. <strong>Ironing Boards</strong>.&#8212;In
    the selection of an ironing board, space and stability are the important
    considerations. The average homemaker may choose
    one of three types: a board made with a self-supporting stand that folds
    up, as shown in Fig. 12; a plain skirt board, which requires a table or support
    of some kind; or a board that is hinged
    to the wall and has a folding prop as a support. The latter kind can be concealed
behind a panel.</p>
  <p> If a new home is being planned, in which a whole basement room can be devoted
    to laundry equipment, there is probably no more satisfactory 
    ironing board made than the one on a metal standard which is set in the concrete
    floor. This eliminates entirely any possibility of a &quot;wobbly&quot; board.
    Some makes of these must be installed when the house is built, while others
can be added to any laundry room or space.</p>
  <p>Whatever kind the board is, it should be substantially built so that it
    stands firm. Also, it must be of the proper height for the worker. As practically
    all stands are adjustable, it is an easy matter to place the board at a height
    that will be correct for you. As you stand erect, have the board just high
    enough for the palm of your hand to lie flat on the board when your arm is
    held straight down without bending the elbow.</p>
  <p>Consider also the position of the supporting arm underneath, and choose
    a board that does not have arms so arranged that a skirt placed over the
    board has its lower edges rumpled by the time the ironing is completed.</p>
  <p>34. For <em>padding</em>, avoid a cushion-like surface, but have the board padded
    so that there will be no spring to it. Heavy felt or double-faced cotton
    flannel or silence cloth like that used on tables makes a good pad. Old blankets
    also make excellent coverings. Particular care is necessary to have no wrinkles
    in the padding, as 
    these leave undesirable shiny streaks on garments pressed over them, particularly
    wool garments.</p>
  <p>35. For the <em>ironing sheet</em> over the padding, new unbleached muslin that has
    been washed to remove all dressing, is very good, or worn sheets may be used,
    though they do not last long as a rule. One should have at least two ironing
    sheets so that they may be changed often, as frequent washing not only insures
    a clean board, but lengthens the life of the covering.</p>
  <p>The top covering should be large enough to cover the board entirely and
    lap over onto the under surface an inch or two. There are various ways of
    fastening, but preference should be given to the method that permits ease
    in changing the coverings and does not require much time. A very successful
    plan is to have brass or ivory rings sewed to one edge about 6 inches apart.
    Then, on the opposite edge at corresponding points, sew tapes with ends long
    enough to reach across under the board, through the rings, and tie.</p>
  <p class="clear"><a href="illust/hl-15-13.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,715);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/hl-15-13-t.jpg" alt="Figure 13" width="220" height="190" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>36. To protect large pieces, such as table-cloths, from falling to the floor,
    a deep <em>pocket</em> of muslin may be attached to each side of the ironing sheet
    so that it extends from end to end of the board and 
    within 6 or 8 inches of the floor, as in Fig. 13.</p>
  <p>Cut the pocket from unbleached muslin or a similar material, having it about
    40 inches square, finish the edges with a narrow hem, and sew a loop of tape
    or a metal ring at each corner. Attach small metallic or stiff wire arms
    underneath the board so that when these are swung out the 
    tapes may be placed over them, as at <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>. When not in use, the arms may
    be swung back underneath the board.</p>
  <p>37. <em>Iron stands</em> on which to rest the iron when not in use, are necessary
    on all boards, the permanent attachable metal stand being much more satisfactory
    than the wrought-iron stand or inverted tin covers, both of which have a
    way of slipping off the board.</p>
  <p>It is advisable to cut a piece of sheet <em>asbestos</em> to fit the broader end
    of the ironing board, and fasten the edges down with thumb-tacks. 
    This prevents scorching the ironing sheet when the iron stand becomes hot.
    Sometimes pieces of tin about 8 inches wide are tacked across the board in
    place of asbestos, but care must be taken to cover the edges so that garments
    cannot possibly become caught and torn.</p>
  <p><a name="irons" id="irons"></a>38. <strong>Irons</strong>.&#8212;There are various types of irons; the
    old-fashioned stove-heated flat, or sad, iron made entirely of iron, irons
    with removable wooden handles,
    also electric, gas, gasoline, charcoal, and alcohol irons. Although the old-fashioned,
    stove-heated iron can do its work efficiently, it cannot bring the comfort
    and ease to an ironer that a self-heating iron can. The woman who employs
    a self-heating iron does not have to consider saving steps, for instead of
    ironing near a hot stove or going back and forth to exchange a cold iron
    for a hot one, she can iron in one spot, and that a comfortable one. The
    type chosen, however, will depend on the facilities available for heating,
    but it is well to know the outstanding characteristics of each type.</p>
  <p class="clear"><a href="illust/hl-16-14.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',316,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/hl-16-14-t.jpg" alt="Figures 14 and 15" width="240" height="89" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>39. Among the <strong>stove-heated irons</strong>, flat irons with patent wooden handles
    and facing of steel, Fig. 14, are more modern than the old-fashioned irons
    of wrought iron, the most modern style having a removable handle and upper
    casing, as has the iron in Fig. 17. Such irons, which are likely to wabble,
    do not hold the heat so well, nor are they made in so many different shapes
    as the wrought-iron ones. They are, however, easier on the hands. Irons of
    both types are usually purchased in threes to allow for a sufficiently frequent
    change of iron.</p>
  <p>40. Among the <em>self-heating irons</em>, there is the <em>gas iron</em>, which
    is illustrated in Fig. 15. The rubber gas pipe of this iron is one of the
    greatest drawbacks
    in ironing by gas. This pipe will be safer and 
    give greater service if wound with spiral wire to prevent twisting and cracking.
    Then, too, it is necessary to beware of drafts that may fan the flame when
a gas iron is in use.</p>
  <p>In the use of <em>gasoline and alcohol irons</em>, the same precaution must be taken
    in regard to drafts. Also, there is danger from fire when leaks appear in
    the tank.</p>
  <p>In <em>charcoal irons</em>, the fuel gives out an even heat, but not an intense enough
    heat for continuous ironing. Also, the fumes are unpleasant and the fire
    is dangerous and soot-giving if fanned the wrong way.</p>
  <p class="clear"><a href="illust/hl-17-16.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',429,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/hl-17-16-t.jpg" alt="Figures 16 and 17" width="220" height="112" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>Although the <em>electric iron</em>, Fig. 16, is generally preferred, a few cautions
    in its use are necessary. The electric cord should be watched, for if any
    wires break there is danger of shock and fire. These breaks can be mended
    with adhesive tape when the current is disconnected. An electric iron should
    not be allowed to become overheated from too constant use. Instead, the power
    should be 
    turned off occasionally. Another caution is that a current of sufficiently
    high voltage should be used where an electric iron, or, in fact, any other
    electrical appliance, is attached, so that fuses will not be constantly burning
    out. Also, no other electrical appliance should be attached to the same connection
    by means of a double socket, while an electric iron is in operation for their
    combined demands are likely to burn out the fuse.</p>
  <p>41. In the choice of suitable irons, besides considering the types of irons,
    one must know that irons are made also for different kinds of work. For example,
    small irons are used for tiny, fine pieces; narrow, pointed irons, one of
    which is shown in Fig. 17, for garments on which there is shirring, fluting,
    or like trimming; and very large, 
    heavy irons, for tailoring. If only one iron is to be purchased, it should
    be of average size, one that weighs from 6 to 8 pounds. Too light an iron
    necessitates more pressure brought to bear on it.
    Since the point has the most work to do, another matter to consider in the
    purchase of an iron is that the point should heat quickly and retain its
    heat well.</p>
  <p>An electric iron may be tested for the time required for heating and for
    the evenness of its heating surface, by standing it on a well-protected heavy
    piece of paper and then turning on the current and letting it run without
    moving the iron. The time required for heating and the 
    evenness of the scorched spot will furnish the desired information.</p>
  <p class="clear">42. Among <a href="illust/hl-18-19.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',391,281);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/hl-18-19-t.jpg" alt="Figure 18" width="141" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>the <a href="illust/hl-18-18.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,526);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/hl-18-18-t.jpg" alt="Figure 18" width="169" height="193" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>appliances that lighten the labor of ironing and contribute
    toward convenience is the device illustrated in Fig. 18. It is a spring that
    is suspended on a cord and that has a hook to hold the cord of the electric
    iron so as to keep it from rubbing back and forth over the ironing board
    and rumpling and soiling the articles that are being ironed.</p>
  <p>In the illustration is shown also the electric fixture to which the iron
    is attached. When the <em>double socket</em>, Fig. 19, is screwed into the 
    fixture, the iron can be attached to one socket and an electric bulb to the
    other, thus utilizing one fixture for two purposes.</p>
  <p>43. Old-fashioned irons and sometimes irons with removable wooden handles
    require <em>iron holders</em>. These should be oval in shape so that there will be
    no corners to touch the iron and become burnt. Also, holders should be sufficiently
    thick to keep 
    the heat from penetrating. Ticking and asbestos are used in the ready-made
    holders, but folded stockings covered with ticking, denim, or other stout
    material make good holders. Wool does not make a serviceable covering, as
    it soon becomes charred.</p>
  <p>The alternate use of two holders will be found comfortable, as cool holders
    will keep the hands from becoming parched or swollen from continual heat.</p>
  <p><a name="mangle" id="mangle"></a>44. <strong>Mangle</strong>.&#8212;A mangle is an <strong>ironing machine</strong> that has rollers, either
    hand-turned or power-turned, working on the principle of the wringer. The
    cheapest, as to both cost and operation, are <em>cold mangles</em> that press the
    materials between unheated wooden rollers; but these machines do not press
    clothes dry and glossy and sterilize them; nor are they always able to take
    out all wrinkles. They are little better than wringers, except that they
    are larger, and after they have done their best, the articles must be hung
    up to dry.</p>
  <p><em>Heated mangles</em> have two rollers between which the articles are put. One
    end is usually open to admit garments. There are different sizes, the most
    satisfactory for the majority of homes being the size that irons large sheets
    after they have been folded once. Such mangles are a great time and labor
    saver in homes where there are large families and hence large washings, but
    they are rather expensive to purchase and install, so are not, for the small
    family, an economy in money. Mangles that are heated by electricity, gas,
    gasoline, or kerosene, may be had, thus fitting the needs of different localities.
    Very often electric equipment of this sort may be connected with a separate
    meter at lower rates than those for lighting.</p>
  <p>45. Just how much ironing is done by an ironing machine depends on the skill
    of the operator and the type of machine. Some mangles have attachments for
    the ironing of gathers and the shaping of garment parts, and other mangles
    have open ends upon which collars, cuffs, and other parts of garments can
    be ironed.</p>
  <p>The intelligent operator is able to do from 75 to 85 per cent. of her ironing
    on the mangle, thus making it possible to complete the ironing in from one-third
    to one-fourth the time it would take by hand. In this way, the necessity
    of a laundress may be eliminated, the ironing can be done with comfort, the
    work is made interesting, the life of the clothes is prolonged, and the home
    woman can use an abundance of fresh linen without having to think of the
    ironing.</p>
  <p>48. In the purchase of an ironing machine, take care to choose one that
    is easily operated. Some are operated by the feet, leaving both hands free
    to arrange the articles that are being run between the rollers. This is an
    excellent feature, for careful folding is one of the 
    secrets of successful ironing in a mangle. Another point to be sure of is
    that the electric switch of an electrically controlled mangle is placed conveniently.
    Then in case a garment becomes wrinkled or twisted around the roller, it
    can be released quickly without its being scorched or the worker being burned.
    Next, take care to secure a mangle that is large enough for the laundry that
    it will have to iron. Also, examine the mangle before purchasing to see that
    it can be readily cleaned, as much of its success depends on its being kept
    perfectly clean. Ease in its use is another important point, so be sure to
    purchase one that permits the operator to be seated while ironing.</p>
  <p>47. The care of a mangle is somewhat similar to that of the wringer, the
    iron, and the ironing board. When not in use and also when being heated,
    the rollers should be kept apart. The parts should be well oiled and cleaned
    regularly. The steel roller should be waxed and wiped so as to be kept as
    smooth and clean as the ironing surface of an iron, and the padded cylinder
    should be padded as evenly as an ironing board. Also both covers and padding
    should be washed occasionally, and the mangle, when it is not in use, should
    be covered to keep out the dust. By these means, better service can be obtained
    from ironing machines of all kinds.</p>
  <p class="clear"><a href="illust/hl-20-20.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',356,435);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/hl-20-20-t.jpg" alt="Figure 20" width="220" height="178" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>48. <strong>Clothes Horse</strong>.&#8212;To insure having clothes perfectly
    dry before they are put away, and so reduce to a minimum the likelihood of
    their wrinkling
    after ironing, it is well to have some sort of rack on which to hang them
    that will permit the free circulation of air through
    them. For this purpose, any small-size drier of the revolving type, or the
    type that is folded up against the wall, as shown in Fig. 20, or is pulled
    up against the ceiling is satisfactory. There is also a clothes-tree type
    with long arms that fold when not in use. The clothes horse that folds up
    like a screen, a portion of which is evident in Fig. 18, is, perhaps, the
    least satisfactory
    of all driers, since it has great propensities for tipping over.</p>
  <p class="clear"><a href="illust/hl-21-21.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',275,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/hl-21-21-t.jpg" alt="Figures 21 and 22" width="300" height="96" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>49<a name="49" id="49"></a>. <strong>Miscellaneous Articles</strong>.&#8212;Other helpful articles
    for laundering include a <em>pan</em> or <em>pail</em>, a <em>spoon</em>, a <em>measuring
    cup</em>, a <em>strainer</em>    for starch, a
    <em>clothes stick</em>, and a <em>sprinkler</em> or <em>whisk broom</em>, which serves the same 
    purpose. One kind of tin sprinkler is pictured in Fig. 21. Others vary somewhat
    in shape and may be aluminum rather than tin, but all have a general semblance.
    Also, a very effective sprinkler consists of a cork with a perforated top,
which may be purchased in the 10-cent store and used in any bottle.</p>
  <p>A <em>sleeve board</em> is not an essential, but it makes the ironing of
    sleeves a much shorter and simpler matter, and is also a boon in the 
    ironing of baby clothes. It should have one broad end and one narrow end,
and should be on a standard of its own.</p>
  <p><em>Curtain stretchers</em> act as time savers to the woman who does not send out
    her curtains. The ones shown in Fig. 22 are an improved type that make very
    simple the drying of curtains to measurements. The dark spaces are the slots
    through which the clamp screws slide when the stretchers are changed to fit
    the size of different curtains. Stretchers will take up less room if they
    have an easel, by means of which they may be stood up along a side wall.</p>
  <h5 class="clear"><a name="aids" id="aids"></a>LAUNDRY AIDS</h5>
  <p>50. In addition to the equipment used, there are countless materials on
    the market for the purpose of removing soil, grease, or stains, renewing
    fabric, restoring color, and bleaching. Such aids include soap, soap powder,
    soap flakes, borax, starch, bluing, and many others.</p>
  <p><a name="soaps" id="soaps"></a>51. <strong>Soap</strong>.&#8212;In choosing soap for laundering, the consistency
    is a determining factor. Laundry soaps may be yellow or white, according
    to the amount of
    rosin in them. Rosin is what adds weight to soaps, and a little is not objectionable
    as it helps also to make suds, but too much makes a sticky scum on clothes.
    Soaps may be strong according to the amount of soda or lye in them. If there
    is 
    an excess of soda or lye in a soap, the hands will soon disclose the fact,
because they will have a tendency to shrivel.</p>
  <p>In the choice of a safe and effective soap, the garments to be cleaned must
    be considered. For all fine, light fabrics of cotton, silk, or wool, a <em>mild
    white soap</em> or soap chips or jelly should be used. A heavy, strong soap containing
    much free alkali hardens wool, roughens silk fibers, and causes both to turn
    yellow; consequently, a soap of this kind should be avoided for such fabrics.</p>
  <p>For all badly soiled materials, where the fabric is durable in both texture
    and color, a <em>good yellow soap</em> should be used, as such soap removes the dirt
    more easily. Care should be taken in choosing such laundry soap, however,
    as some yellow soaps contain considerable rosin and are hard on the hands.</p>
  <p>For an all-purpose household soap, <em>naptha</em> is very popular. This soap is
    suitable for use in cold or lukewarm water, so it meets the need of the home
    where hot water is scarce. As it is harmful to some skins, its use is a point
    to be settled after experimenting.</p>
  <p>52<a name="52" id="52"></a>. <strong>Preparing and Using Soap</strong>.&#8212;When using <em>soap
      chips</em>, dissolve about
    3 tablespoonfuls of them in hot water from the faucet, whisking them about
    in the bowl or pan to obtain plenty of suds. Cool this solution by adding
    water until it feels warm to the hands and the tub is full enough to allow
    the garments to be completely immersed.</p>
  <p>If the <em>soap jelly</em> is preferred, shred white soap into a bowl or some similar
    receptacle and then add sufficient water to cover it, usually 1 cupful of
    water for each rounding tablespoonful of shredded soap, and then add 1/2
    teaspoonful of borax. Heat the mixture slightly until it is free from lumps,
    but do not allow it to boil. About 1/2 cupful of this may be used in a tub
    of water. Guard against the use of too much soap, as an excess will have
    a tendency to fade or &quot;harden&quot; a color.</p>
  <p>A <em>good soap for special cleaning</em> of dresses, suits, etc., can be made at
    home. Cut pure white soap into pieces about 1/2 inch thick and 2 inches long,
    cover with equal parts of ether and ammonia, let it set 24 hours, and then
    remove from the pan and dry in a cool place. This will remove grease, paints,
    and many other stains.</p>
  <p>53. In the use of any form of soap, use only enough to make a suds that
    will &quot;hold up&quot; during the washing process. More than 
    this makes a thick cushion-like mass that prevents the water from being forced
    through the fabric, and since it is this action that accomplishes the actual
    cleaning, it is evident that too much soap hinders, rather than helps, the
    process.</p>
  <p>54. <strong>Purchasing Soap</strong>.&#8212;Economy in purchasing soap does not mean the
    buying of cheap soaps, for these soaps may, and probably do, contain ingredients
    that harm the clothes seriously, causing weak spots or even holes, and affecting
    the color and &quot;feel.&quot;</p>
  <p>The only safe economy is the practice of buying soap in quantity, removing
    the wrappers, and storing it in a dry place to harden. A fairly hard soap,
    so treated, will last considerably longer than if this precaution is not
    taken.</p>
  <p><a name="bluing" id="bluing"></a>55. <strong>Bluing</strong>.&#8212;In order to counteract the tendency that white clothes
    have toward yellowing, a liquid or solid blue is added to the last rinse
    water. This bluing may be of vegetable, mineral, or chemical extraction of
    one of the following kinds.</p>
  <p>56. <strong>Indigo blue</strong>, the blue in earliest use, has been practically abandoned
    in its original form, as it was made from the indigo plant after a very tedious
    process. The indigo blue now in use is a chemical composition. In its favor
    is the fact that it contains no iron and so does not cause iron rust, but
    against it there are the objections that it gives a dull, almost black-blue
    instead of a good color, it often does not stand the heat of ironing well,
    and it is insoluble and therefore likely to settle on the clothes if not
    constantly kept in motion. Its insolubility adds also to its original expense,
    for it is not used up completely and is therefore less efficient than one
    that can be entirely dissolved.</p>
  <p>57. <strong>Ultramarine blue</strong>, a ball or block bluing, is another bluing now obtained
    in chemical composition instead of in its original form, which was the lapis
    lazuli finely ground. Because of the two points in its favor, namely, that
    it has a good, clear color and is free from iron, it is the bluing found
    in use in many homes. It is, however, an insoluble bluing that colors clothes
    by leaving a deposit of tiny particles on the fibers and is, therefore, likely
    to streak. Also, a portion of it is clay, so it is not a pure blue that can
    be entirely used up. Another point against it is that it decomposes in the
    presence of acids.</p>
  <p>As a test for ultramarine blue, set aside bluing in a glass to stand awhile.
    The particles will settle on the bottom, if the bluing is of this type.</p>
  <p>58. <strong>Prussian blue</strong> is the name for the liquid blue that was first made in
    Berlin. Practically all of the liquid bluings that are so popular for home
    laundries are made from Prussian blue. This form of bluing gives a bright,
    clear greenish-blue and becomes entirely dissolved in the rinse water. Although
    it is very inexpensive, it is sometimes a detriment to the clothes. The great
    danger in its use becomes apparent when clothes are not properly rinsed and
    the blue comes in contact with soap. Then, when the clothes are ironed, the
    salts of iron, in the presence of the alkali in the soap, become decomposed
    and are turned to iron-rust by the heat from the iron. Another disadvantage
    is that when the clothes are allowed to stand long in the sun, Prussian blue
    disintegrates.</p>
  <p>To test for this kind of bluing, heat a little with a strong solution of
    washing soda or after adding strong soap-suds to it; then if it turns from
    blue to a yellow or a yellowish-red, there is iron present.</p>
  <p>59. Although <strong>aniline blue</strong>, a byproduct of coal tar, is
    unknown to the majority of housewives, it is the form of bluing most used
    in commercial laundries.
    The color it gives can be either a blue-blue or a purple-blue. Since it is
    soluble, there is no waste, and since it contains no iron, there can be no
    danger of its causing iron-rust stains. The one caution that need be taken
    in its use is to use it weak enough. A little is a powerful dye and goes
    more than a long way, so if too much is used it cannot be easily bleached
    out.</p>
  <p><a name="starch" id="starch"></a>60<a name="60" id="60"></a>. <strong>Starch</strong>.&#8212;To give body to certain fabrics and garments, the process
    of starching is added to laundry work. For this purpose, there are four kinds
    of starch in use, each giving a different degree of stiffness and each having
    its own particular use.</p>
  <p><strong>Rice starch</strong>, or the liquid in which rice is boiled, is the mildest form.
    It is especially adapted for use on lingerie and baby clothes, but because
    it is expensive and difficult to obtain in quantities, it is seldom used
    except on rare laces or some other treasure that must be laundered and preserved
    with great care. The finish it gives is a beautiful gloss and softness that
    make a garment look like new.</p>
  <p><strong>Wheat starch</strong> makes a paste that penetrates clothing fibers
    and resists moisture a little more than does rice starch. Where different
    kinds of starch are used for different purposes, wheat starch is used on
    body clothes.</p>
  <p>Where a very stiff starch is desired, as for collars, cuffs, and shirt bosoms,
    <strong>corn starch</strong> is chosen. This is the cheapest, as well as the most viscous,
    starch on the market.</p>
  <p>Other stiffening agents are discussed in Arts. <a href="ldc-04.html#86">86</a> and <a href="ldc-04.html#87">87</a>, in connection
    with the laundering of white clothes.</p>
  <p>61<a name="61" id="61"></a>. Perhaps the most acceptable for general household purposes is a <strong>mixed</strong>,
    or <strong>blended, starch</strong>. This may be bought already prepared, as most housewives
    generally prefer, or it may be mixed at home. For a stiff starch, the proportion
    is two-thirds corn starch to one-third wheat starch, the corn starch furnishing
    the resisting power and the wheat starch, the pliability. For a more pliable
    starch, the ratio is two-thirds wheat starch to one-third corn starch.</p>
  <p>62. <strong>Acids and Alkalis</strong>.&#8212;In laundering or cleaning materials, acids
    and alkalis have important roles to play. Yet both must be used with great
    care and in weak solution or they will destroy the fibers of the material.
    Also, they must be rinsed thoroughly out of the fabric. Another point to
    remember about acids and alkalis is that they neutralize each other.</p>
  <p>63. Some acids remove color, while others set color. Consequently, some
    acids, such as oxalic acid and citric acid, which is not so strong as oxalic
    acid, are bleaches and stain removers, while other acids, such as acetic
    acid, which is found in vinegar, will make the color firmer than before.
    Another point to realize is that acids may be used only on materials made
    of vegetable fibers, and usually on white clothes only.</p>
  <p>A table telling just what acids affect the various stains and colors, and
    how to use them, is given in the Section on <em>Dry Cleaning</em>.</p>
  <p>64. Alkalis comprise such cleaning agents as lye, washing powders, soaps,
    soda, borax, and ammonia water. Their work is that of loosening the grease
    and soil from garments and softening the water.</p>
  <p>Nearly all alkalis may be used successfully on materials composed of vegetable
    fibers, but this is not the case with silks and wools, which come from animal
    fibers. For use on these, only the mild 
    alkalis, such as white soap, ammonia water (except on white silk) and borax,
    can be used with safety. Soda is injurious to silk, wool, and colors.</p>
  <p>Table I in Chapter II shows the ways of using alkalis as stain removers.
    Also, further instruction is given concerning the use of the alkalis that
    are essential in the usual washing processes.</p>
  <p><a name="softening" id="softening"></a>65. <strong>Softening Water</strong>.&#8212;Some water is hard because of containing large
    quantities of carbonates or sulphates, and cannot be used effectively as
    a cleaning agent. Therefore, it must be softened so that it will combine
    readily with the soap to make &quot;live&quot; suds that will cut the grease
    and release the dirt in garments. Unless the water is softened, the hard
    elements will combine with the soap and make a greasy scum that will settle
    on the clothes and on the sides of the tub, boiler, or other utensils.</p>
  <p>There are a number of methods of softening water, including the use of washing
    soda, borax, and ammonia. Following are the directions for their use:</p>
  <p>66<a name="66" id="66"></a>. <em>To soften water with washing soda</em>, dissolve 1 pound of soda in 1 quart
    of water, using 1 tablespoonful in 1 gallon of soapy water. Add sufficient
    water to soak the clothes.</p>
  <p>When washing soda is used, great care is required to have it thoroughly
    dissolved, as the soda will weaken threads and cause holes in the clothes
    if it comes in direct contact with them. Also, it is hard on silk, wool,
    and colors.</p>
  <p>67<a name="67" id="67"></a>. <em>To soften water with borax</em>, use 1 to 1 1/2 teaspoonfuls of borax to
    each gallon of water. Borax acts also as a mild bleach and has some virtue
    as a germ killer. It is less dangerous to silk, wool, and colored fabrics
    than washing soda.</p>
  <p>68<a name="68" id="68"></a>. <em>To soften water with ammonia</em>, consider first the kind of ammonia, for
    the strength determines the amount of water to be used. For ordinary use,
    the so-called &quot;household&quot; ammonia, procurable at grocery stores,
    is satisfactory. It is also handy, for it does not have to be diluted. The
    best grades of bottled household ammonia are cloudy.</p>
  <p>Some persons prefer the concentrated ammonia purchased at drug stores. This
    may be diluted five to ten times its original volume, and will prove an economy,
    but the bottle in which it is 
    kept must be tightly stoppered, as ammonia will lose its strength. When diluting
    ammonia, keep your face either below or turned away from the strangling fumes.</p>
  <p>Usually 3 tablespoonfuls of either diluted or &quot;household&quot; ammonia
    should be enough to soften 1 gallon of water.</p>

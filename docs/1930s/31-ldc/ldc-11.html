  <h5>  <a name="precaution" id="precaution"></a>PRECAUTIONS</h5>
  <p>55. Before any woman attempts to use gasoline or a similar cleaning agent,
    she must familiarize herself with several precautions in order both to make
    the cleaning process safe and to secure good results. These precautions,
    which are not difficult to understand nor observe, should be kept in mind
    all during the cleaning of a garment.</p>
  <p><a name="danger" id="danger"></a>56. <strong>Overcoming Danger</strong>.&#8212;The danger in using inflammable materials may
    be entirely eliminated by careful handling. Thousands of gallons of such
    materials are used daily with safety by those persons who understand the
    combustible nature of cleaning fluids and who exercise the necessary precautions.</p>
  <p><em>Avoid heat</em> when using inflammable cleaning materials by working out of doors
    in the shade, or by an open window in an unheated room.</p>
  <p><em>Avoid placing near a fire or light, or pressing with a hot iron</em>, garments
    cleaned with inflammable materials. The garment should be allowed to dry
    first.</p>
  <p><em>Avoid having on hand a supply of inflammable cleaning fluid</em> unless there
    is a basement or outside storehouse where it may <em>keep cool</em>.</p>
  <p><em>Do not inhale</em> the fumes of ether, chloroform, and carbon tetrachloride,
    as they have a sleep-producing effect.</p>
  <p><a name="odor" id="odor"></a>57. <strong>Overcoming Strong Odors</strong>.&#8212;Some cleaning agents have unpleasant
    or unhealthful odors, but if the following suggestions are noted these agents
    may be used in such a way that this objection is negligible.</p>
  <p><em>Choose a bright, clear day</em> so that quick evaporation will be possible.</p>
  <p><em>Work out of doors</em> and let the fresh air carry away the odor.</p>
  <p><em>Work rapidly</em>, having all materials assembled, as shown in Fig. 4.</p>
  <p><em>Neutralize unpleasant odors</em> by adding a few drops of oil of sassafras, mixing
    the oil with the last bath.</p>
  <p>For removing the after-odor from garments, it is necessary only to <em>allow
    sufficient time for the agent to evaporate.</em> After a garment has dried, evaporation
    may be quickened by means of heat supplied by pressing with a moderately
    hot iron, by hanging the garment in the sun (if this will not affect the
    color), or by placing it somewhat near a radiator or heater.</p>
  <p><a name="better" id="better"></a>58. <strong>Securing Better Results</strong>.&#8212;The poor results sometimes obtained after
    expending considerable time on dry cleaning have caused some amateur cleaners
    to become discouraged. The reason for these poor results is either that too
    little cleanser has been used or that the garment has not been rinsed well.</p>
  <p>To secure good results, therefore, <em>provide several gallons of cleanser</em> for
    cleaning. Dry cleaning requires only a third less cleaning fluid than the
    amount of water that a laundress would use if she were washing the garments.
    This is not an extravagant plan because a number of garments may be cleaned
    at one time, and the used cleanser may be strained, after the dirt has been
    allowed to settle, and preserved for the next cleaning day.</p>
  <p>Also, <em>remove the cleanser thoroughly</em> from the articles so that it is not
    allowed to run and cause streaks in the fabric. To avoid streaking, <em>use
    heavy towels to press out some of the moisture</em>.</p>
  <p><a name="protect" id="protect"></a>59. <strong>Protecting the Hands</strong>.&#8212;The fact that cleaners are hard on the hands
    has in some instances caused home cleaning to be avoided, but this may very
    easily be prevented.</p>
  <p><em>Apply glycerin or some good hand lotion</em> as soon as the hands are taken out
    of the cleanser. Soap should never be used until the skin has been thus softened.</p>
  <p><em>Use long rubber gloves</em> for protection when cleaning with gasoline or another
    cleaning oil.</p>
  <h5><a name="pgm" id="pgm"></a>DRY-CLEANING PROGRAM
  </h5>
  <p>60. Just as the work of wet washing is facilitated and good results are
    made more likely by a definite and systematic program, so the work of dry
    cleaning is made easier and more successful if a good program is adopted.
    For this purpose, the following processes are mentioned here in chronological
    order. Detailed explanations of them are given in other parts of the chapter.</p>
  <ol>
    <li> Sort clothes as to color.</li>
    <li> Examine nature of spots.</li>
    <li>  Mark with thread any that will be hard to see.</li>
    <li> Provide cleaning agents that will be needed.</li>
    <li> Set up the equipment out of doors in the shade or indoors in a
      well-ventilated room where there is no heat nor artificial light.</li>
    <li> Brush garments, turning pockets and folds inside out.</li>
    <li> Remove spots.</li>
    <li> Wash light-colored batch of clothes in vessel 1 and put in
      vessel 2.</li>
    <li> Wash medium-colored batch in vessel 1, shift first batch to
      vessel 3 and second batch to vessel 2.</li>
    <li> Wash dark-colored batch in vessel 1, hang up batch 1, shift
      second batch to vessel 3 and third batch to vessel 2.</li>
    <li> Remove any spots that show up after the first bath.</li>
    <li> Finish rinsing and drying second and third batches, using bath towels
    to absorb part of the moisture and then hanging garments in the air.</li>
    <li> After the absorbent has evaporated, either
                                press garments,
      using a cloth so as not to cause shine to appear,
      or steam garments if the fabric requires steaming.</li>
    <li> Air garments thoroughly.</li>
  </ol>
  <h5><a name="method" id="method"></a>METHOD OF PROCEDURE</h5>
  <p><em><a href="illust/dc-31-06.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',355,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/dc-31-06-t.jpg" alt="Figure 6" width="230" height="96" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>61. <strong>Sorting</strong>.&#8212;After choosing a favorable day for dry cleaning, proceed
    to sort the soiled articles. These should be spread out on a table in groups;
    first, the light ones, then those of medium color, and last the dark ones,
    as shown in Fig. 6.</p>
  <p>During the sorting, cleaning may be simplified by marking with a white thread
    all spots on dark fabrics. This plan makes it 
    possible for the person doing the cleaning to find all spots easily so that
    none will escape cleaning and show up after the garment has dried.</p>
  <p>Since gasoline and similar oils destroy the luster of buttons and buckles,
    if these have not been previously removed, they should be taken off garments
    at this time.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illust/dc-31-07.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,342);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/dc-31-07-t.jpg" alt="Figure 7" width="107" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>62. <strong>Brushing</strong>.&#8212;The next step is to remove as much
    dust as possible. Shake everything thoroughly or, with a smooth switch, 
    gently beat the fabric, preferably on a padded surface. Also, turn all pockets
inside out and brush, as shown in Fig. 7.</p>
  <p>63. <strong>Spotting</strong>.&#8212;Now you are ready for spotting, which is of greatest
    importance. Choose from Table I the correct stain remover for the spot to
    be removed and follow the method of procedure given in this table, as well
    as the more detailed directions in Arts. <a href="ldc-09.html#32">32</a> to 44 that apply to the particular
    reagent required. Follow several methods, if necessary, until all traces
    of stains have disappeared.</p>
  <p>64. <strong>Order of Washing</strong>.&#8212;Use 3 or 4 
    vessels with lids, as explained; 3 are sufficient if the garments are not
      very soiled. 
    Fill each one one-half to three-quarters full of the particular cleaning
    fluid you have chosen, and put the first vessel into a larger 
    one of very hot water to heat. If dry-cleaning soap is used, put it in the
first vessel.</p>
  <p>Wash in vessel No. 1 the articles in the first pile, those lightest in
    color. Place them in vessel No. 2. allowing them to drip while in your hands,
    and cover vessel No. 2. Then thoroughly wash in vessel No. 1 the next lot,
    those of medium color. In the meanwhile, put the articles from vessel No.
    2 into No. 3, Now lift the articles from No. 1, allow them to drip a little
    while in your hands, and place them in vessel No. 2. Then commence washing
    the third lot in vessel No. 1.</p>
  <p>This changing of articles from one vessel to another is done for the purpose
    of always bringing the first lot, the light pieces, into contact with the
    fresh cleanser.</p>
  <p>65. <strong>Cautions in Washing</strong>.&#8212;During washing, <em>do not
      rub the garments, but rather work them up and down</em> in the liquid and squeeze it through
      the fabric gently. This procedure will keep the material free from wrinkles
      and be an aid in pressing. Also, it is easier on the fibers.</p>
  <p><em>Do not let any part of the article dry until the whole has been cleaned</em>,
    for in this lies the secret of successful dry cleaning at home. To prevent
    material from drying and at the same time to work on the spots as the garments
    are taken from one bath to the other, use a large, flat pan, or the sink
    arrangement described in Art. <a href="ldc-10.html#48">48</a>. Place flat on the bottom of the pan, or
    sink, the part of the garment in which the spot shows, and work on it there.</p>
  <p>The object in placing the garment in either of these receptacles while working
    on it to remove spots, is to keep the garment wet instead of having to squeeze
    out the fluid when the garment is removed from one bath preparatory to being
    placed in another. If put into the pan or shallow sink while still dripping
    wet, parts of the garment will not become dry and will cause marks to form.</p>
  <p>Before cleaning elaborately draped garments or those intricately trimmed,
    it is better for the amateur to rip the dress, blouse, or skirt partially
    in order to facilitate the work. After pressing, slip the dress on, pin the
    details back in position, and replace the stitches.</p>
  <p>66. <strong>Rinsing</strong>.&#8212;<em>Rinse thoroughly</em> in the last vessel
    the articles first treated and then spread them upon the table and examine.
    If dirty pieces
    are still found, rub the articles with a clean tampon dipped in cleanser
    or alcohol. If desired, as the garments come out 
    of the last rinse, place them in a vessel in which the adhering cleaner will
drain off while you are washing other articles.</p>
  <p>67. <strong>Drying</strong>.&#8212;<em>Never wring garments</em> to free them from dry-cleaning liquids,
    or you will cause streaking and wrinkling. <em>Press out some of the moisture
    gently with the hands</em>, and, when garments are not too bulky, <em>place
    them between two heavy bath towels</em> to absorb the surplus. Dresses, blouses, jackets, and
    the like should be placed on hangers where they can be allowed to drip. For
    the drying and evaporating process, 36 hours is the time recommended by professionals.</p>
  <p>Frequently a garment is not cleaned until time to wear it. As a general
    rule, this should be avoided because there is great danger in wearing a garment
    too soon after cleaning. But if it is necessary to wear it 10 or 12 hours
    after cleaning, hang the garment in a warm place after it is dry and the
    heat will remove the odor and help to absorb the cleaner more quickly.</p>

  <h5>  <a name="fur" id="fur"></a>FURS</h5>
  <p>85. Although silk and wool materials may be thoroughly washed by putting
    them through several cleaning baths and rubbing the spots as the work is
    proceeded with, it will be found that some very delicate fabrics might be
    injured by such handling. Again, it would not be practical to immerse some
    articles, such as furs, heavy coats, or mattresses, in a cleaning fluid,
    Such things may be surface cleaned very satisfactorily.</p>
  <p>86. <strong>Cleaning White Plush and Fur</strong>.&#8212;A thin paste of
    gasoline and common wheat flour can be used for washing white beaver, white
    plush, and white
    fur. To make the paste, pour a pint of 
    gasoline into a clean china bowl and put into it 2 tablespoonfuls of white
    flour. Stir the mixture until a thin, even paste is formed and then wash
    in it the materials that are to be cleaned. An oblong, shallow pan, such
as a roasting or baking pan, makes the best container.</p>
  <p>When the washing is finished, dry the materials thoroughly, first squeezing
    out as much as possible of the gasoline. Then brush the white fur or white
    plush with a stiff-bristle brush. However, if the fur is of the long-hair
    variety, it should be combed.</p>
  <p>87. <strong>Cleaning Colored Furs With Bran</strong>.&#8212;Fur of any color may be cleaned
    with dry bran. Purchase a pound of clean bran at any feed store. Put it in
    a dry pan and set it inside the oven until it becomes heated to such a temperature
    that the hand cannot be held in it with comfort, as this insures its being
    thoroughly dry. Stretch the fur on an ironing board and hold it in place
    by pins set fairly close together, so that it is firmly fastened to the board.
    Brush the fur with a stiff-bristle brush, rub in thoroughly the heated bran,
    and brush again to remove the surplus bran. Then unpin the fur and shake
    it well to remove all evidences of the bran.</p>
  <p>This method not only cleans the fur but makes it glossy. It can be applied
    to plush also, but plush requires an additional steaming process before the
    nap is sufficiently freshened.</p>
  <p>88. <strong>Cleaning Furs With Corn-Meal</strong>.&#8212;Furs may be cleaned with corn-meal
    in the same way as with bran. Use white corn-meal for white or light furs;
    for darker furs, yellow is satisfactory. Heat the meal so that it is thoroughly
    dried and cover the fur with it. Let it stand 10 or 15 minutes and then take
    it out by brushing and shaking the fur thoroughly. Then put the fur out in
    the air.</p>
  <p>89. <strong>Cleaning Furs With Fullers' Earth</strong>.&#8212;Fullers' earth is often used
    for cleaning furs, especially when they are very soiled. Use the fullers'
    earth as any of the other absorbents.</p>
  <p>90. <strong>Cleaning Furs With Cleaning Oils</strong>.&#8212;If absorbents are not effective,
    furs may first be put through the cleaning baths and then, after drying,
    treated with corn-meal. It must be remembered that furs put in cleansers
    must be subjected to heat after evaporation for a greater length of time
    than fabrics in order to deodorize them thoroughly.</p>
  <p>91. <strong>Cleaning Furs With Commercial Preparations</strong>.&#8212;Besides the simple,
    home methods that have been described, there are commercial preparations
    that may be bought from any drug store and used successfully according to
    the directions that accompany them.</p>
  <h5><a name="glove" id="glove"></a>GLOVES</h5>
  <p>92. <strong>Cleaning Kid Gloves</strong>.&#8212;Kid gloves that are not
    seriously discolored or stained with perspiration may be easily cleaned by
    immersing in several
    cleaning baths, as for garment cleaning, but, if necessary, they may be handled
    more vigorously than fabrics.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illust/dc-40-11.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',493,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/dc-40-11-t.jpg" alt="Figures 11 and 12" width="338" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Fig. 11 shows the warm cleansing fluid bath in which the gloves are first
    immersed. Allow them to remain in this bath a few hours to loosen the dirt;
    then rub between the hands and scrub with a stiff brush, as in Figs. 12 and
    13, or rub on a small washboard. Next, rinse thoroughly and wipe with a soft
    cloth. If necessary, dry further with Turkish towels, as in <em><a href="illust/dc-41-13.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',399,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/dc-41-13-t.jpg" alt="Figures 13 and 14" width="300" height="142" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Fig. 14, and
    put on glove stretchers. Gloves should not be dried too rapidly, as this
    tends to make them stiff, but they may be dried as much as possible with
    towels and then laid in a warm place to finish drying. When thoroughly dry,
    shape them carefully and smooth them with the hands, as illustrated in Fig.
    15.</p>
  <p><em><a href="illust/dc-41-15.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',290,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/dc-41-15-t.jpg" alt="Figure 15" width="240" height="81" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>Water stains on kid gloves</em> are difficult to remove successfully, but by
    treatment in the cleanser, they may be somewhat lessened.</p>
  <p><em>Perspiration stains</em> cannot be removed with any assurance of good results.</p>
  <p class="clear">93. <strong>Cleaning Chamois and Doeskin Gloves</strong>.&#8212;Chamois and doeskin gloves
    may be washed on the hands with pure, mild soap or 
    soap flakes and lukewarm water, but they require great care in laundering
    to have them soft and pliable when dry. The more soap constantly used in
    the water, the softer and more silky will the gloves appear.</p>
  <p>Free the dirt in a soapy bath and then put the gloves through several lukewarm
    rinse waters. In the last one, dissolve enough soap flakes or pure soap to
    make the water look milky. Without twisting, squeeze as dry as possible in
    a towel. Pull the gloves into 
    shape carefully and smooth out the fingers by blowing into them. Finish the
    drying by spreading the gloves flat on a dry towel.</p>
  <p>Never hang such gloves in the sun or near the heat, for they are likely
    to dry too quickly and become hard.</p>
  <p>94. <strong>Cleaning Buckskin Gloves</strong>.&#8212;Buckskin gloves may be washed with pure
    white soap and water or in a cleaner. The latter is perhaps more satisfactory
    unless the gloves are of very good quality. A brush with very stiff bristles
    should be used to cleanse them thoroughly.</p>
  <p>95. <strong>Cleaning Washable Kid</strong>.&#8212;Put gloves of this kind on the hands and
    wash them in suds made with pure white soap or soap flakes and lukewarm water.
    Rinse thoroughly and dry them slowly. When dry, rub a little talcum powder
    into the gloves to restore the soft finish.</p>
  <h5><a name="hat" id="hat"></a>HATS</h5>
  <p>96. Hats represent a special branch of cleaning, and come properly under
    the head of millinery renovating. For home use, however, the following simple
    suggestions will be found of value.</p>
  <p>97. <strong>Cleaning White or Light Felt Hats</strong>.&#8212;First brush white or light
    felt hats thoroughly, then go over the surface lightly with fine sandpaper.
    If very soiled, use a cleaner and a light woolen cloth and rub the felt well.
    Then, brush and shape with the hands.</p>
  <p>Still another method is to make a paste of powdered magnesia and water and
    spread it over the hat. This may be brushed off when thoroughly dry.</p>
  <p>White, also colored, beaver hats may be cleaned with wood alcohol applied
    with a soft brush.</p>
  <p>98. <strong>Cleaning Straw Hats With Oxalic Acid</strong>.&#8212;Hats made of milan, hemp,
    panama, and rough straw braids in natural colors may be cleaned by using
    a weak solution of oxalic acid.</p>
  <p><em>To prepare an oxalic solution</em> sufficiently strong for a badly sunburnt hat,
    dissolve 1 tablespoonful of oxalic acid in 1 pint of water, a process that
    will require from 15 to 20 minutes. When the acid is dissolved completely,
    pour 1 teaspoonful of the solution on a clean pine board. If it foams, or
    forms bubbles, it is too strong and should be weakened. Add more water and
    test the solution again. As soon as it fails to foam, it is of the correct
    strength.</p>
  <p>99. While cleaning a hat by this method, do not put the hands in the acid
    solution. Use a small white-bristle scrubbing brush and scrub the hat quickly,
    beginning at the center of the crown and rubbing around and around until
    the side crown is reached; then continue around the side crown and on to
    the brim, rubbing the brush in a circle and in the same direction all the
    time.</p>
  <p>Rinse the straw quickly with clean water, using the same brush for this
    purpose. Place the hat in the air or in the sunlight so that it will dry.
    The work must be done quickly in order that the straw may not become too
    damp and puff up. When the hat is perfectly dry, press it into shape under
    a damp cloth, using a hot iron. The ironing board used for this purpose should
    be heavily padded and the pressing should be done very lightly; otherwise,
    the imprint of the iron will flatten the straw. The damp cloth used should
    be lintless, if possible.</p>
  <p>100. <strong>Cleaning Men's Straw Hats With Salts of Lemon</strong>.&#8212;Straw hats may
    be cleaned in a solution of 1 tablespoonful of salts of lemon to 1/2 pint
    of water. Dissolve by boiling, and after the solution cools apply to the
    hat with a firm brush, starting at the top. Dry with a soft cloth. Do not
    allow this cleaner to touch the sweat band, as it will harden the leather.</p>
  <p>101. <strong>Bleaching Straw Hats</strong>.&#8212;To bleach a straw hat, make a paste by
    adding to the juice of 1 lemon enough powdered sulphur to make it smooth.
    Cover the hat well and put it in the sun until dry. Then brush with a fine
    brush dipped in water and wipe with a dry cloth.</p>
  <p>102. <strong>Dressing a Straw Hat</strong>.&#8212;To give a glossy finish or to stiffen a
    straw hat, apply a solution of 1 part transparent shellac to 5 parts wood
    alcohol.</p>
  <h5><a name="feather" id="feather"></a>FEATHERS</h5>
  <p><em><a href="illust/dc-44-16.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,635);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/dc-44-16-t.jpg" alt="Figure 16" width="205" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>103<a name="103" id="103"></a>. <strong>Cleaning White or Light-Colored Feathers</strong>.&#8212;When cleaning feathers,
    aigrettes, and paradise plumes that are white or light in color, a large
    china or earthenware bowl, as shown in Fig. 16, should be used. Dry the bowl
    thoroughly, and pour into it a pint of clean cleanser. Wash the feather by
    sousing it up and down thoroughly.</p>
  <p>It is generally unnecessary to rub the flues of the feathers, but if you
    do rub them, start at the point where the flues are joined to the stem of
    the feather and move the tips of the fingers outwards along the flues, pressing
    lightly. When the tips of the flues are reached, lift the hand and start
    again at the stem. Do not rub 
    the flues back and forth, but move the fingers always in the same direction;
    that is, outwards from the stem to the tips of the flues.</p>
  <p>Continue the operation until all of the flues on both sides of the stem
    are washed clean. Then pick up the feather and draw it through the lightly
    closed fist, in the manner shown in Fig. 16, in order to squeeze out most
    of the cleanser from the flues. Repeat this operation several times, until
    the greater part of the cleanser has been squeezed out.</p>
  <p>104. When the feather has been washed thoroughly in the manner just described,
    throw away the dirty cleanser used for washing it, and wipe the bowl clean
    and dry. Pour in a pint of fresh cleanser, and to it add 2 tablespoonfuls
    of wheat flour. Stir the flour into the cleanser until a smooth, thin paste
    is formed. Then stir the feather around or lay it in the paste and rub the
    flues lightly from the stem toward the ends with the tips of the fingers,
    in exactly the same manner as described for cleaning the feather the first
    time. When the feather has been washed completely in this way, draw it through
    the closed hand to squeeze out the cleanser, and shake it in the air until
    the remaining cleanser has evaporated and the feather is almost dry, a process
    that will require from 2 to 5 minutes.</p>
  <p>105. When the feather is practically dry, it must be rolled in clean corn
    starch. To do this, spread a piece of tissue paper flat on the table and
    sprinkle it lightly but evenly with corn starch. Roll the feather back and
    forth in the corn starch by twisting the stem until it is well covered. Then
    shake the feather to remove the loose particles of starch adhering to the
    flues, and the cleaning process is finished.</p>
  <p>The advantage of this method of cleaning is that it will not take the curl
    out of the feather, as in the case of soap and water, but it must be remembered
    that this process is for cleaning white and light-colored feathers only.</p>
  <p>106. <strong>Cleaning Black or Dark-Colored Feathers</strong>.&#8212;Because of the dyes
    used to color them, feathers or plumes that are dyed with black, or with
    other dark dyes, must be washed in wood alcohol instead of a cleaner. The
    method of washing, however, is exactly the same as that described in Art.
    <a href="#103">103</a>, except that the feathers are not put through a flour paste, nor are
    they rolled in corn starch after they are dry, as the white starch would
    show plainly on the dark flues.</p>
  <p>107. <strong>Cleaning Feathers With Soap and Water</strong>.&#8212;It is possible to clean
    feathers with soap and water, if desired, but in doing so all the curl will
    be taken out of the flues, so that the feathers will have to be curled again
    when dry. Yet this is perhaps the favorite method of cleaning white feathers.</p>
  <p>To clean a white feather in this way, make a good suds of warm water and
    pure soap or soap flakes. Wash the feather in this according to the method
    described for washing in a cleaner, omitting the flour paste. Then rinse
    in two or three changes of clean water, the last one being slightly blued.
    When the drying is practically complete, roll the feather in clean corn starch
    to give weight to the flues. Shake off part of the starch, and the flues
    are ready to be steamed and curled.</p>
  <p>Paradise aigrettes also may be cleaned successfully by this method.</p>
  <p>108. <strong>Cleaning Feather Banding</strong>.&#8212;Feather banding cannot
    be successfully cleaned unless the feathers are attached by a woven process
    or by stitching.
    Pasted banding cannot be renovated. To 
    clean feather banding, either the method for cleaning white or light-colored
    feathers or that for cleaning black or dark-colored feathers may be employed,
according to the color of the banding.</p>
  <h5><a name="velvet" id="velvet"></a>VELVET</h5>
  <p>109. <strong>Preliminary Precautions</strong>.&#8212;Velvet may be put through the cleaning
    baths if very soiled, but since it takes such fabric a long time to dry,
    surface cleaning is usually better for it.</p>
  <p>A mistake many women make in the effort to restore the appearance of velvet
    is their failure to realize that it must be cleaned before it is steamed.
    Failure to clean velvet accounts for the dull and rather smeary appearance
    of the collars of overcoats and suits cleaned at home.</p>
  <p>The first thing, then, to do in cleaning velvet is to remove all dust by
    beating it gently on a padded surface or by brushing. A brush with firm bristles
    that are not too stiff should be used, a cheap hair brush being satisfactory
    if kept for no other purpose. Also, to remove surface lint only, a roll of
    old velvet made into a little pad about 5 by 2 inches makes a splendid brush.
    After brushing, beat gently once more and the velvet is then ready for the
    actual cleaning.</p>
  <p>110. <strong>Cleaning Silk Velvet</strong>.&#8212;In order that silk velvet may be cleaned
    easily and quickly, it must be flat and smooth; therefore, lay the piece
    on the top of an ironing board, stretch it so as to remove all wrinkles,
    and pin it on all four edges to the cloth covering of the ironing board.</p>
  <p>The actual cleaning is done generally with chloroform applied by means of
    a small sponge. Pour a few drops of chloroform on the sponge and rub it carefully
    over the pile of the velvet. The chloroform will evaporate very rapidly,
    so, as soon as the sponge becomes dry, pour on a few more drops and proceed
    as before. In addition to removing stains and spots, this method of cleaning
    will restore the color of the velvet to a certain extent. In using chloroform,
    remember to do the work out of doors, on a porch, or near an open window,
    never in a closed room.</p>
  <p>Wood alcohol or one of the other spotting agents may be used instead of
    chloroform with good results, alcohol being the best, for dark colors.</p>
  <p>Whatever solvent you use, do not consider the velvet cleaned until you have
    steamed it. This process, together with the gentle brushing you give the
    velvet during the steaming, will raise the nap.</p>
  <p>111. <strong>Cleaning Cotton Velvet</strong>.&#8212;Dark, cotton velvet and corduroy may
    be cleaned by the use of solvents, but white or light-colored, cotton velvet
    and corduroy generally must be wet cleaned. Before they are subjected to
    the soap bath, they must be well brushed. They may be washed by hand or in
    a washing machine, and allowed to dry without being wrung. If the material
    is white cotton velvet or corduroy and it needs bleaching, use Javelle water,
    but do not use it if there is any silk in the material, as it will harm the
    silk fiber.</p>
  <h5><a name="silk" id="silk"></a>SILKS</h5>
  <p>112. <strong>Cleaning Silk With Absorbents</strong>.&#8212;If the soil on silk is fresh and
    partakes of the nature of grease or coloring matter or some stain made by
    cocoa, for instance, which contains both grease and color, it may be removed
    by French chalk, fullers' earth, powdered magnesia, starch, pipe clay, bran,
    or salt. The absorbent should be warmed before being applied, as the heat
    loosens the grease more quickly.</p>
  <p>Lay the silk on clean paper and cover it with the absorbent, or put it between
    two layers of the absorbent. If the powder takes up much dirt immediately,
    scrape it off and apply a fresh supply. Otherwise, lay the silk away for
    a day or two; then shake and brush out the powder. It is surprising what
    dark, ugly marks can be removed in this simple way.</p>
  <p>113. <strong>Cleaning Satin</strong>.&#8212;Satin of good quality may be cleaned very satisfactorily.
    Make a weak solution of borax by dissolving 1 tablespoonful of powdered borax
    in 1 quart of water. Stretch the satin on top of the ironing board or the
    work table and sponge it lightly, dipping the sponge into the borax solution
    and rubbing always with the grain of the satin and not across it. When the
    satin has dried, iron it on the wrong side only.</p>
  <p>This process is excellent for cleaning, but will not restore the color.
    If there are grease spots on the satin, they should be removed by a stain
    remover or an absorbent previous to sponging.</p>
  <h5><a name="ribbon" id="ribbon"></a>RIBBONS</h5>
  <p>114. <strong>Renovating Velvet Ribbons</strong>.&#8212;To renovate velvet ribbons, first
    brush out all dust and then sponge the wrong side with 1 part of ammonia
    to 3 parts of water, or with the solvents mentioned for cleaning piece velvet.
    The ribbon is then ready to be steamed according to one of the methods described
    in Arts. <a href="ldc-13.html#80">80</a> and 81 for steaming velvet.</p>
  <p>115. <strong>Cleaning Colored Silk Ribbons</strong>.&#8212;Gasoline or one of its derivatives
    produces good results in cleaning silk ribbons. Either sponge or dip the
    ribbon; then lay it between layers of Turkish toweling and take out as much
    moisture as possible. Press on the wrong side first, with a soft muslin cloth
    over it, and then without the cloth. Never press ribbon on the right side.</p>
  <p>116. <strong>Washing Ribbons</strong>.&#8212;Although soap-and-water washing is not precisely
    a dry-cleaning process, it is a safe method of cleaning ribbons of good quality.
    These can be washed in warm suds of soft water and soap jelly or soap flakes.
    Rinse in clean, soft water and hang up to dry without squeezing or wringing
    so as to avoid creases. Iron while damp, first with a cloth over them, and
    then without.</p>
  <p>117. <strong>Sponging Ribbons</strong>.&#8212;Another method of wet washing ribbon is to
    spread the ribbon flat on a smooth hard surface, like a table top or a marble
    slab, and sponge or brush with lukewarm water in which a little mild soap
    has been dissolved. Rinse by holding the ribbon stretched between the hands
    and passing it through a bowl of clear water of the same temperature. Dry
    by spreading it out straight and flat on a smooth, hard surface. Draw the
    hand gently over it to press out air bubbles, which may have formed under
    the ribbon and would make it look &quot;blistered&quot; when dry. No pressing
    will be necessary.</p>
  <h5><a name="lace" id="lace"></a>LACES</h5>
  <p>118. <strong>Cleaning With Solvents</strong>.&#8212;As laces are very delicate,
    they should not be handled more than is necessary in cleaning them. Very
    fine laces should
    be basted to muslin, as described in Art. <a href="ldc-04.html#141">141</a>, <em>Home Laundering</em>, and washed
    thoroughly in a cleaner. The 
    same precautions should be taken in order to keep them from having any delicate
    fibers broken. Shaking in a fruit jar, as explained in Art. <a href="ldc-04.html#140">140</a>, <em>Home
    Laundering</em>,
is a very satisfactory method.</p>
  <p>Alcohol, carbon tetrachloride, or a similar solvent may be used instead
    of a gasoline derivative.</p>
  <p>119. <strong>Cleaning With Absorbents</strong>.&#8212;A very simple way to clean laces that
    have become greasy or spotted by something containing oils or fats is to
    lay them in French chalk, powdered magnesia, or one of the other absorbents.
    Quicker action and better results are obtained if the powder is heated. Allow
    the lace to remain in the powder for a day or two before shaking it.</p>
  <p>120. <strong>Cleaning Gold and Silver Laces</strong>.&#8212;It is possible to brighten metal
    laces by putting them through a cleaning bath, but it is not possible to
    restore them entirely. Wash the laces carefully in the cleanser and then
    lay them flat and rub them with soft cheesecloth that has been dipped in
    alcohol.</p>
  <p>121. <strong>Cleaning Chiffon, Veiling, and Silk Net</strong>.&#8212;Such sheer fabrics as
    chiffon, veiling, and silk net are best cleaned by being left in a covered
    fruit jar partly filled with cleanser for an hour or so. Remove the article
    without disturbing the dirt that will settle at the bottom of the jar. Dip
    in clean cleanser and roll in a towel to dry.</p>
  <h5><a name="misc" id="misc"></a>MISCELLANEOUS ARTICLES</h5>
  <p><a name="mattress" id="mattress"></a>122. <strong>Mattresses, Bolsters, and Pillows</strong>. &#8212; When mattresses become spotted
    or soiled they may be cleaned by washing the surfaces with warm water and
    Ivory soap, using a soft brush. Allow one side of the mattress to dry before
    washing the other side.</p>
  <p>In the case of bolsters and pillows, also, lukewarm water with a good suds
    of Ivory soap makes the most effective cleaning method. Add 2 tablespoonfuls
    of ammonia to a tub of water; then dip and squeeze and turn the pillows or
    bolster until clean. Rinse well in clear water and hang in the sun to dry.
    A windy day is best for drying. Always clean pillows before the ticking becomes
    too badly stained.</p>
  <p>For spots on such articles that are otherwise clean, make a paste of starch
    and household ammonia. Coat the spot thickly with this and allow it to stand
    12 to 24 hours before brushing. Also, if 
    possible, place the stains in the sun. Repeat such applications, if necessary.</p>
  <p>123. <strong>Neckties</strong>.&#8212;Men's neckties should be put through cleaning baths
    and very carefully spotted, especially the part that is tied. Spotting, in
    this work, means not merely removing spots or soil, but also streaks of wear.
    Rub these carefully in order to remove them.</p>
  <p>In cleaning a tie, it is essential to remove the wrinkles as well as to
    remove the soil. To do this, it is often necessary to open the seam over
    the part that is tied and then press the silk of the tie from the wrong side
    as well as the interlining.</p>
  <p><a name="coat" id="coat"></a>124. <strong>Soiled Coat Collars</strong>.&#8212;The soiled collars of coats may be cleaned
    with a thick lather made by using much soap and a small amount of water.
    Of, if preferred, the following mixture may be used:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>1 1/2 ounces white Castile soap </li>
    <li>1 ounce denatured alcohol </li>
    <li>1 ounce ether          </li>
    <li>4 ounces ammonia</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Cut the soap fine, add 1 pint of soft water, and heat until the soap is
    dissolved. Add 3 quarts of cold water and then the other ingredients, and
    bottle tightly for future use. Shake before using.</p>
  <p>Apply the mixture to the surface to be cleaned with a soft brush; then wipe
    thoroughly with a non-linting cloth, and rinse.</p>
  <p>125. <strong>Silk Parasols</strong>.&#8212;Open the parasol and clean the surface with a
    piece of cheesecloth dipped in a cleaner. After rinsing with clean cleanser,
    go over the surface with alcohol. Wipe with a dry, soft cloth and dry further
    by whirling in the air. Cotton or linen parasols may be washed by using the
    soap sponge as suggested in Art. <a href="ldc-09.html#39">39</a>.</p>
  <p><a name="rain" id="rain"></a>136. <strong>Rain Coats</strong>.&#8212;It is difficult to restore the new appearance to
    rain coats, but soap and water will serve in some cases. Soiled spots may
    be removed by scrubbing the surface with these cleaning agents. The rain
    coat should then be rinsed thoroughly and hung on a coat hanger dripping
    wet.</p>
  <p>Avoid using gasoline or one of its derivatives, as it destroys the rubber
    used in waterproofing.</p>
  <p>127. <strong>Patent Leather</strong>.&#8212;If patent leather becomes finger-marked, dip
    a cloth in cold milk and rub until the marks have disappeared. When dry,
    polish with a clean, dry, soft cloth. Vaseline is good for both softening
    and polishing patent leather.</p>
  <p><a name="shoes" id="shoes"></a>128. <strong>Shoes and Slippers</strong>.&#8212;The appearance of suede, satin, or metal-cloth
    shoes and slippers may be improved greatly by rubbing with a tampon dipped
    in cleanser. It is not generally satisfactory to try to wash the shoe thoroughly
    because the dressing on the edges of the soles is likely to run into the
    upper portion.</p>
  <p>Suede shoes may be greatly improved by brushing with a wire brush, or by
    rubbing the surface lightly with No. 00 steel wool. There are commercial
    cleaners, too, that come in a variety of colors. Perhaps the most satisfactory
    is in the form of a stick, one end of which is the cleaning agent and the
    other, a brush.</p>
  <p>White or light-colored kid shoes may be cleaned by any of the commercial
    preparations for such purposes.</p>
  <p>129. <strong>Buckles</strong>.&#8212;To clean cut-steel buckles that have
    become rusty, rub them with a stiff-bristle brush that has been dipped into
    a thin paste made
    by mixing 1 teaspoonful of sweet oil and 1/2 teaspoonful of emery dust.
    After the buckles have been cleaned in this way, wipe them dry and then brush
    them with a soft-bristle brush, so as to remove the rust and the particles
    of emery dust and thus make them bright. In brushing, take care that none
    of the emery dust gets into the eyes.</p>
  <p>130. <strong>Buttons</strong>.&#8212;To clean and brighten buttons, whether of bone, metal,
    or glass, polish them with French chalk, using a chamois or a soft cloth
    for doing the work. In cleaning carved buttons, use a soft brush to remove
    every particle of chalk.</p>
  <p><a name="carpets" id="carpets"></a>131. <strong>Carpets and Rugs</strong>.&#8212;It is possible to clean carpets with a solution
    made by dissolving 1/4 cake of white soap in 2 quarts of boiling water. When
    lukewarm, add 2 tablespoonfuls of household ammonia and 2 quarts of lukewarm
    water. Wipe the carpet with this, and follow with an application of clean
    water. Although strictly speaking, not a dry-cleaning reagent, this solution,
    because of its efficacy, is very widely sanctioned.</p>
  <p>If one wishes simply to freshen a carpet or rug, it may be wiped, after
    sweeping, with vinegar and water in the proportion of 1 cupful of vinegar
    to 1 gallon of lukewarm water.</p>

  <h2>Laundering
  as a Business</h2>
  <p>185. If one has a small capital to install machinery (it need not be elaborate)
    and a means of conveying the clothes, a laundry business may be started;
    and if the field is a good one and the work receives close attention, it
    is bound to grow. As the business begins to pay for itself, equipment may
    be added from time to time. If one were contemplating such a project, the
    best plan would be to visit a number of commercial laundries, perferably
    the smaller ones, and, if possible, to work in one to gain experience.</p>
  <p>186. <strong>Hand Laundries</strong>.&#8212;If one wishes to start business without an outlay
    of much money, one may specialize in fine laundering. Often the garments
    in the so-called &quot;hand&quot; laundries are washed very satisfactorily
    in machines and particular attention is given to them in the starching and
    bluing processes. All garments of course, are ironed by hand.</p>
  <p>187. <strong>Commercial Laundering</strong>.&#8212;Laundering by the machine process may
    be started in a small way as mentioned. Usually all of the washing and most
    of the ironing is done by machines. All of the ironing in some large laundries
    is done by machines that are made especially to iron certain garments.</p>
  <p>Service rendered by a commercial laundry comes under three heads; finished
    work, rough-dry laundering, and wet-wash service.</p>
  <p><em>Finished work</em> brings the clothes from the laundry ready to put away.</p>
  <p><em>Rough-dry</em> laundering means that the clothes are ready to be dampened for
    ironing.</p>
  <p><em>Wet-wash</em> service brings the clothes to the home ready to be put on the line
    for drying.</p>
  <p><em>Flat work</em> in laundry refers to bed linen, table linen, and like pieces.
    This is generally rated by the dozen or pound and at comparatively low prices.</p>
  <p>188. <strong>Community Laundries</strong>.&#8212;More and more the idea of community laundries
    is becoming popular. Often a few families, perhaps three, equip a room in
    one of the homes with modern apparatus, secure some one as professional laundress,
    and in this way have all their laundry work done by the most up-to-date methods
    and by a great saving of time, money, and peace of mind.</p>
  <p>In a surprisingly short time, a well-equipped home laundry begins to pay
    for itself. Consequently, it is possible for any woman who understands laundry
    work and who desires to make it a means  of livelihood, to set herself up
    in business and in a short time have a home-laundry business that is thriving.</p>

  <h2>HOME LAUNDERING</h2>
  <h2>Need
  for Cleaning Knowledge</h2>
  <p>1. The laundering of fabrics is a problem that every homemaker has to meet,
    and every woman who has ever met this problem will admit that it is not easy
    to solve. The scope of the laundry question is far more comprehensive than
    would at first be imagined. It deals not only with the processes that go
    to make up washing and wash-day, but also with the details of removing the
    many different kinds of stains, the equipment necessary for all processes,
    and the value of the various cleaning agents. An understanding of the nature
    and uses of the fabrics upon which one works is essential, too, for wool
    differs in its make-up from cotton, linen, and silk, which in turn differ
    from one another, and the soil on table linens differs from that on body
    linens. Consequently, in order that all fabrics may be cleansed according
    to their need and in the most economical and effective way, the proper choice
  of methods for the different circumstances must be made.</p>
  <p>2. There are two methods of cleaning garments; laundering or cleansing with
    soap and water, and dry or French cleaning, which consists in using certain
    solvents and absorbents to cleanse fabrics. Both methods are usable on some
    fabrics, but generally one is more feasible than the other. The style of
    the garment, as well as its material and purpose, has its influence on the
    choice of a cleaning agent. Soap and water sometimes affect the fit or fashion,
    as well as the color and texture of clothing, so certain articles cannot
    be entrusted to the tub; but the majority of materials in ordinary use in
    the household, as well as warm-weather clothing, children's garments, and
    body linens, are made to stand tubbing.</p>
  <p>3. In most homes, the laundering is done at home by the woman herself, the
    maid, or the laundress. Some women prefer to send the 
    clothes to a convenient laundry, but even in this plan there are certain
    articles that require special attention; so the homemaker invariably finds
    a supply of laundering materials and an understanding of laundering necessary
    to keep the garments and linens in good condition and to prolong their length
    of service.</p>
  <p>If only part of the family washing is done at home, it can be done at odd
    moments, but if all is done at home, then special thought must be expended
    to handle it efficiently. In this connection, a regular program, if decided
    on and followed, will save much time and energy.</p>
  <p>4. Since time immemorial it seems that wash-day has meant Monday and more
    often than not, &quot;Blue Monday&quot;; but of late 
    years Tuesday has been growing in popularity as wash-day. This plan leaves
    Monday as a day in which the housewife can replenish her larder and put her
    house in order after the Sunday's rest or entertaining. Also, it gives her
    time to look over her wash, mend the holes or tears that might become larger
    in the laundering, remove the stains that should have attention, prepare
    food with a view to having something for the next day, and in the evening
    place the washing apparatus and piles of clothes in readiness without infringing
    on the pleasures or quiet of Sunday. Then when Tuesday morning comes, no
    time need be lost because of the disorganization that 
    so often reigns in the house on Monday mornings. Such a program, regularly
    followed, will be found helpful in carrying out the laundering processes.</p>

  <h1>Dry Cleaning</h1>
  <h2>Meaning
  and Scope</h2>
  <p>1.    In the care of clothing, cleaning by soap and water is the most frequently
   employed process, and possibly the most valuable, but the possibilities for
   renovating by the method known as <strong>dry cleaning</strong>, or <em>French
   cleaning</em>, which
   is cleaning by means of absorbents and certain solvents, must not be overlooked.
   Dry cleaning has certain advantages that are not found in any other form of
   cleaning, chief among them being its harmlessness when applied to even the
   most delicate of fabrics or laces. Also, it does not affect color. It is these
   characteristics which have probably brought about the use of the term "dry cleaning," for,
   although the articles being cleaned are generally wet by the agent used, still
   the rapidity with which the evaporation takes place and the lack of effect
   from the wetting (except, of course, the removal of soil) has made general
   the use of a name that might lead to a wrong impression. However, it may truthfully
   be said that dry cleaning with the proper reagent does not affect the article
   any more than if it were not wet.</p>
  <p>2.    The terms <strong>spotting</strong> and <strong>stain removing</strong> must not be confused with dry
    cleaning. Dry cleaning is the more inclusive term, implying cleaning by immersing
    articles
     in gasoline or some similar solvent, and also in absorbents, while spotting,
     or stain removing, means the use of local applications to remove spots or
     stains on garments. Although spotting is in reality a distinct process in
     the care of clothing, it must also be considered as a step in both wet washing
     and dry washing, for many times garments show stains that must be removed
     before the all-over methods can be used with safety.</p>
  <p>3.    Because of the advantages of dry cleaning, its popularity has ever
    been on the increase, and new methods and new reagents have been adopted
    by way
       of advancement. With the increase in demand for it has come the founding
      of establishments devoted exclusively to this work, where all forms of
    dry cleaning
       are done at
    
comparatively reasonable prices. And many persons, because of the lack of knowledge
       concerning the newest, approved methods and because of a misconception
    concerning the difficulties and dangers in doing such work in the home, spend
    considerable
       money to have simple garments cleaned or discard good, but soiled, garments
       whose usefulness could have been prolonged. However, with a knowledge
    of the properties of the various cleaning agents, and with care in regard
    to
      a few
       simple details in handling such materials, even a novice can follow practically
       all of the dry-cleaning processes and feel reasonably sure of success.
    Such knowledge is set forth in this chapter in order that dry cleaning need
    not
       be considered a secret art, known only to a few, but may be added to the
      household lore of any woman who has the desire to be thrifty in the upkeep
      of her clothing.</p>

  <h2>Equipment
  for Dry Cleaning</h2>
  <p> <a href="illust/dc-25-04.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',610,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/dc-25-04-t.jpg" alt="Figure 4" width="220" height="162" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>45. In cleaning establishments, the simplest tools and the simplest
    recipes are universally used. The same simplicity should be observed in cleaning
      that is done in the home, both in the equipment and the method of procedure.
    The equipment shown in Fig. 4 includes all that is required for dry cleaning
    at home. As this illustration shows,
  practically all of this equipment is found in the average home.</p>
  <p>There need be no hesitancy in using the kettles and jars that are in every
    woman's kitchen if, when the work is complete, they are scoured thoroughly
  and allowed to air so that the odor entirely disappears.</p>
  <p>46. One of the secrets of successful home cleaning is to have <em>all working
    materials ready</em>, because gasoline, or any other cleaning fluid, evaporates
    rapidly and the process should not be delayed after it is once started. The
    articles that should be made ready are both listed and described.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>3 or 4 vessels with tight-fitting lids</li>
    <li> A large flat pan or a shallow sink</li>
    <li> Table and chairs</li>
    <li> Clothes hangers</li>
    <li> Clothes-pins</li>
    <li> Clothes-brushes or whisk-brooms</li>
    <li> Bath towels</li>
    <li> Cleaning fluid for bath</li>
    <li> Dry-cleaning soap</li>
    <li> Spotting reagents</li>
  </ul>
  <p>47. <strong>Vessels with well-fitting lids</strong> are almost indispensable for home dry
    cleaning, as the lids prevent evaporation. The vessels should also be large
    enough to allow for the handling of the stuffs to be cleaned. They may be
    medium-size dish pans with large, tin covers made close-fitting by placing
    weights on top. Or, if considerable cleaning is to be done, large aluminum
    vessels or large stone pots, such as are used in the chemical industry, would
    be excellent. If there are only a few light articles to be cleaned, 2 or
    3 half-gallon fruit jars will answer.</p>
  <p>48<a name="48" id="48"></a>. For spotting purposes, provide a <strong>large, flat pan</strong> of the dripper type.
    Or, if much cleaning is to be done, have a table with side pieces that extend
    above the level of the top. This forms a shallow sink when lined with zinc
    or tin. A hole may be bored in one corner, and a pipe connected to carry
    off the surplus cleaner.</p>
  <p>49. A <strong>table</strong> and <strong>two chairs</strong>, or still better, two tables, will provide space
    for sorting the various garments and for working.</p>
  <p>50. <strong>Clothes hangers</strong> and <strong>clothes-pins</strong> are generally required for drying purposes.</p>
  <p>51. <strong>Clothes-brushes</strong> or <strong>whisk-brooms</strong> found in every home, if thoroughly cleaned,
    are quite satisfactory. If brushes must be purchased, fine whisk-brooms and
    brushes with unpainted backs are best. A small, soft brush is particularly
    desirable for scrubbing fabrics. Wire brushes should be avoided.</p>
  <p>52. <strong>Bath towels</strong> are needed for drying the garments. These may be washed
    afterwards and need not be injured in any way by this work.</p>
  <p>53. The <strong>cleaning fluid</strong>, of whatever nature, should be provided in sufficient
    quantity, depending on the articles to be cleaned, usually 
    3 to 6 gallons. Remember that this, after being used, may be strained and
    used again for washing dark fabrics. Unless treated by a special process
    to make it entirely clean, however, this strained cleanser should not be
    used for cleaning white or light-colored garments.</p>
  <p><em><a href="illust/dc-27-05.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',598,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/dc-27-05-t.jpg" alt="Figure 5" width="220" height="159" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>Heated cleanser</em> is a great help, the garments being cleaned more easily
    in it than in a cold one. To heat the cleanser, put the vessel containing
    it into a larger vessel containing a few inches of boiling water, as shown
    in Fig. 5. Never attempt to heat a cleaning fluid by putting it near a fire
    or a flame, because of the danger.</p>
  <p>54. The <strong>soap</strong> for dry cleaning must be carefully chosen. A soap made especially
    to use with cleansers may be purchased, but considerable time is required
    to make it ready, and it is generally used only in dry-cleaning establishments.
    <em>Putnam Dry Cleaner</em> is very satisfactory, however, for home cleaning and is
    obtainable in almost all drug stores. In using Putnam Dry Cleaner or anything
    similar, put it into the cleanser that is used for the first washing.</p>

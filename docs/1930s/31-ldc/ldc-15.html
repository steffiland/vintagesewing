  <h5><a name="special" id="special"></a>SPECIAL PROCESSES</h5>
  <p><a name="shine" id="shine"></a>132. <strong>Removing Shine</strong>.&#8212;Besides removing shine by means
    of steam, several other methods can be followed with good results. Material
    that has become
    shiny may be restored by sponging with alcohol. If the material is seriously
    affected by shine, sponge the second time with ammonia and water in the proportion
    of 2 tablespoonfuls of ammonia to 1 cupful of warm water. Shine may be removed
    sometimes by simply brushing the fabric with a firm brush or by lightly drawing
    a piece of fine sandpaper over the surface to raise the nap.</p>
  <p><a name="bright" id="bright"></a>133. <strong>Brightening Color in Fabrics</strong>.&#8212;When the color of any fabric has
    been accidentally or otherwise faded by acid, apply ammonia to neutralize
    it and then restore it to its original color with a slight application of
    chloroform. To procure the best results in using these restoratives, a blotter
    should be placed under the fabric at the spot that is to be treated, so that
    all superfluous moisture will be absorbed.</p>
  <p><a name="black" id="black"></a>134. <strong>Freshening Black Goods</strong>.&#8212;Sponge with ammonia and press on the
    wrong side to give a fresh, new appearance to a black fabric.</p>
  <h5><a name="specific" id="specific"></a>PRESSING SPECIFIC GARMENTS</h5>
  <p><a name="coat" id="coat"></a>135. <strong>Men's Coats</strong>.&#8212;Place the coat on the board right
    side down and press just the facing sections, first on the button side and
    then on the
    buttonhole side, keeping the press cloth over the material. Next, turn the
    coat right side up and, beginning at the button side, turn the lapel flat,
    cover with a damp cloth, and press thoroughly, starting at the shoulder and
    working downwards. Be sure to press carefully between the buttons. After
    pressing, pull all edges into shape and turn the front edge inward with the
    fingers while the material is damp. Work around the coat, lifting the sleeve
    up to press under the arms. Treat the buttonhole side as the button side
    was treated; that is, press the lapel flat and, with the fingers, work the
    front edge to turn toward the coat.</p>
  <p>136. To press the <em>sleeves</em>, with the coat laid flat, arrange the sleeve so
    that when it is flat on the board the seam will come in the center of the
    under side. This plan will bring two creases in the sleeve, one at the front
    and one at the back, as is usually the case in sleeves in men's coats. When
    this side is pressed, turn the sleeve and press on the other side. Finally,
    finish the top of the sleeve where it joins the shoulder by placing it over
    a ham cushion or the small end of the board and pressing.</p>
  <p>If a sleeve without a crease is desired, use a sleeve board. Simply draw
    the sleeve over the board and press, finally finishing the top.</p>
  <p>137. The method of pressing the <em>lapel section</em> of the coat depends on whether
    it is to be flat or rolled.</p>
  <p>For a flat finish, start at the button side and crease the lapel from the
    first button around the collar to the first buttonhole on the other side.
    Place a damp press cloth over the lapel and collar and press, working the
    collar around on the board and shaping the edge with the fingers.</p>
  <p>For a roll finish, press the lapel sections, pressing out from the seam
    that joins the collar, and then steam this lightly. While damp, turn back
    the lapels and shape carefully.</p>
  <p>Hang up the coat for fifteen minutes before wearing, so that it may dry
    thoroughly.</p>
  <p>138. <strong>Overcoats</strong>.&#8212;Men's overcoats should be pressed in the same manner
    as their short coats.</p>
  <p>139. <strong>Women's and Children's Coats</strong>.&#8212;All coats for women and misses
    are pressed also as directed for men's coats, but if the fronts are shaped
    over the bust, use a ham cushion to give a smooth effect.</p>
  <p>The sleeves of women's coats are generally pressed without a crease.</p>
  <p><a name="vest" id="vest"></a>140. <strong>Vests</strong>.&#8212;To press vests, start at the button side and proceed,
    as in pressing a coat, around the garment to the buttonhole side.</p>
  <p><a name="trousers" id="trousers"></a>141. <strong>Trousers</strong>.&#8212;Place the top of trousers over the small end of the
    ironing board with the front opening button-side up. Using a cloth over the
    material, press from this opening around to the hip, then over the back portion
    to the other hip, and then to the front opening.</p>
  <p>Next, press the legs of the trousers. If the knees are baggy, lay the trousers
    flat, front side of legs up, and press one at a time from seam to seam over
    the baggy portion, using a cloth that is quite damp in order to shrink the
    material. Then, lay the crease in the legs. To do this, place one leg on
    the board with seams together and lay the crease from the bottom of the trouser
    leg in a direct line to the suspender button or belt strap nearest the front.
    Place the press cloth lengthwise over the trouser leg and press from the
    bottom upward to the crotch. Press the cloth dry, especially on the creased
    edges in order to set the crease as permanently as possible. If the garment
    should become slightly glossy, steam lightly.</p>
  <p>Now turn the trousers so that the pressed leg is laid out flat away from
    the worker and proceed to press the other leg as previously explained. When
    this is done, place the legs together and smooth out with the hands or press
    the outer sides lightly for a finish. Hang up for 15 minutes to dry.</p>
  <p><a name="knickers" id="knickers"></a>142. <strong>Knickers and Riding Breeches</strong>.&#8212;Knickers and riding breeches are
    pressed in the same way as men's trousers, except that allowance is made
    at the knees for the bands and the difference in shape.</p>
  <p><a name="skirts" id="skirts"></a>143. <strong>Plain Skirts</strong>.&#8212;Draw the skirt over the ironing board, right side
    down, and, starting at the opening, press around, pressing from the bottom
    toward the top. Keep the material covered with a slightly damp press cloth,
    pressing it dry. If necessary, go over, on the right side, any part of the
    skirt that may require it.</p>
  <p>144. <strong>Plaited Skirts</strong>.&#8212;To press a plaited skirt, turn to the wrong side,
    and pin the plaits in position at the bottom of the skirt, pinning them to
    the ironing board, and keeping the former creases as nearly as possible.
    If preferred, the plaits may be basted in before they are pinned to the board.
    Then, from the top, draw the skirt tight, and pin to the board along the
    top. Cover with a damp cloth and iron, pressing very firmly in order to fix
    the creases in the plaits. Repeat this process around the entire skirt. After
    removing the pins at the bottom, press over this part while the plaits are
    still in position in order to press them in well and remove the marks of
    the pins.</p>

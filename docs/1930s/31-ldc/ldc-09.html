  <h5>  <a name="scope" id="scope"></a>SCOPE AND EQUIPMENT</h5>
  <p>24. Frequently it is the stains or spots on fabrics, rather than the dust
    and soil from wear, that prompt cleaning. And often a fabric is so badly
    soiled that certain spots or stains must be removed before it can be either
    washed or dry cleaned. Consequently, <em>spotting</em> or <em>stain removing</em>, although
    a complete subject in itself, is here treated as the first step in dry cleaning,
    and the instruction concerning it is given previous to that on cleaning by
    immersion in dry-cleaning fluids.</p>
  <p>Another time when stain removing may take place is between the dry-cleaning
    baths. In the treatment of very soiled garments, several baths are sometimes
    necessary, and often when the garment comes out of the first bath the spots
    are much more visible, and therefore more easily removed, than before. They
    may appear again in the second bath, but should be treated again and again
    until no trace is left.</p>
  <p>25. To realize how important stain removing is, one has only to go into
    the dry-cleaning establishments and look into the stain-removing department.
    Every dry-cleaning establishment employs skilled workmen known as &quot;spotters,&quot; who
    do nothing but remove spots in garments, either before the first cleaning
    bath or between the baths. These men are the highest-paid workmen in the
    establishments.</p>
  <p>26. <strong>Spotting Reagents</strong>.&#8212;Numerous cleaning agents and cleaning mixtures
    are in use for spotting purposes. Some of these are commercial products,
    or prepared stain removers, which are obtainable at drug stores and which
    are easy to use because of the complete directions accompanying them. The
    aim here, however, is to give simply the materials easily obtainable and
    the methods easy of execution in the home. The most common agents have already
    been mentioned in Arts. <a href="ldc-08.html#6">6</a> to 23, inclusive.</p>
  <p>27. <strong>Equipment for Using Reagents</strong>.&#8212;To use spotting
    materials, provide the following equipment:</p>
  <p><em>A soft brush</em> for brushing soil from firm materials.</p>
  <p><em>Blotting paper</em>      or a <em>pad of old muslin</em> to lay under the spot.</p>
  <p><em>A medicine dropper</em> for applying the reagent.</p>
  <p><em>A tampon of cheesecloth</em> for applying the reagent.</p>
  <p><em>A small sponge</em> for applying cold water after using the reagent.</p>
  <p><em>Small, unpainted blocks of wood</em> with rounded edges may be procured or made,
    if much cleaning is to be done, to slip under spots that are being cleaned.</p>
  <p><em>An uncovered ironing board</em>, or one protected with a smooth, unpainted wooden
    cover over the padding, will also be found helpful to handle waists and skirts,
    as the garment may be turned easily on the board to clean the entire surface.</p>
  <h5><a name="stains" id="stains"></a>METHODS FOR REMOVING STAINS</h5>
  <p>28. <strong>Preliminary Cautions</strong>.&#8212;In removing stains, it
    is necessary to consider the kind and color of the material to be cleaned,
    the character of the stain,
    and its effect on the color. Know first your material, then know your stain,
    and if the cause of the spot is not known, experiment on a part of the article
    that will not be seen when it is being worn. Use the simplest reagents first
    and have them well diluted so that no stronger reagents than necessary are
     used. Never allow a reagent to remain in the material. Also, when using
    acids
    and such solutions as will be harmful if they spread, use a medicine dropper,
    since the smallest amount can then be dropped on, and confined entirely to,
the spot or stain.</p>
  <p>One of the secrets of successful stain removal is to have plenty of padding
    underneath the spot to absorb the liquid, and to change the pad as it becomes
    wet. Placing a stain downwards on the pad also helps, for then the stain
    can be forced out rather than drawn through the material to the other side.</p>
  <p>29. <strong>General Procedure</strong>.&#8212;In using chemicals, work quickly and give several
    slight applications over a pad of blotting paper or muslin. Rather than allow
    much moisture on the fabric, be sure to use blotting paper or muslin on top,
    also. After applying a chemical to washable material, dip the fabric into
    clear water or a prepared solution that will neutralize its effect, as the
    chemical may injure the material if left in.</p>
  <p>In cleaning silks, special care is necessary in the use of spotting agents,
    which should be applied in weak solution. A very good method is to outline
    the stain with a corner of a moistened cake of soap before beginning work,
    thus confining the action of the chemicals used. This, of course, can be
    done only on fabrics that will not be injured by the soap or that can be
    washed afterwards to remove the soap.</p>
  <p>In some cases, the stain is so bad or of such long standing that to attempt
    to remove it is practically useless. Then, it would be advisable to cover
    the stained portion, cut it out and applique something in place of it, or
    recut the article to dispense with the stain.</p>
  <p>30. <strong>Summary of Precautions</strong>.&#8212;In short, then, the precautions necessary
    to observe in spotting are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Consider the kind of material.</li>
    <li> Consider the color of material.</li>
    <li> Consider the nature of the stain.</li>
    <li> Use the simplest reagents first.</li>
    <li> Use weak solutions first.</li>
    <li> Use a medicine dropper.</li>
    <li> Provide plenty of padding.</li>
    <li> Change the padding frequently.</li>
    <li> Place a stain downwards and work from the wrong side.</li>
    <li> Work quickly.</li>
  </ul>
  <p> Never allow a reagent to remain in the fabric. Rinse reagents out with
                        water or use acids and alkalies to neutralize each other.</p>
  <p><a name="fresh" id="fresh"></a>31. <strong>Removing Fresh Stains</strong>.&#8212;Treating fresh stains immediately prevents
    the stain from spreading and sinking into the material. This fact cannot
    be too strongly emphasized, for it always means the saving of considerable
    time, energy, and cleanser, and may sometimes mean the saving of a fabric,
    because it is the lack of prompt attention that makes stains sometimes become
    so &quot;set&quot; that they can never be removed. Putting away a garment
    that has become soiled means increasing the difficulty of stain removal,
    and also the penalty that may have to be paid.</p>
  <p><a name="absorb" id="absorb"></a>32<a name="32" id="32"></a>. <strong>Using an Absorbent</strong>.&#8212;Covering fresh stains immediately with powdered
    French chalk, magnesia, bran, corn starch or one of the other recommended
    absorbents is a &quot;first-aid&quot; treatment that often proves all that
    is necessary.</p>
  <p>To use an absorbent, French chalk for example, lay the spotted article on
    white blotting paper or unglazed white cloth, pour the powder directly on
    the spot and keep changing the powder as it absorbs the soil. It is often
    well to place the chalk underneath as well as on the stain, for then absorption
    can take place in both directions.</p>
  <p>33. Using a warm iron will facilitate this form of cleaning, as it liquifies
    the grease or fats and renders the powder effective even on spots that have
    stood for some time. In this case, place the spot downwards on plenty of
    blotting paper and put French chalk over the spot; then iron over the chalk,
    using a warm rather than a hot iron. A hot iron will not only change the
    color of the fabric but also darken the grease.</p>
  <p>When absorption is slow and heat is not used, it is sometimes necessary
    to leave spots well covered with an absorbent for several days, changing
    the powder whenever necessary. Rare laces and old silks may take on a renewed
    appearance if allowed to stand in French chalk for several days.</p>
  <p>34. <strong>Using Water</strong>.&#8212;One of the safest cleaning agents to use is water,
    especially distilled water. Unless the character of the stain and the fabric
    calls for hot water, try cold water first, as hot water 
    may set the stain. Lay the stain on an absorbent surface and sponge with
    a lintless cloth, using a fast, circular motion.</p>
  <p><a href="illust/dc-11-01.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,311);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/dc-11-01-t.jpg" alt="Figure 1" width="97" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>If boiling water is to be used, as in the case of white goods having fresh
    coffee or fruit stains, also for lesser stains made by sugar and milk, or
    foods made of these ingredients, tie the stained article over a bowl so that
    the spot is over the center and pour boiling water from 
    a height, as shown in Fig. 1. Pouring from a height gives more power to the
    water in forcing the stain out.</p>
  <p><a name="gas" id="gas"></a>35. <strong>Using Gasoline</strong>.&#8212;For the 
    purpose of removing stains, particularly with gasoline, a <em>tampon</em> is a great
      convenience. To make this, form into a ball a piece of wadding the size
      of your fist, or smaller if light-weight fabrics are being cleaned, and
      place in the center of a piece of white, lintless cloth, tying this so
      that the corners can be used as a handle.</p>
  <p>Lay the soiled article on an absorbent pad. Dip the tampon into gasoline
    until it is thoroughly saturated and rub the dirtiest places until the greater
    portion of the dirt is removed. If several garments are to be cleaned in
    succession, work from the lighter to 
    the darker, for by repeatedly dipping the tampon in the gasoline the latter
    becomes darker. If the tampon becomes very soiled, make a new one.</p>
  <p>36. This method may be adapted to cleaning with naphtha, benzine, and the
    prepared cleansers. In sponging with cleaning oils, remember that they have
    no effect on sugar or syrup nor on stains in which these are a main cause.
    Also, as a general rule, do not use any of these cleansers on one section
    of a garment unless you expect to use it on the entire garment, and all at
    the same time. Sometimes, of course, they may be used to remove a spot when
     it is not desirable to clean the entire garment, but great care is necessary
    in doing this to prevent the formation of a ring. Remember, too, that gasoline
    is not an efficient cleaner for black.</p>
  <p><a name="alcohol" id="alcohol"></a>37<a name="37" id="37"></a>. <strong>Using Alcohol</strong>.&#8212;Black and dark colors have to be treated with special
    care, as they have a tendency to become lighter with spotting. Alcohol is
    generally preferred for them, as it gives a better resulting color even than
    gasoline. Some recipes recommend ether and chloroform, but both of these
    tend to take out color. Alcohol is the preferred cleaner for nearly all stains
    when the soap-and-water method is not desirable or where it fails.</p>
  <p>To prepare an <em>alcohol sponge</em>, put 2 tablespoonfuls of wood alcohol in 1
    cupful of boiling water and allow this to cool.</p>
  <p>Lay the material out on an absorbent pad or in a shallow pan, dip a tampon
    or a piece of cheesecloth into the alcohol, and then rub the spots thoroughly,
    rubbing around and around to prevent the forming of rings. Do this very gently
    so that the color will not be taken out.</p>
  <p>38. Sometimes ammonia is added to alcohol for sponging purposes. When this
    is the case, make the solution in the proportion of 1/4 cupful of household
    ammonia to 1 cupful of wood alcohol. Apply as directed in Art. <a href="#37">37</a>.</p>
  <p>Ether and chloroform may be used in the same manner as alcohol, as may also
    any other cleaner of the same volatile character that is not harmful if part
    is left in the materials.</p>
  <p>39<a name="39" id="39"></a>. <strong>Using Soap</strong>.&#8212;Often for heavy fabrics that can stand soap and water,
    the <em>soap sponge</em> is excellent. Pour boiling water over Ivory or castile soap
    that has been cut into small pieces. After 
    this has dissolved and cooled, apply in small quantities, using the directions
    given for an alcohol sponge.</p>
  <p><a name="commercial" id="commercial"></a>40. <strong>Using Commercial Stain Removers</strong>.&#8212;Prepared cleaning
    solutions are a great saving to the home cleaner, both in time and in money,
    for, unless
    considerable cleaning is to be done, it is necessary to keep on hand only
    a small quantity of the required materials. Then, too, having them already
    mixed properly for general use is a great help.</p>
  <p><a href="illust/dc-12--02.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',504,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/dc-12--02-t.jpg" alt="Figure 2" width="220" height="133" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>In using such a solution, it is well to spread the stained portion over
    a bowl of clear water and apply the stain remover with a tampon fastened
    over the end of a pencil, as shown in Fig. 2. After a sufficient application
    of the chemical to produce results, dip into the water the part of the material
    affected, as such solutions should be well rinsed out of the fabric.</p>
  <p class="clear"><a name="bleaches" id="bleaches"></a>41<a name="41" id="41"></a>. <strong>Using Bleaches for Removing Stains</strong>.&#8212;Very often it is not advisable
    to wash an entire garment to remove a small stain. In such case, the application
    of a bleaching solution such as Javelle water, borax, or potassium permanganate
    will prove effective, the proportions for which are given in Arts. <a href="ldc-04.html#170">170</a> to
    174, inclusive, Chapter I.</p>
  <p class="clear"><a href="illust/dc-13-03.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',421,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/dc-13-03-t.jpg" alt="Figure 3" width="220" height="110" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>To apply any one of these solutions, spread the article out on a padded
    surface or blotter, as shown in Fig. 3. Apply the bleach with the aid of
    a tampon; then, when the stain has disappeared, apply ammonia in the same
    manner. This counteracts the chemical action of the bleaching solution. Rinse
    with clear, cold water.</p>
  <p><a name="ring" id="ring"></a>42. <strong>Preventing the Formation of a Ring</strong>.&#8212;One or more of the following
    methods may be chosen to guard against the formation of rings:</p>
  <p>Strain liquids before using them.</p>
  <p> Rub around and around from the outside of the spot toward the center.</p>
  <p> Rub French chalk over the spot.</p>
  <p> Rub the finger nail carefully over the material.</p>
  <p>43. A ring is sometimes the result of impure solvents. Therefore, too much
    stress cannot be put on carefully straining the liquid cleaning agents before
    using them.</p>
  <p>It is sometimes possible to avoid the appearance of a ring, too, by the
    method used in doing the work. The practice of rubbing around and around
    from the outside of the spot and concentrating the absorption at the spot
    itself will sometimes prevent the formation of a ring. In such a procedure,
    the area covered by the cleaning fluid should be quite large to facilitate
    quick absorption. When the spot has been removed, soft, lintless cloths may
    be used to dry the material.</p>
  <p>If there is still a trace of the ring after this, it may often be taken
     away by rubbing French chalk over the spot. Leave this on for 2 
    or 3 hours to absorb the solvent, and then carefully brush it off.</p>
  <p>Sometimes a ring may be removed by rubbing the fabric carefully 
    with the finger nail to make it blend into the rest of the material.</p>
  <h5><a name="table" id="table"></a>TABLE OF STAIN REMOVAL</h5>
  <p>44. As an aid in stain removal, Table I, which gives the names of all common
    stains and the reagents and methods to use in removing them from different
    materials, is given. This information will prove very valuable and easily
    accessible, as the names of the stains are arranged in alphabetical order.</p>
  <p>In the use of this table, make reference to the more detailed directions
    governing the different solvents and absorbents. These directions immediately
    precede.</p>

  <h5>  <a name="equipment" id="equipment"></a>EQUIPMENT FOR PRESSING</h5>
  <p>68. Pressing gives the finishing touch to dry-cleaned garments, so it is
    essential that the work be done correctly. Too much stress cannot be laid
    on the warning not to rub the iron back and forth, but to run it over the
    garment but once. If the iron is sufficiently heavy, one pressing will be
    quite enough, but if it is light and must be rubbed back and forth, extra
    precautions must be taken or an ugly shine will result. Since dry-cleaned
    garments become shiny so easily, using press cloths becomes an actual necessity.</p>
  <p>69. If one is properly equipped to handle such work, pressing may be done
    as a business. Such equipment does not consist of unusual articles, but of
    such as will produce good work in the shortest possible time.</p>
  <p><strong>Irons</strong> are of chief importance, and regardless of whether electricity, gas,
    or coal heat is used, the irons should be heavy tailors' irons, weighing
    from 16 to 20 pounds to be most suitable.</p>
  <p>The <strong>ironing board</strong> must be very firm, well padded, and adjusted to a convenient
    height.</p>
  <p><strong>Press cloths</strong> should be large enough to cover all garments
    well, 1 1/4 yards of soft, unbleached muslin that has been boiled to remove
    filling being preferable.
    A special, clean cloth should always be kept for pressing white or light-colored
    materials.</p>
  <p>A <strong>sponge</strong> or <strong>small soft brush</strong> and a <strong>shallow
      pan</strong> to hold water to dampen the
    press cloth or parts of a garment are advisable.</p>
  <p>A <strong>sleeve board</strong> and a <strong>ham cushion</strong> or <strong>pressing
      pad</strong> are also helpful. The ham
    cushion is made of firm material in the shape of a ham and filled tightly
    with sawdust, or small scraps of cloth. It is used to press any rounded surfaces,
    such as fronts that are shaped over the bust and trouser tops.</p>
  <h5><a name="method" id="method"></a>METHOD OF PRESSING</h5>
  <p>70. The suggestions for ironing in Arts. <a href="ldc-04.html#107">107</a> to 115, <em>Home Laundering</em>, apply
    to all simple garments, but for tailored dresses, coats, and trousers, special
    treatment is necessary to give satisfactory results. The long, sweeping movements
    of the iron in ironing are not applicable to pressing, for they are likely
    to stretch the pliant fibers of some materials. Instead, the iron should
    be worked over small surfaces at a time with a motion away from you and gradually
    toward the bottom of the garment. Since tailored garments have few or no
    gathers, it is not necessary to press toward the gathers as in other garments.</p>
  <p>Although pressing is considered the principal method of finishing, steaming
    is very often employed, especially for materials that are likely to become
    shiny with the application of heat with pressure. The processes of steaming
    are fully described in Arts. <a href="ldc-13.html#80">80</a> to 83, inclusive.</p>
  <p><a name="hard" id="hard"></a>71. <strong>Hard-Finished Material</strong>.&#8212;To press hard-finished material, lay it
    out flat. Dampen the press cloth; then wring as dry as possible and shake
    to distribute the moisture thoroughly. Place the press cloth on top of the
    material and press hard with the iron, keeping it in motion so that it will
    not leave marks on the material. Continue until the press cloth is dry.</p>
  <p><a name="soft" id="soft"></a>72. <strong>Soft-Finished Material</strong>.&#8212;Soft-finished material, especially in
    blue, black, or other dark colors, requires a little different treatment
    in pressing, as there is danger of its becoming glossy. Place a slightly
    dampened press cloth over the material and press lightly 
    with the iron until the press cloth is almost dry. If the material should
    become glossy, remove such marks by steaming.</p>
  <p><a name="nap" id="nap"></a>73. <strong>Material With a Nap</strong>.&#8212;Material with a nap must have careful consideration
    in pressing. Dampen the press cloth, but do not have it too wet. Place over
    the material and press lightly, moving the iron always in the same direction;
    that is, with the nap of the material. If the material is not pressed in
    this way, it will have a rough surface. If the material is hung in the open
    air after pressing, the nap will be raised, thus giving it a softer finish.</p>
  <p><a name="pile" id="pile"></a>74. <strong>Pile Fabrics</strong>.&#8212;Fabrics having a deep pile should be steamed rather
    than pressed, as pressing will flatten the surface. Follow one of the methods
    of steaming given here.</p>

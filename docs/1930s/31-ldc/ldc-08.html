  <h5>  <a name="class" id="class"></a>CLASSIFICATION</h5>
  <p>5. There are two principal mediums by which the dry cleaner restores fabrics.
    These are known as <em>solvents</em> and <em>absorbents</em>.</p>
  <p>6<a name="6" id="6"></a>. <strong>Solvents</strong> are liquids that dissolve grease or gummy substances.
    Water is the principal solvent, but this belongs to wet washing. The solvents
    used
    in dry cleaning are often referred to, in the trade, as <em>cleaning oils</em>, but
    there are certain <em>volatile liquids</em>, <em>acids</em>    and <em>alkalies</em> that are equally indispensable, especially for spotting. In
some cases, a solvent belongs in more than one class.</p>
  <p>The following classification, although not exact as to chemical analysis,
    is a convenient one for the dry cleaner.</p>
<p><em>Water</em></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Cold water</li>
    <li>Hot water</li>
    <li>Distilled water</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Cleaning Oils</em></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Gasoline and similar cleaners</li>
    <li>Naphtha</li>
    <li>Benzine</li>
    <li>Benzene or benzol</li>
    <li>Kerosene</li>
    <li>Turpentine</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Volatile Liquids</em></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Alcohol
      <ul>
        <li>Wood</li>
        <li>Denatured</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Ether</li>
    <li>Chloroform</li>
    <li>Carbon tetrachloride</li>
    <li>Acetone</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Acid Materials</em></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Oxalic acid</li>
    <li>Hydrochloric acid</li>
    <li>Potassium permanganate</li>
    <li>Hydrosulphite of soda</li>
    <li>Hydrogen peroxide</li>
    <li>Chloride of lime</li>
    <li>Javelle water</li>
    <li>Vinegar</li>
    <li>Lemon juice</li>
    <li>Salts of lemon</li>
    <li>Sour milk</li>
    <li>Buttermilk</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Alkaline Materials</em></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Soap</li>
    <li>Ammonia</li>
    <li>Borax</li>
    <li>Sal soda</li>
    <li>Egg white</li>
    <li>Sweet milk</li>
  </ul>
  <p>7. <strong>Absorbents</strong>, as the name indicates, take up rather than dissolve the particles
    of dirt. Therefore they are, for the most part, dry cleaners that come in
    powder, or pulverized, form. They are most successful when applied on fresh
    stains or on such articles as furs, out of which the soil can be brushed
    with the absorbent.</p>
  <p>According to nature and color, absorbents may be classified as follows: </p>
  <p><em>White Powder</em> </p>
  <ul>
    <li>French chalk</li>
    <li>Magnesia</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Kitchen Supplies</em></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Meals</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Starch</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Non-Plastic Clay</em></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Fullers' earth</li>
    <li>Pipe clay</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Absorbent Surfaces</em></p>
  <ul>
    <li>White blotting paper</li>
    <li>Unglazed paper</li>
    <li>Unglazed cloth</li>
  </ul>
  <h5><a name="solvent" id="solvent"></a>SOLVENTS</h5>
  <p>8. <strong>Water</strong>.&#8212;Although <strong>water</strong> is not generally associated with dry cleaning,
    it has a very definite place in spotting. Pure <em>cold water</em> removes spots,
    as, for example, raw-meat stains, and <em>hot water</em> removes spots made by sugar,
    starches, milk, dust, and some fruits. Also, water is used after many reagents
    to rinse them thoroughly.</p>
  <p><em>Distilled water</em> is the safest kind to use, for all foreign matter has been
    removed from it by the distilling process. It is the presence of foreign
    matter, or the leaving of residue, that causes the formation of rings. Water
    may be distilled by condensing steam, or it may be freed from part of the
    foreign matter by boiling it and then straining through firm muslin or filter
    paper, obtainable at many stores. Distilled water may be purchased at garages
    and drug stores.</p>
  <p>9. <strong>Cleaning Oils</strong>.&#8212;Practically all cleaning agents of the quick-evaporating
    type are derivatives of petroleum. Of these, the one that is perhaps most
    widely known is gasoline. The cleaning power of this solvent was discovered
    in 1866 by a Frenchman, Monsieur Judlin, and since that time it has been
    in continuous use for this purpose. Naturally improvements have been sought
    to make gasoline more acceptable and pleasing to its users, especially since
    dry cleaning has become more generally practiced in the home. The results
    have been very gratifying, for it is now possible to procure cleaning fluids,
    put up in convenient-size tins, that are non-inflammable, quick drying, and
    have rapidly disappearing odors. Directions accompany the cleansers, which,
    if accurately followed, will make the cleaning of garments in the home a
    simple and readily accomplished process. These commercial cleaning fluids
    are more expensive than gasoline, but the satisfaction they give more than
    repays for their cost.</p>
  <p>10. <strong>Naphtha</strong> also is a product of petroleum, which, during refining processes,
    distils at a lower temperature than gasoline. Because of its greater refinement,
    it is dangerously inflammable, consequently its use should be avoided, if
    possible. If naphtha must be employed, never use it indoors or in the direct
    rays of the sun because even the sun's heat may cause it to ignite. Naphtha
    dissolves fats, turpentine, varnish, asphalt, and rubber.</p>
  <p>11. <strong>Benzine</strong> is highly refined gasoline and is exceptionally
    effective as a cleaner. However, it is practically impossible to 
    obtain benzine in its pure form, and the oil sold under that name at drug
    stores should not be trusted, as it is no more than a low grade of gasoline.
    Benzine and naphtha are sometimes sold as one and the same thing, and can
be used interchangeably, but benzine is not so highly refined.</p>
  <p>12. <strong>Benzene, or benzol</strong>, which is the trade term, is a coal-tar product and
    must not be confused with benzine. It acts like naphtha except that it evaporates
    more rapidly and therefore is less likely to leave any trace on even the
    most delicate fabrics.</p>
  <p>13. <strong>Kerosene</strong> is a colorless, inflammable oil having solvent
    and bleaching qualities. When petroleum oil is being distilled, kerosene
    passes over after
naphtha and gasoline. </p>
  <p> Kerosene dissolves gummy substances and wax and serves as a bleaching agent
  in wet washing.</p>
  <p>14. <strong>Turpentine</strong> is an oil made from the pitch-pine tree. After the bark has
    been removed, the pitch is collected and distilled with water. What passes
    over is oil, or spirits, of turpentine and what remains is rosin. When fresh,
    turpentine is clear in color and not strong smelling, but as it grows older,
    exposure to air turns it dark in color and gives it a strong odor. When in
    this state, it should not be used for dry-cleaning purposes, as it will leave
    a stain.</p>
  <p>When turpentine is fresh and when it has been kept well corked, it dissolves
    grease, wax, tar, varnish, and paint. It is useful also in wet washing for
    whitening clothes.</p>
  <p>15. <strong>Volatile Liquids</strong>.&#8212;<strong>Alcohol</strong> is a colorless, volatile, inflammable
    liquid having cleaning properties. <em>Wood</em>, or <em>methyl</em>, alcohol, which is distilled
    from wood and is the simplest form of alcohol, dissolves gums and varnishes
    and is in general use as a stain remover. <em>Denatured alcohol</em>, which is <em>grain</em>    or <em>ethyl</em> alcohol made unfit for beverages by the addition of poisonous materials,
    is a solvent for fats, resins, and oils. Both kinds of alcohol are in general
    use, particularly on black and dark-colored materials.</p>
  <p>16. <strong>Ether, chloroform</strong>, and <strong>carbon tetrachloride</strong> are colorless, highly volatile
    liquids formed by distilling certain acids and water. They are solvents of
    fats, oils, and resins and removers of soil, evaporating so quickly that
    they do not leave rings, unless, of course, they are old and dark. With the
    exception of ether, they are not inflammable; but all are anesthetics, so
    must not be used 
    except where there is free circulation of air. Since these are expensive
    reagents, their use is confined to spotting.</p>
  <p>Carbon tetrachloride is an ideal cleaning fluid because it is non-combustible
    and leaves practically no after odor, its expense being the only drawback.
    As an economical measure, it is sometimes mixed with a cheaper cleaning fluid,
    such as gasoline.</p>
  <p>Ether and chloroform affect dyes, so therefore fade color.</p>
  <p>17. <strong>Acetone</strong> is another dissolver of fats, oils, and resins. It evaporates
    nearly as quickly as carbon tetrachloride, acts with nearly as much efficacy,
    and is cheaper, but has the disadvantage of being inflammable.</p>
  <p>18. <strong>Acid Materials</strong>.&#8212;Certain <strong>acids</strong> and <strong>acid
      materials</strong> are considered
    as solvents because of their effect on certain stains, especially those made
    by alkalies. Among these acids are <em>oxalic acid, hydrochloric acid, potassium
    permanganate, hydrosulphite of soda, hydrogen peroxide</em>, and <em>chloride
    of lime</em>,
    which is used in the making of <em>Javelle water</em>. All of these acids have more
    or less powerful bleaching qualities, but when Javelle water and potassium
    permanganate are used, the former must be treated with an after application
    of ammonia water, and the latter with hydrogen peroxide or ammonia water,
    so that no acid will remain to eat the fabric.</p>
  <p><em>Vinegar, lemon juice, salts of lemon, sour milk</em>, and <em>buttermilk</em> also, are
    largely acid in their composition and effect, and are numbered among the
    solvents of stubborn stains.</p>
  <p>19. <strong>Alkaline Materials</strong>.&#8212;When the stain is an acid stain, an alkali
    should be chosen to treat it, because of the opposite, or neutralizing, effect
    that acids and alkalies have on each other. Among the <strong>alkalies</strong> that are of
    value as dry-cleaning agents, there are, first of all, the <em>soaps</em> manufactured
    for use with cleaning oils. Then there are <em>ammonia, borax</em>, and <em>sal
    soda</em>,
    which is the crystalline form of baking soda. <em>Sweet milk</em> and <em>egg
    whites</em> are
    other alkalies whose effect on certain stains should be a part of one's dry-cleaning
    knowledge.</p>
  <h5><a name="absorb" id="absorb"></a>ABSORBENTS</h5>
  <p>20. The absorbent in most common use is <strong>powdered French 
    chalk</strong>, which is in reality ground soapstone, a very resinous mineral. It
      is inexpensive and highly absorbent of grease, dust, and coloring matter.</p>
  <p>French chalk can be mixed with turpentine, benzine, or any other cleaning
    oil to form a paste, and then used in this form, particularly on dry spots.</p>
  <p>21. <strong>Magnesia</strong> is similar to French chalk in appearance and in use, as it
    is a light, white, earthy powder that can be used dry or combined with a
    solvent to make a paste.</p>
  <p>22. <strong>Fullers' earth</strong> and <strong>pipe clay</strong> are of the same family, each being a non-plastic
    clay effective in absorbing grease. The chief difference between them is
    that pipe clay is white and fullers' earth is light brown. Both absorbents
    can be mixed with a solvent to make a thick paste for more difficult stains.</p>
  <p>23. Some kitchen supplies, such as <strong>meals, salt, starch</strong> (but never flour),
    do duty as removers of various stains. Also, <strong>white blotting paper,
    unglazed paper</strong>, and <strong>unglazed cloth</strong> will act as absorbents on fresh spots or when heat
    is applied to them. They may be used to gather up the worst of a stain, and
    something else used to take out the remainder. Blotting paper is sometimes
    shredded, and then crumpled to give it more irregular surfaces and make it
    more absorbent.</p>

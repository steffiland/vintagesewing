  <h5>  <a name="pgm" id="pgm"></a>PROGRAM FOR LAUNDRY WORK</h5>
  <p><a name="69" id="69"></a>69. Laundry work may be done in a haphazard way and perchance turn out satisfactorily,
    but such a result must be considered more nearly a coincidence than a direct
    result. It cannot be relied on to happen every wash-day. Instead, it is the
    systematically done laundry work that can guarantee success. But this does
    not mean that superfluous time must be consumed in elaborate processes. The
    methods may be thorough and systematic and yet direct and expeditious.</p>
  <p>70. Following is a program that has proved its worth as a guide through

  <h5><a name="sorting" id="sorting"></a>SORTING THE CLOTHES</h5>
  <p>71. In laundering, it is necessary first to sort the clothes, as different
    handling is required for white and colored garments and for cotton, linen,
    wool, and silk. A good classification to use in sorting is as follows: Table
    linen, kitchen linen, bed linen, body linen, colored clothes, flannels, silks,
    and hosiery.</p>
  <p>72. At the very first, the articles to be washed should be examined carefully,
    so that fancy buttons or, in fact, any trimming that would be harmed by water
    may be removed. Stitches holding drapery or linings should be loosened to
    simplify cleansing and ironing. Also, during the sorting of clothes, attention
    should be given to garments containing pockets. Turn the pockets inside out
    and brush thoroughly to remove any particles of dust that may have collected.</p>
  <p>73. The white pieces of cotton or linen may be laundered with ordinary precautions,
    but silk and wool garments and colored clothes require particular attention.
    A difference in handling is necessary because cotton and linen are made of
    vegetable fibers whereas silk and wool are composed of animal fibers, and
    animal fibers are more susceptible to injury from strong soaps and hot water
    than are vegetable fibers.</p>
  <p>While the clothes are being sorted, look them over carefully for stains
    and spots, and see that these are removed before the garments are washed,
    as removing stains at this time saves an extra handling and prevents the
    stain from being transferred to other garments. The subject of stain removing,
    or &quot;spotting,&quot; is treated in the Section on <em>Dry Cleaning</em>.</p>
  <h5><a name="cotton" id="cotton"></a>WASHING WHITE COTTONS AND LINENS</h5>
  <p>74. <strong>Soaking</strong>.&#8212;It is advisable to soak white clothes for a few hours
    (some prefer over night), for soaking loosens the dirt, makes less rubbing
    necessary, and therefore saves both time and wear. A very simple way to soak
    white clothes is to cover them with warm water early in the morning. Then,
    when one is ready to go on with the washing, more hot water may be added
    to that already used and the clothes may be washed easily.</p>
  <p>If clothes are to be soaked over night, use cold water rather than warm,
    because warm water expands the fibers of the fabric, brings the dirt to the
    surface, and then, during the night, cools and closes the fibers so that
    by morning the dirt is held very tightly in the fabric and is difficult to
    loosen again.</p>
  <p>When clothes are soaked over night, soap the very soiled parts as they are
    put into the tub. Some persons roll the soaped articles, this plan being
    very satisfactory although it takes more time.</p>
  <p>If you have only hard water to use, treat it by one of the methods suggested
    in Arts. <a href="ldc-03.html#66">66</a>, <a href="ldc-03.html#67">67</a>, and <a href="ldc-03.html#68">68</a> before you attempt to soak clothes in it. Otherwise,
    a scum will form and settle on the clothes. Soap, of course, helps to prevent
    the forming of the scum.</p>
  <p>75. <strong>Washing</strong>.&#8212;After soaking the clothes, put them into a tub half full
    of hot, soapy water and rub them on a washboard, or, if you have a washing
    machine, put them in that. In either case, when the soap has been &quot;killed&quot; by
    a quantity of clothes passing through the suds and the water is cold, change
    to warm, fresh suds. 
    No suds and cold water make lifeless, heavy laundry; therefore, rejuvenate
    by new, hot suds. The results repay many times for the effort.</p>
  <p><em>If a washboard is used</em>, do not rub too vigorously, as this may injure the
    fabric. The idea is to force the suds through the clothes and thus carry
    the dirt away. Consequently, the portions being rubbed should be dipped almost
    constantly in the suds, so that there will be no rubbing of the material
    after the water has been squeezed out. For very coarse goods, a hand brush
    will prove helpful. Another point to remember is that the soiled parts of
    the clothes should be rubbed on one side and then turned and rubbed on the
    other side. Rubbing with the palm of the hand will save the skin on the knuckles.</p>
  <p>76. <em>If a washing machine is used</em>, the book of directions that pertain to
    that particular washer should be carefully studied. Nearly every machine
    has a water line marked on it to indicate the maximum amount of water permissible.
    The number of garments may be such that, when pressed down, they will be
    an inch below this water level. Never fill a washer too full, not only because
    the mechanism will be injured, but also because the free movement of the
    clothes will be hindered.</p>
  <p>77. The <em>amount of soap</em> must be determined by the hardness of the
    water, and can be gauged almost exactly by each housewife. By weighing the
    clothes
    each wash-day and trying out different amounts of soap, she can determine
    how much is necessary to make suds that will &quot;hold&quot; up during the
    washing and yet not be so heavy as to adhere to the fibers of the materials
    and make the removing of the dirt more difficult. Of course, the soap should
    be liquid to obtain the best results, either the soap chips or the soap jelly
    discussed in Art. <a href="ldc-03.html#52">52</a> being satisfactory.</p>
  <p>78. <strong>Boiling</strong>.&#8212;If white cotton or linen clothes are very much soiled
    or if it seems desirable to sterilize them, they may be boiled. After first
    washing in hot water, therefore, wring the clothes, rub the soiled spots
    carefully with white soap, and place in a boiler containing cold water. Put
    a few soap chips or a little soap jelly into each boiler full of clothes,
    and heat the water gradually. Use a clothes-stick to keep the clothes stirred
    and pressed down. After the water has begun to boil, allow the clothes to
    remain in it about five minutes. Boiling for a longer time tends to turn
    fabrics yellow.</p>
  <p>If the garments are very soiled, from 1 to 4 tablespoonfuls of kerosene
    may be put into the water when boiling to aid in cleansing. Thorough rinsing
    is required in such case to remove all traces of the kerosene.</p>
  <p>Another helpful fact to know is that the carefully strained juice of one
    or two lemons added to a boiler of clothes will help to whiten them.</p>
  <p>79. <strong>Rinsing</strong>.&#8212;After taking clothes from soapy water, very careful rinsing
    is essential. It is advisable to rinse in clear hot water, but this is not
    always practical, as usually lukewarm water is more easily provided. In either
    case, shake out each piece carefully to remove all soap. Repeat the rinsing
    process at least twice, and preferably three times, because the removal of
    the soapy water has much to do with the efficiency of cleansing and the freshness
    of the clothes when dry. An ideal way is to have the first rinse water hot
    and the successive rinse waters gradually grow colder so as to prepare the
    clothes for the bluing. All soap must be removed by these rinsings; otherwise
    the clothes will be spotted when the bluing comes in contact with the alkali
    of the soap.</p>
  <p>Do not use washing soda to soften the rinse water, as it is too strong to
    be left in the fabric. A little borax may be used in the first and second
    rinse waters; but, after the soap has been removed, there is no need for
    a water softener, for it is only in the presence of soap that a scum is formed.</p>
  <p>80. <strong>Bluing</strong>.&#8212;Since the bluing process is resorted to for the purpose
    of covering up yellowness, it is not necessary for new clothes. But bluing
    white clothes that are no longer new is an important item of good laundering.
    Just how much bluing is required must be determined by each housewife as
    she takes into account the kind of bluing and the nature of the articles
    to be blued. For example, open-mesh fabrics and table linens take up bluing
    more quickly than do materials of a firmer weave.</p>
  <p>At all times, great care must be taken not to have the blue water too dark
    or to leave the articles in it too long, for too much bluing acts as a handicap,
    making the clothes gray rather than white. If it does happen that clothes
    become overblued, they may be whitened by placing them in cold water and
    heating them to the boiling point, repeating the process if necessary until
    all excess bluing is removed.</p>
  <p>81. If you are one of the housewives who use powdered or lump blue, then
    be sure to take great care to add a small amount of water to the powdered
    blue before use and to tie ball, or lump, blue in small cloth bags, which
    may be dipped and squeezed in the water before using. Otherwise, the blue
    is likely to be unevenly distributed and cause spots to form on the clothes.
    In spite of these precautions, there will be this tendency unless a very
    few clothes are put in at one time and these kept in motion.</p>
  <p>If you use the liquid Prussian blue, remember that it contains salts of
    iron that turn to iron-rust in the presence of the alkali from soap, particularly
    when heat is applied, as in ironing, for example. Consequently, to avoid
    iron-rust stains on the material, take every care to have the clothes thoroughly
    rinsed so that all traces of soap are removed before bluing.</p>
  <p>82. No matter what kind of bluing is used, the following cautions should
    be observed:</p>
  <p>Use a small amount of bluing in a large amount of water.    </p>
  <p>Keep it stirred well.      </p>
  <p>Shake the clothes thoroughly before they are put into it.</p>
  <p>Do not allow clothes to remain in the water too long; unless clothes are
    very yellow, sousing them up and down two or three times should give them
    enough bluing.</p>
  <p>A helpful point to know about the use of bluing is that 1/4 to 1/2 cupful
    of skimmed milk added to the bluing water helps to prevent the bluing from
    streaking clothes.</p>
  <p>83. <strong>Starching</strong>.&#8212;Starching clothes means dipping them in a stiffening
    agent to give them body and a dressing similar to that in new material, and
    also to aid in keeping them clean. When it is desirable, this is done after
    rinsing and bluing. The stiffer you want the article, the more thoroughly
    you must wring the rinse or bluing water from it, and the less thoroughly
    you must wring the stiffening agent from it.</p>
  <p>The stiffening agent to use and the amount needed vary according to the
    kind of fabric and the stiffness desired. Also, the number of pieces to be
    put through the starch must be considered.</p>
  <p>Of the kinds of stiffening available, discussion has been given in Arts.
    <a href="ldc-03.html#60">60</a> and <a href="ldc-03.html#61">61</a>. In order to become efficacious, these stiffening agents require
    preparation according to stated formulas or recipes, 
    making a further division, that of the cooked and uncooked varieties, necessary.</p>
  <p>84. For general laundry purposes, <em>cooked starch</em> is the customary standby.
    Following is a general recipe for cooked starch, which may be varied to suit
    one's needs.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>1 to 4 tablespoonfuls starch </li>
    <li>1 quart boiling water        </li>
    <li>1 cupful cold water </li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoonful paraffin or lard</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Blend the starch and cold water to a smooth paste, and then gradually pour
    in the boiling water. Add the paraffin or lard next. Boil the mixture until
    clear, stirring constantly, generally for 5 to 10 minutes. Strain while hot.
    If 1/2 teaspoonful of borax is added with the paraffin or lard, it will help
    to whiten the clothes and also make the starch smoother.</p>
  <p>For a stiff dressing, the starch should be made very heavy; that is, more
    starch should be used in the mixture. When cooled enough to handle, such
    starch should be like a very soft jelly.</p>
  <p>85. <em>Uncooked</em> or <em>cold starch</em> also has its place in laundry work, although,
    because of the difficulty in ironing garments starched in this way, it is
    wiser to use a stiff cooked dressing, which produces practically the same
    results.</p>
  <p>There are various brands of commercial starch to use for cold starching.
    Such starches are simply blended with cold water and are generally used for
    collar bands and cuffs, or wherever a firm, stiff finish is desired.</p>
  <p><a name="86" id="86"></a>86. <em>Borax dressing</em> is used to stiffen laces, fine voiles, or organdies.
    A solution of borax made with 1 teaspoonful of borax to 1 quart of hot water
    is very satisfactory.</p>
  <p>Garments stiffened by borax must be ironed before they have dried, as the
    dressing is not heavy enough to warrant the dilution caused by sprinkling.</p>
  <p><a name="87" id="87"></a>87. <em>Gum arabic</em> makes a good stiffening agent for crisp lawns and organdies,
    particularly in dark colors. It may be purchased in powdered or lump form,
    but if possible the powder should be procured. Let 1 or 1 1/2 tablespoonfuls
    stand in a quart of hot water until dissolved. Strain the solution and, when
    needed, use 1/4 cupful to 1 quart of water for average stiffness.</p>
  <p>In using this dressing, allow the garment to dry after washing and then
    wet it thoroughly with the gum-arabic solution. Allow 
    it to dry again and then dampen for ironing. Roll the garment treated with
    the gum arabic firmly in a towel, and after it has stood 15 to 30 minutes,
    iron as you would iron a starched garment.</p>
  <p>88. <em>Rice water</em> forms another medium for stiffening laces. To prepare this
    dressing, wash 2 tablespoonfuls of rice until it is perfectly clean, and
    put it in a saucepan with 1 1/2 pints of water. Boil 4 minutes, strain, and
    then allow the lace to stand in this water for a minute or two. Iron the
    lace from the wrong side while damp, placing a damp cloth over it at first.</p>
  <p>89. In the <em>process of stiffening</em>, the following precautions should be noted:</p>
  <p>The hotter the starch is, the less danger there is of its sticking.</p>
  <p>Turn the garments wrong side out before dipping them into the solution and
    hang them on the line in this way.</p>
  <p>Wring out as dry as possible from the rinse or bluing water all garments
    that are desired to be very stiff, and be sure that these are the first things
    to be dipped into the starch.</p>
  <p>Put white clothes into the starch while it is very hot.</p>
  <p>In starching a garment or part of a garment with heavy starch, dry the garment
    first and then starch it. Rub the starch in thoroughly until every part of
    the material, even though there are several thicknesses, has taken up enough
    to be wet. Then stretch the surface, smooth it, and wipe off all shining
    starch with a soft, damp cloth. The garment is then ready for finishing with
    a hot iron.</p>
  <p><a href="illust/hl-35.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,472);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/hl-35-t.jpg" alt="Hanging clothes to dry" width="151" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>90. <strong>Hanging Clothes to Dry</strong>.&#8212;To some it might seem that the laundry
    work is practically done when clothes are ready to be hung on the line; but
    the next step has some very important features, the oversight of which might
    make necessary the rewashing of articles.</p>
  <p>One of the chief virtues of proper drying of clothes is the effect that
    sun and air have on them. When clothes are hung on the line quite wet, almost
    dripping in fact, the combined action of sun and air is one of the best bleaches
    known. It is because of this that white clothes should be hung, when possible,
    out-of-doors, and that colored clothes should be hung in the shade or indoors.</p>
  <p>91. To save time in the sorting of articles for ironing, hang all garments
    of a kind together. Then, to have the clothes dry in the best possible condition,
    keep in mind the following <em>general directions</em>:</p>
  <p>Be sure that the clothes-line and pins are perfectly clean.</p>
  <p>Shake things out well and turn outer garments, if they have not already
    been turned, wrong side out.</p>
  <p>Hang large pieces, such as sheets and table-cloths, on a straight thread
    of the material, one-fourth or one-half of each over the line, 
    and fasten with four or five clothes-pins. Sheets may be doubled crosswise,
    so that the upper and lower hems meet, and pinned to the line by the hems,
    to minimize the danger of hems being torn by the wind.</p>
  <p>Fold flat pieces as they are taken off the line, as then they will be easier
    to iron.</p>
  <p>Take starched clothes from the line as soon as they are dry, as long hanging
    will cause them to lose their stiffness and make them more difficult to iron.
    Also, as a brisk 
    wind will take out the starch, be sure to make it rather heavy on 
    windy days.</p>
  <p>92. Authorities differ as to the proper method of <em>hanging dresses and
      blouses</em>    on the clothes-line. If there is plenty of room, garments may be hung lengthwise;
    that is, held to the line by clothes-pins at the shoulder, the waist line,
    and the hem. A garment will dry more quickly, however, if hung by the hem,
    and, if the position on the line is changed at least once, there will not
    be much danger of stretching. Circular skirts, or flared effects, will sag
    if this is done, but most wash frocks are cut on comparatively straight lines
    so this need not be considered.</p>
  <p>Very sheer dresses may be placed over a hanger that has first been wound
    and padded with a strip of clean old muslin or Turkish toweling. The hanger
    may be hung over the line and held fast by a 
    clothes-pin. If possible, always dry delicate materials in the shade, but
    if no shade is available, hang the garment inside where there is a free circulation
    of air.</p>
  <p>93. In <em>freezing weather</em>, wash the clothes-line and pins with strong salt
    water and do not rinse it off. The salt will prevent the clothes from freezing
    to the line.</p>
  <p>Another way in which to add to the comfort of winter laundry work is the
    following: Place a large hook on each of two posts or trees a convenient
    distance apart. Prepare a length of clothes-line rope just long enough to
    extend from one to the other of these with a loop at each end. While you
    are still in the house, pin this loose, short length of rope full of small
    articles, such as handkerchiefs, stockings, etc., and place it on top of
    the basket of clothes. It may be hung on the two hooks very quickly without
    making the hands cold.</p>
  <p>To keep the clothes in the basket from freezing before they are hung up
    in winter, fill a metal hot-water bottle with very hot water and place this
    on top of the basket. As the clothes begin to freeze, push the bottle from
    place to place. This will warm the hands as well as stop the freezing.</p>
  <p>A small-sized rubber hot-water bottle carried in the clothes-pin bag will
    add greatly to the comfort of winter laundry work.</p>
  <h5><a name="colored" id="colored"></a>WASHING COLORED CLOTHES</h5>
  <p>94. <strong>Setting Colors</strong>.&#8212;There is considerable controversy on the subject
    of color setting. Some authorities claim that if color is not set by the
    manufacturers when fabrics are released from the factory, no amount of processing
    in the home can fix the dyes. Others, however, think that much can be done
    by the home woman to help fix as well as preserve the original color of her
    garments. Consequently, because of the uncertainty as to whether colors are
    or are not guaranteed &quot;fast,&quot; as are, for instance, Everfast fabrics
    and Indian Head, the careful housewife will give colored clothes particular
    attention in laundering.</p>
  <p>Following are recipes for solutions that prove very effective for some colors.
    In every case, after setting the color in garments and before washing them,
    dry the garments thoroughly. Also, take care to use lukewarm water instead
    of hot water and to use the minimum amount of soap chips or jelly, remembering
    that hot 
    water and much rubbing with soap will make colors &quot;bleed.&quot; Another
    point that it is well to know is that if the fabrics are plain colors, a
    color rinse may be used in the same way as bluing is used. Also, vinegar
    added to the rinse water brightens faded colors.</p>
  <p>95. For colored fabrics, especially for pink, brown, or black, a general
    recipe is to use <em>common salt solution</em>. For this, 1 cupful of salt to 1 gallon
    of water is a satisfactory proportion. The material should, if possible,
    be left to soak in this solution over night and then dried before washing.
    It is advisable to put the material through this process each time it is
    laundered, as the salt does not have a lasting effect.</p>
  <p>Despite the fact that a great many authorities approve of this recipe for
    setting colors, it is well to know that there are some who claim that it
    hinders the work of cleaning, since to put salt in the water makes it hard.
    They recommend washing with the water at a low temperature, about 98&deg; F.,
    using fine soaps or soap flakes, and not using any salt unless the color
    starts to bleed or gives evidence that it will.</p>
  <p>96. A <em>sugar-of-lead solution</em> is generally recommended for delicate colors,
    especially lavender, yellow, and light green, but it proves effective also
    for many darker colors, such as red.</p>
  <p>To make this color-setting solution, follow the proportion of 1 ounce of
    sugar of lead to 1 gallon of boiling water. Try to dissolve every particle
    of the sugar of lead, but should any insoluble substance remain, strain the
    solution in order to prevent the formation of streaks in the material, which
    may be impossible to remove. Wait until the solution is cold before placing
    the material in it; also, let the material remain there for 2 or 3 hours
    before rinsing it.</p>
  <p>Sugar of lead is poisonous if taken internally, so extreme care must be
    exercised in handling it.</p>
  <p>97. An <em>alum solution</em> is considered effective for green, blue, or mauve.
    To make it, follow the proportions of 1 tablespoonful of alum to 1 gallon
    of water.</p>
  <p>98. A <em>vinegar solution</em> usually proves satisfactory for pink, mauve, and
    blue. In making such a solution, follow the proportion of 1 cupful of vinegar
    to 1 gallon of water.</p>
  <p>99. <em>Alum</em> and <em>salt</em>, in the proportion of 1 cupful of salt and 1 tablespoonful
    of alum to each gallon of water, form a solution that is efficacious in the
    setting of brown, gray, and pink.</p>
  <p>100. <em>Alum, salt, vinegar</em>, and <em>sugar of lead</em> are used in combination for
    setting the color in plaids, checks, and figured goods. Use 1/2 cupful of
    vinegar, 1 cupful of salt, 1 tablespoonful of alum, and 1 tablespoonful of
    sugar of lead for each gallon of water.</p>
  <p>101. <em>Salt</em> and <em>vinegar</em> also make a practicable combination. Into 1 gallon
    of water, put 1 cupful of salt and 1/2 cupful of vinegar. Bring to a boil.
    Plunge the article into the boiling water and boil a few minutes. Do not
    wet the garment before putting it in. Colors set in this way should not run.</p>
  <p>102. <em>Ox gall</em>, 1 tablespoonful to each gallon of water, is used in setting
    red.</p>
  <p>103. <strong>General Directions for Washing Colored Clothes</strong>. 
    Colored clothes should not be soaked before washing. Use lukewarm water,
      even cold water for pale colors, and mild soap flakes or soap jelly, and
      avoid vigorous rubbing. It will be found that squeezing the clothes with
      the hands in the soapy water will remove the usual soil, except perhaps
      at the neck line or cuffs. Gentle rubbing may be employed at these places.</p>
  <p>If the garment appears clean after this treatment, the rinsing process should
    be begun. Do not twist the garment in the hands to remove water, but rather
    squeeze it. A wringer is not always practical either, because it may press
    the colors into each other. As much of the soapy water as possible should
    be pressed out before placing the article in the first rinse water, which
    should be of practically the same temperature as the first solution.</p>
  <p>The tub should be well filled so that the clear water may penetrate every
    part of the garment. At least three rinsings are required for colored clothes.
    The last water should be clear after the garment is removed from it.</p>
  <p>104. Of course, colored fabrics should never be boiled, no matter how soiled
    they are. In the case of heavy overalls, mechanics' suits, or in fact any
    garments soiled from the grease of machinery, or otherwise badly spotted,
    they should be washed first in 
    gasoline to release the dirt held by the oil, and then with soap chips and
    very hot water to cleanse them thoroughly.</p>
  <p>105. <strong>Starching Colored Clothes</strong>.&#8212;The starch for colored clothes should
    be no warmer than lukewarm, as hot starch may affect the color. If the starch
    is tinted according to the color of the fabric, it will tend to preserve
    the bright color in the material. Tea or coffee may be added for black or
    brown, bluing for blue, and red ink for pink or red, or tinting powders in
    colors to match the fabric may be used. These should be thoroughly dissolved
    so that the starch will have an even color.</p>
  <p>In using such solutions, be careful that the color is not too deep. If possible,
    test it first on a sample of the material.</p>
  <p>106. <strong>Drying Colored Clothes</strong>.&#8212;Never hang colored clothes in the sun;
    always hang them in the shade. If possible, select a windy day for washing
    printed fabrics that have a contrasting ground, for they will dry more quickly,
    and the less time given to the operation, the less chance there is that the
    colors will run into the background.</p>
  <p>It is not safe to wring a printed fabric once its colors have started to
    run. Rather, remove most of the moisture between Turkish towels, working
    quickly for the best results. Hang the garment out-of-doors in the shade
    and iron while still damp. Guard against freezing in cold weather, it being
    very injurious to colored fabrics.</p>
  <h5><a name="ironing" id="ironing"></a>IRONING</h5>
  <p>107<a name="107" id="107"></a>. <strong>Dampening</strong>.&#8212;The next step in the laundering process is to sprinkle
    the clothes to make them ready for ironing. Usually this is done on a table
    after the clothes have been brought in from the line. Some housewives find
    that spraying them with a garden hose while they are still on the line is
    a time-saving plan. However, this is possible only in favorable weather.</p>
  <p>It is important that clothes be dampened evenly and not made too wet. An
    excellent device for simplifying the sprinkling process and making it less
    irksome is a finely pierced aluminum or tin sprinkler, as mentioned in Art.
    <a href="ldc-03.html#49">49</a>. Some housewives prefer to use a clean whisk broom, which is kept for
    the purpose. Either of these methods is preferable to that of dipping the
    fingers in water.</p>
  <p>In sprinkling starched things, especially, one should avoid too much moisture,
    for when the garment is tightly rolled and allowed 
    to stand for several hours it usually becomes damp enough. Silk should never
    be sprinkled, but should be pressed dry or ironed while still wet. Sprinkling
    causes it to spot. Linens may be dampened more than cottons; in fact, they
    must be quite wet to give a glossy finish in ironing.</p>
  <p>108. After sprinkling, roll up each garment as tightly as possible, place
    all close together in the basket, and cover with a Turkish towel to keep
    the outer portions from drying out. In folding, lay all trimming, hems, collars,
    and cuffs inside, because they require more moisture than the rest of the
    garment, and, if left exposed, they are likely to dry quickly. Also, remember
    that time can be saved in the ironing process if care has been taken in the
    folding; for example, if sheets and table-cloths have been folded so that
    their edges meet and the folds are according to whatever method of folding
    you prefer, the ironing of them will be very simple.</p>
  <p>109. After dampening, allow white clothes to stand from 4 to 10 hours, usually
    over night. If in case of an emergency they must be ironed immediately, use
    hot water for dampening them. Or, if borax has been used as stiffening, iron
    the garments before they have dried on the line. Another point to remember
    is that if dampened clothes are left too long, they may dry out or, in warm
    weather, they may become mildewed.</p>
  <p>It is not advisable to dampen colored clothes any length of time before
    ironing, for their colors might run. The ideal way is to take them from the
    line before they are too dry and iron them at once. If this cannot be done,
    dampen them with warm water about 15 to 20 minutes before ironing.</p>
  <p>110. <strong>Cautions Concerning the Iron</strong>.&#8212;To iron easily, be sure to have
    the iron hot enough. Try it on a folded cloth or paper or touch it with a
    moistened finger. If you use the former method, the cloth or paper should
    not show scorch. If you use the latter method, the iron should sizzle if
    the temperature is right.</p>
  <p>It is always well to keep a piece of beeswax or paraffin to rub on the iron
    to prevent its sticking, but more stringent means may be necessary to keep
    the surface smooth. If so, one of the following should fit the circumstances:</p>
  <p>Saturate a cloth with water, wring it partly dry, and rub soap thoroughly
    on it. Place it on several thicknesses of paper and pass 
    the iron over it several times, pressing hard to remove starch and roughness.
    The result is surprising, as it makes the surface of the iron perfectly smooth
    and clean.</p>
  <p>If an iron becomes rusty or rough on its under surface, it may be cleaned
    and smoothed by sprinkling coarse salt on a board or tin and rubbing the
    hot iron over it repeatedly until the rust and the roughness have disappeared.
    Also, fine steel wool or fine sandpaper can be used with excellent results.
    To secure a more polished surface and to prevent starch from sticking, heat
    the iron, touch it to a block of paraffin, and rub it back and forth over
    clean paper, as in ironing, until its surface is smooth and polished.</p>
  <p>111. <strong>Ironing Flat Pieces</strong>.&#8212;Iron with the thread of the material and
    do not iron so quickly that the surface is not dried, as this will cause
    the material to blister afterwards.</p>
  <p>Iron cottons and linens on the right side except where there is embroidery
    work, beading, buttons, or other fasteners. Such a surface should be laid
    on a thick, soft towel or blanket so that the embroidery work or fasteners
    will be pressed down into the padded surface, and then ironed on the wrong
    side. This causes embroidery to stand out well and protects the fasteners.</p>
  <p>Linen table-cloths have the best finish when ironed on the right side, and,
    as in the case of all linens, should be very damp and ironed with a hot iron
    to get the best results.</p>
  <p>112. <strong>Ironing Garments</strong>.&#8212;The general rule is to iron first the parts
    of garments that will hang off the board when the rest is being ironed. For
    example, in ironing a man's shirt or a blouse, iron the collar and cuffs
    first, then the sleeves, then the back, and finally the front. The plan of
    ironing the fronts of such garments last helps to produce a better appearance
    in the finished work. Brush the garment with a damp cloth if it becomes dry
    while ironing.</p>
  <p>113. In ironing dresses, do the work as rapidly but as evenly as possible,
    following the straight, lengthwise threads of the material. The cuffs, sleeves,
    and trimming features should receive attention first; the waist, next; and
    the skirt, last. Use a moderately hot iron and firm pressure so that the
    material will be perfectly smooth and free from creases. Press the garment
    until it is quite dry, giving particular attention to the waist line and
    seams, for if there is any dampness at these places, the material will wrinkle
    again while drying.</p>
  <p>A well-dampened, clean cloth is very convenient for dampening spots that
    may become too dry. Also, it is a worth-while precaution to go over the entire
    garment the second time. As final pressing can be done more rapidly, it will
    add just the required finished look. Then too, after ironing, one may hold
    the garment up and look it over to be sure that there are no parts that require
    further attention.</p>
  <p>114. Further hints that will prove helpful in the ironing of  garments
    follow.</p>
  <p>Very fine gathers, as in organdies or any sheer cotton, will look like new
    if, after being ironed, they are stroked with a needle as in sewing.</p>
  <p>When ironing a garment trimmed with ruffles or a flounce, iron this feature
    first. If there are two or more ruffles close together or overlapping, iron
    the under one first. Hold the ruffles straight on the hem edge, and iron
    up into the gathers. Press the skirt with  the lengthwise thread of the
    material. Ironing crosswise makes the skirt sag and wrinkle at the seams.
    Tucks should be pulled taut and ironed lengthwise.</p>
  <p>Because silk is extremely sensitive to damp heat, the iron employed on moist
    silk things should be carefully tested. Some dry silks may be smoothed with
    a comparatively hot iron.</p>
  <p>Garments made from black sateen should be ironed on the wrong side, the
    same method as is used for silk being employed.</p>
  <p>Too hot an iron must not be used on colors that have a tendency to run,
    for the intense heat makes the colors bleed.</p>
  <p>115. <strong>Ironing Embroidery Pieces</strong>.&#8212;The majority of embroidery pieces
    should be ironed perfectly flat, as a flat, unbroken surface adds much to
    their beauty. They should be ironed with the thread of the material and slowly
    enough so that the entire surface is dried. Then they will not blister. Of
    course, the pieces should be quite wet and the designs should be ironed into
    an embroidery pad or Turkish towel.</p>
  <p>It is possible to pin, instead of iron, embroidery, and in many cases the
    results are better. The heavy embroidery dries under tension rather than
    pressure, and this allows it to cushion rather than flatten. To use this
    method, pin the embroidery piece directly on the ironing board or padded
    table, or put the pins in strips that you have previously sewed around the
    edges, using the same method    as is described in Art. <a href="#144">144</a> for curtains. If there is much background in
    a piece of embroidery that you are smoothing in this way, iron it as much
    as possible so as to give it the gloss that linen and many other fabrics
    require.</p>
  <p>116. If embroidery pieces are not to be used immediately after laundering,
    lay them perfectly flat in a drawer where they will not be in danger of becoming
    wrinkled. Pieces too large to be cared for in this way should be rolled carefully
    over a paper roll. So that the material will not become soiled, always wrap
    a piece of paper or muslin around the roll before putting it away. Some housewives
     are proud possessors of centerpiece rolls of linene, crash, or some similar
    material.</p>
  <p><a href="illust/hl-43-23.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',457,557);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/hl-43-23-t.jpg" alt="Figure 23" width="220" height="179" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>Fig. 23 features a simply made, but effective, centerpiece roll with napkin
    container to match. Tablecloth containers may be provided, too, these being
    oblong and larger, so as to hold a table-cloth as it is usually folded.</p>
  <p>Some persons prefer to repress all linens just previous to using them, as
    they think it makes the pieces appear fresher and more attractive. Especially
    do they press doilies and centerpieces that have been rolled.</p>
  <p class="clear">117. <strong>Removing Spots and Excess Gloss</strong>.&#8212;Ugly spots sometimes result
    in the following way: If too much starch is used on a garment and it is ironed
    when too damp, some of the starch sticks to the iron. Then, as the iron continues
    to heat, this starch is turned to dextrin, which is brown. If this is left
    on the iron and the iron is used when moderately hot, or on a garment that
    is quite damp, the dextrin rubs off on the garment, forming a spot that resembles
    both scorch and iron rust. Fortunately, it can be washed out. But the easiest
    method is to prevent it by examining the iron carefully and washing off the
    scorched starch, or dextrin, when the iron is only slightly warm.</p>
  <p><em>Scorch spots</em> may sometimes be washed out, but if they are not entirely removed
    by washing, put the garment in the sun to bleach. Other methods of removing
    scorch are given in Table I, under <em>Dry Cleaning</em>.</p>
  <p><em>If the garment is too glossy</em> after ironing, rub a damp cloth over it very
    quickly and iron again. This treatment may be repeated if the gloss still
    remains.</p>
  <p>118. <strong>Folding Clothes</strong>.&#8212;Much of the folding of clothes, particularly
    in the case of flat pieces, is done during the ironing process. If this step
    is treated as an important one, worthy of systematizing, it can save considerable
    time for the busy housewife. It is a matter of forming the habit of folding
    clothes the simplest way and with the creases in the best places. One general
    rule that can be applied to all articles is <em>to fold with the thread of
    the material</em>.</p>
  <p>119<a name="119" id="119"></a>. Nearly all housewives employ the same method of folding <em>plain sheets</em>.
    This method is the simple way of making a lengthwise fold through the middle,
    another lengthwise fold through the middle of the two layers, a crosswise
    fold through the center, and a final crosswise fold through the layers that
    have been obtained by the previous foldings.</p>

To fold a <em>monogrammed sheet</em> so as not to crease the monogram,
    first make a crosswise fold, as along the line marked <em>1</em>, Fig. 24
    (<em>a</em>). It is well,
    in making this fold, to have the under edge drawn back about 1/2 inch; otherwise,
    in making the second fold, the under edge 
    will be pushed out about that distance and cause the edges to be uneven.
    Now fold half-way between the first fold and the edges, as along the dotted
    line <em>2</em>, keeping the monogram on the outside. Then, after turning
    the folded sheet over so that the monogram is on the under side, make a vertical
    fold,
    as at <em>3</em> in (<em>b</em>), about one-fifth of the distance from side
    to side of the sheet. Make other folds along the dotted lines in the order
    shown by the
    numbers. The folded sheet will then appear as at (<em>c</em>) with the monogram in
    the center.</p>
  <p>121. For <em>pillow cases</em> and <em>towels</em>, the accepted method of folding is shown
    in Fig. 24 (<em>d</em>). Make the first fold as along the dotted line marked <em>1</em>, away
    from you, and the second fold along the line marked <em>2</em>. Then, make a crosswise
    fold at <em>3</em> and turn this also away from you, when the process will be completed
    and the monogram will be on the outside.</p>
  <p>122. The approved method of folding <em>napkins</em> is illustrated in Fig. 24 (<em>e</em>).
    Be careful to follow the various steps in the order indicated, always keeping
    the monogram on the outside.</p>
  <p>123. The folding of <em>table-cloths</em> varies considerably, depending on the size
    and shape of the linen and the position of monograms. But an important point
    to remember in whatever method is followed is that too much creasing destroys
    the beauty of a table-cloth.</p>
  <p>The most common method of folding a table-cloth is the method described
    in Art. <a href="#119">119</a> for folding a plain sheet, but there are ways of folding so as
    to lessen the number of creases.</p>
  <p>124. In Figs. 25 and 26 are shown two methods of folding so that there are
    only three lengthwise creases. If the table-cloth 
    cannot be put away conveniently in either shape, a soft, impressed crosswise
    fold may be made.</p>
  <p class="clear"><a href="illust/hl-45-25.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',379,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/hl-45-25-t.jpg" alt="Figure 25" width="220" height="99" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>In detail, the method of folding in Fig. 25 is as follows: First, fold the
    cloth in half lengthwise, as along the line marked <em>1</em> in (<em>a</em>). Next, divide
    the upper of the two resulting sections in half along the line marked<em> 2</em> in
    (<em>b</em>), folding one of these halves back on the other. Then turn the cloth over
    and divide the lower section in the same way along the line marked <em>3</em> in (<em>c</em>),
    folding one portion back on the other in the direction opposite from that
    of the fold at <em>2</em>. This method makes the two outside lengthwise creases alike.</p>
  <p class="clear"><a href="illust/hl-46-26.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',484,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/hl-46-26-t.jpg" alt="Figure 26" width="220" height="128" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>The method shown in Fig. 26 in detail is this: Divide the tablecloth in
    half lengthwise and crease. Then open out and bring one selvage, or lengthwise
    edge, of the cloth over to this crease, folding 
    along the line <em>1</em> in (<em>a</em>). Fold the remaining half along the line at <em>2</em>, bringing
    the other selvage, or lengthwise edge, to the creased center line. As a last
    step, fold along the center line, as at<em> 3</em> in (<em>b</em>), bringing the folded sections
    together in the position shown. This method makes all three lengthwise creases
    alike.</p>
  <p class="clear"><a href="illust/hl-48-27.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,373);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/hl-48-27-t.jpg" alt="Figure 27" width="118" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>125. In <em>ironing undergarments</em>, avoid all unnecessary creases and yet fold
    the garments so that they may be placed conveniently in a drawer. Fig. 27
    indicates the manner of folding the ordinary articles of woman's underwear.</p>
  <p>To fold the <em>nightgown</em> shown at the upper left of the illustration, with
    the front next to the board, first make a lengthwise fold from shoulder to
    hem, as along the dotted line <em>1</em> in (<em>a</em>), turning the fold toward the back
    of the garment. Next, fold back an equal portion of the garment on the opposite
    side, as along the line marked<em> 2</em>. 
    Then turn upward, toward the back of the garment, the lower third of the
    gown, as along the line at <em>3</em>. As a last step, fold the upper third of the
    gown back so that it covers the lower third, which, as 
    just explained, has been turned upward. If these directions are followed,
    the upper front section of the nightgown will be exposed. Put away with this
    side uppermost.</p>
  <p>126. To fold a <em>chemise, combination</em>, or <em>slip</em>, follow the method explained
    for folding a nightgown. The process is indicated in detail by the dotted
    lines and figures in (<em>b</em>), Fig. 27.</p>
  <p>127. The method of folding a pair of <em>drawers</em> or <em>pajama drawers</em> is illustrated
    in (<em>c</em>), Fig. 27. In this view, the drawers are shown with the legs together.
    Place them in this position on the board, and make a lengthwise fold along
    the dotted line <em>1</em>. Next, make a crosswise fold along the dotted line <em>2</em>, just
    midway between the upper and lower edges of the drawers. Be sure, in making
    this fold, to turn it in such direction that the section, which has already
    been 
    folded over, will be covered. Pajama drawers need another crosswise fold.</p>
  <p>Fold <em>step-ins</em> and <em>bloomers</em> once lengthwise and once crosswise. Often these
    are of such soft silks that it is not practical to try to fold them precisely.</p>
  <p>128. To fold an <em>underskirt</em>, first place it in the position shown
    at (<em>d</em>),
    Fig. 27. Now make a lengthwise fold, from waist line to hem, along the dotted
    line <em>1</em>. Next, make a similar fold on the opposite side of the garment
    along the line <em>2</em>, turning this fold in the same direction as the
    first one. As a third and final step, make a crosswise fold along the dotted
    line <em>3</em>, midway
    between the waist line 
    and hem. Turn this fold in the direction of the other two, leaving the section
    between the dotted lines <em>1, 2</em>, and <em>3</em> exposed. Put away this section on top.</p>
  <p class="clear"><a href="illust/hl-48-28.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',577,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/hl-48-28-t.jpg" alt="Figure 28" width="220" height="153" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>129. The simplest way of folding a <em>man's nightshirt</em> is shown in Fig. 28.
    Lay the nightshirt lengthwise on the board, and make two lengthwise folds
    as at <em>1</em> and <em>2</em>, view (<em>a</em>). Then fold the sleeves back 
    as at <em>3</em> and <em>4</em>, view (<em>b</em>). The next two turns, <em>5</em> and <em>6</em>, will bring the nightshirt
    into the position shown in (<em>c</em>), and folding the sleeves over to the front
    will result in the form shown in (<em>d</em>).</p>
  <p class="clear"><a href="illust/hl-49-29.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,487);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/hl-49-29-t.jpg" alt="Figure 29" width="156" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>130. The process of folding a <em>man's shirt</em> is shown in Fig. 29. The difference
    between this method and the one employed in folding a nightshirt lies principally
    in the folding of the sleeves. The first fold is a lengthwise one, as at
    <em>1</em>, view (<em>b</em>), the second turn places one of the sleeves as at <em>2</em>; the third
    is another lengthwise one, as at <em>3</em>; 
    and the fourth one places the other sleeve as at <em>4</em>, view (<em>c</em>). Two more folds,
    as at <em>5</em> and <em>6</em>, result in the folded shirt shown in view (<em>d</em>).  
    This same process applies to pajama coats.</p>
  <p>131. <em>Smoothing and folding, without ironing</em>, certain articles,
    such as bath towels, wash cloths, and cr&ecirc;pe garments, is practiced by many
    housewives,
    by some because of the time saved, and by others because they prefer the
    freshness of unironed garments.</p>
  <p class="clear">132. <strong>Airing Clothes and Sorting Them</strong>.&#8212;Directly after ironing and before
    putting bed linens and garments away in drawers, do not fail to air them
    thoroughly. This is necessary so that no dampness will remain and there will
    be no likelihood of the clothes mildewing or becoming musty. A rack near
    the ironing board is a handy place to air clothes; then if the rack can be
    stood where there will be a free circulation of fresh air, the clothes can
    regain much of the freshness which the hot iron destroys.</p>
  <p>While you are finishing the various pieces, you can save the length of time
    of an extra sorting by placing all similar articles together on the rack
    or on a table.</p>
  <h5><a name="fine" id="fine"></a>FINE LAUNDERING</h5>
  <p>133. Although the general principles of laundering are the same for practically
    all cotton or linen fabrics, there are always a few exceptions, and some
    articles must be handled in a slightly different way to be satisfactorily
    finished. Consequently, it is a good plan to make a collection of fine clothes
    and give a special time to their laundering. These include lingerie dresses,
    babies' finery, delicate laces, and embroidered pieces.</p>
  <p>Although silk underwear and hosiery fall under the division of fine laundering,
    it is best not to make a collection of these for washing at some convenient,
    but postponed, date. Such articles, because of their contact with the body,
    will serve longer periods of usefulness if washed when they are removed.
    Also, if done at once, they can be washed more easily and with less friction
    on the delicate fibers. Dealers in such goods always recommend that it is
    a saving to wash silk stockings and underwear when they are taken off at
    night. And this need not sound too great an undertaking to even the busiest
    and most tired person, for the soap flakes on the market now have taken much
    of the tedium out of washing.</p>
  <p>134. <strong>Washing Fine Articles</strong>.&#8212;The first consideration is to wash fine
    garments in clean, soft, warm, not hot, water, and with mild soap. Make a
    good lather, and then gently squeeze the fabric through the solution. Do
    not rub, for rubbing will injure fine fabrics and roughen embroidery stitches.
    If any part of a stamped embroidery design is visible, it should be removed
    before washing by wiping it carefully with a soft cloth that has been saturated
    with gasoline or turpentine, so that there will be no possibility of any
    stamped lines remaining after the article is laundered.</p>
  <p>135. <strong>Drying Fine Articles</strong>.&#8212;Do not put extremely delicate things through
    the wringer; instead, squeeze the water out and thus avoid the danger of
    strain. To remove the water from frail fabrics, a good plan is to roll them
    in a Turkish towel. Spread the towel out first and lay the pieces on top
    of it; then roll up the towel, pressing on it as the rolling is done. The
    towel will absorb a great deal of the water, and put the pieces in a condition
    for easy ironing.</p>
  <p>Never let fancy-work pieces that are not starched get thoroughly dry. Have
    them as free from water as possible and iron while still damp.</p>
  <p>136. <strong>Stiffening Fine Articles</strong>.&#8212;Some delicate fabrics may not require
    a dressing, but if one is necessary, one of several agents may be used, depending
    on the type of material and its color. Most organdie of the better quality
    has what is known as a permanent finish; that is, a crispness not affected
    by soap and water. This sort of fabric does not, of course, require any further
    treatment, but if the organdie feels soft to the hands when wet, some stiffening
    is necessary.</p>
  <p>When the color is rather dark, gum-arabic solution is best for it, the proportions
    given in Art. <a href="#87">87</a> being satisfactory.</p>
  <p>If the garment is light in color, use the borax solution given in Art. <a href="#86">86</a>,
    remembering, too, that a garment treated in this way should be ironed while
    damp.</p>
  <p>Gum arabic is as satisfactory for voile, dotted Swiss, and similar materials
    as it is for organdie. After the excess moisture has been squeezed out, the
    garment should be hung up until dry. It should then be dampened, rolled in
    a Turkish towel until the moisture is evenly distributed, and ironed.</p>
  <p>Starch, the usual stiffening agent, is not especially satisfactory for sheer
    materials, because of its tendency to thicken on the threads and take away
    from the transparency of the fabric.</p>
  <p>137. <strong>Laundering Garments Having Ribbon</strong>.&#8212;Garments in which ribbon is
    used should have the ribbon removed before laundering. To remove ribbon so
    that it may be replaced quickly, tack a length of narrow tape at the end
    of the ribbon, lapping one over the other, and then draw the ribbon out of
    the beading so as to leave the tape in its place. The ribbon may be replaced
    after laundering by simply reversing this operation.</p>
  <p>    138. <strong>Laundering Embroidery Work with Colored Thread</strong>.&#8212;If
    embroidery work is done with colored thread, wash the piece in lukewarm
    suds as quickly as possible, rinse it a couple of times in clear water, and
    iron it at once. Do not roll it up nor let it stand, for the colors might
    run.</p>
  <h5><a name="laces" id="laces"></a>LAUNDERING LACES</h5>
  <p>139<a name="139" id="139"></a>. <strong>Wet Cleaning Laces</strong>.&#8212;There are many methods of cleaning lace,
    but in all of them the main point to be observed is to 
    refrain from rubbing the lace, as rubbing is liable to tear the threads.</p>
  <p>A very good method consists in preparing lukewarm suds, allowing the lace
    to soak for some time, and then washing carefully by squeezing the suds through
    it. Rinse thoroughly and blue or tint, if desired.</p>
  <p><a href="illust/hl-52-30.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,724);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/hl-52-30-t.jpg" alt="Figure 30" width="220" height="188" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>For stiffening, use gum-arabic dressing, and, after rinsing thoroughly,
    pin the lace on a pad made by fastening towels on an ironing board or similar
    surface. Shape the design of the lace well, as shown in Fig. 30, and draw
    the points out and pin in place so that they may dry in position.</p>
  <p>140<a name="140" id="140"></a>. Another method consists in winding the lace around a piece of unvarnished
    broom handle or a glass bottle, and letting it soak overnight in warm soap-suds.
    Rinse it well in warm water, soak it over night in soap-suds again, and rinse
    it thoroughly without rubbing.</p>
  <p>Also, a clean, self-sealing fruit jar may be used for washing lace. Fill
    the jar half full of warm, soft water, and put in 1 tablespoonful of soap
    jelly, soap flakes, or white soap shaved fine. Place the lace in the jar
    and fasten the top securely. Shake well until the lace is thoroughly washed;
    then lift it carefully from the jar, clean the jar, and fill it half full
    of warm rinse water. Put the lace back in the jar and rinse it by shaking,
    just as when washing the lace. Take out the lace and pin it on a dry cloth
    or lay it 
    between pieces of white blotting paper to dry.</p>
  <p>141<a name="141" id="141"></a>. When washing Battenburg or similar laces, a good method is to baste
    the lace carefully to a piece of white cotton material with the right side
    next to the cotton, use one of the washing processes, and then iron before
    removing the bastings.</p>
  <p>Still another method of washing fine lace is to permit the lace to lie in
    borax water for 24 hours, and then squeeze it through several rinse waters
    without rubbing. Use 1 tablespoonful of borax to a quart of water in making
    the borax solution. After the lace has been rinsed, steam it and pull or
    pin it into shape. Do not iron it if the lace is of a very delicate variety,
    as the weight of the iron presses down the threads and makes them shiny and
    glossy.</p>
  <p>142. It is not advisable to wash <em>black laces</em> with soap and water, but they
    may be freshened by 
    dipping them into 3 parts lukewarm water and 1 part vinegar. They may be
    very thoroughly rubbed with the hands in this solution and then stretched
    on a pad, as are other laces, for drying.</p>
  <p class="clear"><a href="illust/hl-53.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,162);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/hl-53-t.jpg" alt="Scarf with fringe" width="47" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>143. <strong>Washing Fringe</strong>.&#8212;To wash fringe, either silk or cotton, proceed
    in the manner recommended in Art. <a href="#139">139</a> for washing lace, omitting, of course,
    the stiffening. Shake the fringe after washing and stretch the woven edge
    and tack it on a padded board to dry. 
    While it is still wet, comb it with a scrupulously clean hair comb and weight
    the bottom edge.</p>
  <p>Since fringe curls in washing, dry cleaning is the preferred process. Rolling
    the fringe around a bottle or piece of cardboard will help considerably to
    prevent curling, and should always be done while the fringe is still damp.</p>
  <p>144<a name="144" id="144"></a>. <strong>Laundering Lace Curtains</strong>.&#8212;To launder lace curtains presents the
    difficulty of removing soil without injuring the delicate fibers of the lace
    and without stretching the curtains out of shape.</p>
  <p>An excellent way to make sure that curtains will be the same length after
    washing as they were before is to measure them before they are tubbed, and
    if curtain stretchers are to be used adjust the curtain stretchers to the
    right size. Then, after washing, you can fasten the curtains on the frame
    and be sure that your curtains will fit the windows. If you dry the curtains
    on a sheet on the floor or on a mattress, you can dry them to measurements
    as well as if they were on curtain stretchers.</p>
  <p>145. The first step in the process of cleaning is to brush or shake the
    curtains carefully to remove as much dust as possible. Next, soak the curtains
    overnight in a tub of cold water to loosen more dirt and to make rubbing
    unnecessary. In the morning, put the curtains into lukewarm water in which
    soap flakes or soap jelly and a little borax have been dissolved, using enough
    to make good, &quot;live&quot; suds. Instead of rubbing, sop the curtains
    up and down and squeeze the water out of them, forcing the dirt out with
    the water. Then keep sopping and squeezing them in clear water of the same
    temperature, giving them enough rinsings to free them from all trace of soap
    or dirt.</p>
  <p>At this stage, one of two methods may be chosen for completing the laundering
    of curtains. One method is to spread curtains on the grass or hang them on
    the line to dry, and then, when dry to stiffen them, using if possible a
    gum-arabic stiffening, as this will make an even solution that will not fill
    the meshes of the lace. This method bleaches the curtains.</p>
  <p>The other method is quicker and is the one in use in the majority of households.
    The stiffening is done immediately after the rinsing and before the curtains
    are dried.</p>
  <p>Starch may be used instead of gum arabic, if it is made thin enough so that
    it will not fill the meshes of the net.</p>
  <p class="clear"><a href="illust/hl-55.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,422);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/hl-55-t.jpg" alt="Lady hanging curtains" width="134" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>146. <em>Loosely woven curtains</em>, such as lace and net, should be dried on stretchers.
    To use curtain stretchers successfully, certain precautions must be taken.
    Because the strain placed on the edges of the curtains is unequal to that
    which the rest of the curtain receives, they are likely to stretch into ugly
    scallops and to have large pin-holes in them.</p>
  <p>To equalize the strain and prevent the formation of scallops, use light-weight
    unbleached muslin torn lengthwise into 4 1/2-inch strips. Fold these strips
    double and overcast the raw edges together. Baste the edges of the lace curtains
    firmly over these raw edges, lapping them over about 1/2 inch. Use four separate
    strips for each curtain, letting them cross at the corners and extend 6 or
    8 inches beyond. Then attach the firm, folded edge of the muslin to the stretcher,
    thus eliminating unattractive scallops on the curtain. 
    Of course, the additional width of the muslin strips must be taken into consideration
    in adjusting the size of the stretcher.</p>
  <p>147. <em>Firmly woven curtains</em> may be ironed, but great care must be exercised
    in ironing to keep the curtains straight. It is advisable to have the curtains
    pulled straight and true 
    just before placing them on the ironing board.</p>
  <p>To pull the curtain straight, gather the hem of one end into the hand, having
    the edge even, and have another person do the same with the other end; then
    pull gently to straighten the threads. If necessary, one may do this alone
    by pinning one end of the curtain to the ironing board and pulling from the
    other end.</p>
  <p>Ironing a curtain with its selvage edges together also will help to keep
    it straight. 
    The lengthwise crease need not be ironed in. The curtain may be ironed on
    both sides, except near the crease, and then opened out for the ironing of
    the remainder. A satisfactory method for ruffle curtains is to dry them on
    a stretcher and then iron the ruffle.</p>
  <p>148. <strong>Tinting Curtains</strong>.&#8212;It is possible to restore
    curtains to their original color or to make them any desired color. For this
    purpose, commercial
    tinting powders may be purchased in any color. Also, such agents as cr&ecirc;pe
    paper, red ink, tea, coffee, and ocher may be pressed into service. Directions
    for using cr&ecirc;pe paper and red ink are given later in Art. <a href="#178">178</a> to Art. <a href="#180">180</a>,
    inclusive.</p>
  <p><em>To obtain a cream color</em>, use tea and coffee mixed together in equal proportions.
    This gives the desirable &quot;store tint&quot; and is more satisfactory
    then either one used alone.</p>
  <p><em>To obtain an ecru color</em>, use a mixture of very strong tea and coffee together,
    or powdered ocher. The amount necessary depends on the number of curtains,
    and can be judged by trial. Tint the curtains the right tone or perhaps a
    trifle darker to allow for the color that will be taken out during the starching.</p>
  <p>It is wise to tint the starch also. If you choose ocher as the coloring
    agent, you will usually find 1/2 teaspoonful of ocher for each quart of starch
    a good proportion. Blend the ocher with cold water first and then stir it
    thoroughly into the starch to avoid any possibility of causing streaks. Always
    try the mixture on a small piece of lace to be sure of the desired color.
    If you choose tea or tea and coffee, have it cold and blend it with the starch
    as described for the use of ocher, and test the strength of the colored starch
    by trial.</p>
  <h5><a name="silk" id="silk"></a>LAUNDERING SPECIAL SILK ARTICLES</h5>
  <p>149. <strong>Washing Silks</strong>.&#8212;Because silk is made of animal fibers, which are
    dangerously affected by heat and rubbing, garments made from silk require
    particular handling, otherwise they will harden, become yellow, or shrink.</p>
  <p>In general, the following facts need to be known: </p>
  <ul>
    <li> Hot water, ammonia, and strong soap yellow silk. </li>
    <li> Rubbing injures the delicate fibers. </li>
    <li> Too hot an iron yellows, stiffens, and cracks silk.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>150<a name="150" id="150"></a>. To wash the fabric, put sufficient warm&#8212;not hot&#8212;water into
    a pan or tub of proper size to accommodate it and add sufficient soap jelly
    or soap flakes to make a lather. Using a little borax that has been diluted
    in hot water will help to make live suds. Immerse the garments and cleanse
    by squeezing the suds through them, not by rubbing.</p>
  <p>Always rinse thoroughly in at least three lukewarm waters, for unless all
    traces of soap are removed, the fibers will be injured and the fabric will
    also be more difficult to iron. To make sure of neutralizing the effect of
    the soap, add a little borax to your second rinse water. If bluing is desired,
    have the water lukewarm and use very little bluing, applying the same suggestions
    as given previously for bluing cotton fabrics.</p>
  <p>Squeeze silk fabrics or put them through the wringer, first loosening the
    rollers. Never twist, as this injures the threads.</p>
  <p>151<a name="151" id="151"></a>. <em>White or light silks</em> should be washed in water barely warm, so that
    there will be no heat to yellow and weaken the fibers. Ammonia should never
    be used, but a little borax may be added to the wash water, as it not only
    softens the water but acts as a mild bleach. White washable-silk fabrics
    may be dipped in blue if the usual precautions for bluing are taken. To dry,
    they should be rolled in a towel rather than hung on the line.</p>
  <p><em>Colored silks</em> that are fast in color may be treated in the same way as light
    silks. If the colors in a garment are likely to run, quick handling is essential;
    therefore, roll in Turkish towels, leave for a minute or two and repeat the
    process with two fresh towels, and, if necessary, two more until the garment
    is dry enough to iron.</p>
  <p>152. <strong>Color Setting in Silk</strong>.&#8212;To set the color in silk
    before washing, lay it for a short time in water containing vinegar and salt
    in the proportion
    of 1 tablespoonful of vinegar and 1 teaspoonful of salt to 1 quart of water,
    using enough liquid to cover the material.</p>
  <p>153. <strong>Washing Georgette and Other Cr&ecirc;pes</strong>.&#8212;Since cr&ecirc;pe fabrics
    shrink when wet, such materials should not be allowed to dry thoroughly,
    but should
    be rolled in a towel and then gently stretched out to the proper shape while
    ironing. Of course, care must be taken to have the wash water and the rinsing
    baths all of the same temperature, and that a low one, so as to minimize
    shrinkage.</p>
  <p>154. <strong>Brightening Colors in Silks</strong>.&#8212;If the bright tints
    of the silk appear to have faded in the wash, 1 tablespoonful of vinegar
    to 1 quart of
    water used as the last rinse water will help to revive the color; but if
    the color has disappeared in spots, then 1 tablespoonful of ammonia added
    to each quart of water will prove a better agent, provided, of course, the
    color is such that it will not be affected by the yellowing properties of
    ammonia.</p>
  <p>155. <strong>Stiffening Silks</strong>.&#8212;It may be necessary to apply a dressing to
    some silks after washing. Good-quality taffeta will not require stiffening,
    and some other silks will prove to have sufficient dressing if they are ironed
    while damp. However, when a dressing is needed for silk, <em>sugar and water</em>    will be found very satisfactory. Use 1 to 2 tablespoonfuls of sugar to each
    gallon of warm water. <em>Gum-arabic dressing</em>, Art. <a href="#87">87</a>, also, is excellent for
    soft silks.</p>
  <p>156. <strong>Ironing Silk</strong>.&#8212;All silk should be ironed while damp or when thoroughly
    dry, for if it must be sprinkled, the sprinkling will spot it. Pongee is
    an example of a silk weave which looks better if ironed while dry. If it
    is necessary to dampen the silk while ironing, lay a damp cloth on it and
    press over the cloth. Dampening the cloth in the center only and leaving
    the edges dry prevents the making of marks where the wet cloth touches the
    part freshly ironed.</p>
  <p>For the best results, have the iron only moderately hot, and do the ironing
    on the wrong side, or with a damp cloth over the right side of the material.
    To avoid the hard, shiny effect that often results from ironing silk, have
    the ironing board covered with smooth wool of the cashmere variety, not the
    fluffy kind. Old wool is 
    usually better for this purpose than new wool.</p>
  <p>Do not iron white silks before putting them  away for the winter, for then
    they will become yellow more readily.</p>
  <p>Some silks, especially of the cr&ecirc;pe and jersey weaves, both shrink and stretch.
    Consequently, to make sure that a garment is the correct length and size
    after laundering, it is wise to measure it and iron according to measurements,
    as in the case of curtains. This precaution should be taken especially in
    the case of costume slips, for it is very important that they be the right
    length.</p>
  <p class="clear"><a href="illust/hl-58.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',574,311);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/hl-58-t.jpg" alt="Stockings hanging to try on rack" width="105" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>157. <strong>Washing Silk Hosiery</strong>.&#8212;Wash silk stockings each time after they
    are worn, for perspiration affects silk hose almost as seriously as does
    strain.</p>
  <p>To wash, prepare light suds in hot water and dissolve the soap thoroughly.
    Add cold water until lukewarm and then dip the stockings and press the suds
    through them. Rinse in two lukewarm waters, and then squeeze them gently,
    but do not wring.</p>
  <p>When washing colored hoisery, do the work rapidly, using water that is almost
    cold. Also, use fresh suds for each different color.</p>
  <p>Dry stockings in the shade or indoors, but never on or over a radiator.
    If the stockings are embroidered in colors, hang them up with a cloth inside
    to keep the colors from running.</p>
  <p>It is advisable not to iron silk stockings. Pull them into shape while damp.</p>
  <p>158. <strong>Silk Underwear</strong>.&#8212;Directions for washing silk underwear often accompany
    the underwear when it is purchased. At least this is true in the case of
    good-quality underwear, and that is the only safe kind to buy, for the cheaper
    grades shrink and break under strain. Of course, the accompanying directions
    should be noted, but in general they will be found to be the same as those
    given in Arts. <a href="#150">150</a> and <a href="#151">151</a>.</p>
  <p>At times it is necessary to rub garments. This can be done with safety if
    only light, gentle rubbing is employed simultaneously with the squeezing,
    so that the garment is not rubbed dry.</p>
  <p>As hot sun and hot irons are as injurious as hot water, partly dry the underwear
    in a towel and finish with a warm iron.</p>
  <p class="clear"><a href="illust/hl-59.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',312,220);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/hl-59-t.jpg" alt="Pair of gloves" width="137" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>159. <strong>Silk Gloves</strong>.&#8212;The same general methods as are given for silk hosiery
    and silk underwear apply to the washing of silk gloves. Having them on the
    hands makes it easier to find all of the soiled spots and also facilitates
    any necessary rubbing, which should be done very gently.</p>
  <h5 class="clear"><a name="synthetic" id="synthetic"></a>LAUNDERING GARMENTS OF SYNTHETIC FIBERS</h5>
  <p>160. Garments of synthetic fibers, rayon, Celanese, and Bemberg, require
    handling similar to that given silk, but even greater care is necessary,
    particularly when the article is wet, because these fibers lose some of their
    tensile strength when wet. While this does not affect their wearing qualities,
    it is essential that any treatment, such as twisting or harsh squeezing that
    would crush the threads unduly, should be avoided, as should also too hot
    water. After washing and rinsing, remove the moisture in preparation for
    ironing, as directed for silks. Practically all fabrics made of synthetic
    fibers are fast color, so there is no need to take the usual precautions
    against fading.</p>
  <p>Many undergarments of the knitted type are made of synthetic 
    yarns. Launder these in the same manner, drying them indoors over  a line
      or clothes bar, because pressure of clothes pins causes injury to the fibers.
      Many of these undergarments do not require ironing, although they may be
      pressed with a moderately warm iron.</p>
  <h5><a name="woolen" id="woolen"></a>LAUNDERING SPECIAL WOOLEN ARTICLES</h5>
  <p>161. <strong>General Directions</strong>.&#8212;Because wool, as well as
    silk, is spun from animal fibers, it demands as much care in its treatment
    as silk. Keeping
    in mind the following facts about washing wool will help in lengthening the
    life of woolen articles and in keeping them soft and in shape until the end.</p>
  <p>Use soaps in solution to eliminate rubbing.</p>
  <p>Use mild soaps.</p>
  <p>Have all baths the same temperature to minimize shrinkage.</p>
  <p>The use of ammonia water in the proportion of 1 teaspoonful of 
    ammonia to each gallon of water in the final rinsing will help 
    to restore the new appearance of the material.  
    Rubbing will knot the fibers and harden the wool.  
    Woolens may be hung out to dry, but they are easier to handle if 
    ironed while still damp.  
    When hanging woolens to dry, avoid a very warm place, as heat 
    will cause shrinkage.  
    In ironing wools, have the irons only moderately hot and iron  
    such materials on the wrong side if possible. If you iron them 
    on the right side, place a damp cloth over the material.  
    A wringer may be used to remove excess water from woolen 
    articles, if care is taken to place the articles in the rollers so 
    that they will not lose their shape.</p>
  <p>162. <strong>Setting Color in Woolens</strong>.&#8212;To set the color in
    woolens, soak the materials for 2 hours in a vinegar solution made in the
    proportion of 1/2
    cupful of vinegar to 1 gallon of water.</p>
  <p>163. <strong>Drying Woolens</strong>.&#8212;Dry woolens in an even temperature; that of the
    ordinary room is best, as heat increases shrinkage. Do not hang woolens out-of-doors
    in cold weather or on sunny or windy days, as the extreme in temperature
    will cause shrinkage and the wind will destroy the shape of garments.</p>
  <p><em>Children's shirts and stockings</em> should be dried on wooden frames.    </p>
  <p><em>Flannel underwear</em> may be dried flat and stretched to shape.</p>
  <p>164. <strong>Pressing Woolens</strong>.&#8212;Woolens should be pressed with a warm iron,
    never a hot one, as wool scorches very easily. Lightweight woolens may be
    ironed when absolutely dry by placing a piece of damp cheesecloth over the
    material and using a warm iron. Otherwise, iron all woolens on the wrong
    side.</p>
  <p class="clear"><a href="illust/hl-63-31.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',348,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/hl-63-31-t.jpg" alt="Figure 31" width="220" height="90" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>165. <strong>Laundering Sweaters</strong>.&#8212;Keep knitted and crocheted wear under water
    while washing and do not pull or twist it in the process. Lift such things
    carefully and squeeze out the water gently. If 
    the garment is measured before being washed, it may be drawn out carefully
    and smoothed into its original size while wet, as shown in Fig. 31. Dry it
    on heavy towels spread on a table or on a flat, padded surface.</p>
  <p>166. <strong>Laundering Wool Blankets</strong>.&#8212;There is no reason why wool blankets,
    unless worn very thin, should not be so soft and fluffy after laundering
    as before. Put each blanket through two soapy waters, having the water lukewarm
    and using a mild soap or soap flakes. Rub the soiled edges thoroughly but
    lightly and rinse in several lukewarm waters. In the last rinsing water,
    dissolve enough soap flakes to make the water look milky. This helps to keep
    the wool fibers soft.</p>
  <p>Another means of keeping wool blankets from becoming stiff and harsh is
    to add a little glycerine to the last rinse water. This replaces the natural
    oils that are removed by the washing.</p>
  <p>Next, put the blanket through the wringer, having the rollers loosened,
    and then shake it well and hang it on the line, being careful to have half
    of the blanket on each side of the line and to have it very straight. When
    dry, press the edges lightly, if necessary, and then brush with a soft brush
    to raise the nap.</p>
  <p>167. <strong>Washing a Blanket Bath-Robe</strong>.&#8212;Wash a blanket bathrobe with soap
    and water, rinse thoroughly, but do not wring. Place on a coat hanger, hang
    on the clothes-line, and let it drip; then when partly dry, stretch it into
    shape. Very little pressing will be required. When thoroughly dry, brush
    with a stiff brush or a whisk broom to raise the nap.</p>
  <h5><a name="bleaching" id="bleaching"></a>BLEACHING</h5>
  <p>168. <strong>Bleaching Cotton and Linen</strong>.&#8212;White cotton or linen fabrics may
    be bleached if they have become yellow from age or gray from improper laundering.
    It is possible also to remove color from some materials to make them white
    or to prepare them for redyeing.</p>
  <p>169. <strong>Bleaching Agents for Cotton and Linen</strong>.&#8212;If clothes require bleaching,
    <em>expose them to the sun</em>, preferably laying them on the grass. Rain also is
    a bleaching agent, so if a shower or a soft rain comes up while clothes are
    laid out to bleach, the housewife is truly fortunate.</p>
  <p>In cold weather, clothes may be hung on the line. It will not injure them
    to freeze; in fact, freezing is considered a very efficacious bleach. The
    caution necessary is that one should not allow the garments to freeze to
    the line, for they might be torn in removing. Also, allowing frozen clothes
    to flap in the wind may result in tears. Letting clothes lie on the snow
    is still another effective bleach.</p>
  <p>170<a name="170" id="170"></a>. If sun bleaching does not bring about the desired results, or if it
    is not possible to hang garments out-of-doors, they may be whitened by soaking
    them for a few hours in <em>borax water</em>, made by using 3 cupful of borax to 1
    gallon of water.</p>
  <p>171. <em>Javelle water</em> is the most powerful agent for bleaching white cotton
    goods requiring special treatment. It may also be used for linen, if diluted,
    but is too strong for silk and wool, and in any case should be used with
    great care.</p>
  <p>A recipe for Javelle water is as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> 1 pound of washing soda </li>
    <li>1/2 pound of chloride of lime</li>
    <li> 1 quart of boiling water </li>
    <li>2 quarts of cold water</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Put the soda in an agate or earthenware dish and add the boiling water.
    Dissolve the lime in the cold water, let the mixture settle, then pour the
    clear lime liquid into the dissolved soda. Strain this, then bottle, and
    keep in a dark place.</p>
  <p>172. As a bleach for cotton, use 1 pint of Javelle water to 
    1 gallon of hot water. Dip the article to be bleached and allow it to remain
      in the bleach 2 or 3 minutes. If the material is very yellow, put it in
      and bring it to the boiling point, but do not allow it to boil. Next, remove
      the garment and rinse several times in ammonia water so that no Javelle
      water will remain to injure the fiber. About 3 tablespoonfuls of &quot;household&quot; ammonia
      to each gallon of water makes a satisfactory solution.</p>
  <p>For bleaching linen, use 1/2 to 3/4 pint of Javelle water to each gallon
    of water and proceed as for bleaching cotton.</p>
  <p>173. <strong>Bleaching Woolens</strong>.&#8212;Generally, the bleaching of woolens is not
    satisfactory and involves considerable time. <em>Potassium permanganate</em> may be
    used, however, if a bleaching agent is desired. First wash the article carefully
    and then prepare a quantity of potassium permanganate solution by dissolving
    1 teaspoonful of the crystals in a pint of warm water. Allow this to cool
    before using.</p>
  <p>After immersing the fabric, allow it to remain from 2 to 3 minutes and then
    remove the brown or purple stain, which it will leave, by dipping the material
    into a solution of water, hydrogen peroxide, and acetic acid. Use 1 part
    hydrogen peroxide, 1 part acetic acid, and 
    2 parts water. A strong solution of permanganate may be prepared and kept
    in a fruit jar and diluted when needed.</p>
  <p>174. <strong>Bleaching Silk</strong>.&#8212;Silk cannot be bleached satisfactorily. It may
    be somewhat whitened, however, by dipping it in a solution made by pouring
    1 pint of boiling water over 1 tablespoonful of borax and adding 3 pints
    of cold water. Allow this to cool before dipping the silk. Repeat after drying
    if necessary.</p>
  <p>To whiten silk that has yellowed, another method is to put 1 tablespoonful
    of turpentine into 1 gallon of rinse water. This does not leave an odor.
    Commercial whiteners are also available.</p>
  <p>If white silk becomes unattractively yellow and cannot be restored, it is
    advisable to tint or dye it.</p>
  <h5><a name="tinting" id="tinting"></a>TINTING</h5>
  <p>175. Many women like undergarments in soft tints, or <em>pastel colors</em>, as such
    tints are called, expressing great fondness for petticoats, princesse slips,
    night dresses, camisoles, and combination suits 
    in pastel cr&ecirc;pe de Chine. Unfortunately, though, the tints that are most
    suitable for undergarments, as the pale yellows, pinks, blues, and lavenders,
    grow dim when the garments are washed, frequently becoming so murky-looking
    as to lose their beauty. It is possible, however, to restore such tints or,
    if desired, to change them entirely by means of tinting, a process in which
    tinting powder, soap dye, red ink, colored cr&ecirc;pe paper, or colored tissue
    paper is utilized as the coloring medium.</p>
  <p>Nor is tinting limited to soft, dainty fabrics and articles; it is just
    as successful in the case of draperies, sofa pillows, blankets, and rugs.
    With the exception that such articles are somewhat awkward to handle and
    require larger containers and more dye, the tinting of them is as simple
    as the tinting of a scarf or a step-in suit.</p>
  <p>176. <strong>Tinting Powders</strong>.&#8212;One of the simplest agents to use comes in powder
    form in various colors. These powders may be purchased at drug stores or
    at stores in which dyes are sold. The packages in which they come contain
    directions for their use.</p>
  <p>177. <strong>Soap Dyes</strong>.&#8212;In cake form, there are the soap dyes, which are sold
    in nearly all drug and department stores. These may be used for tinting and
    also for dyeing dark colors. The kinds of soap dye that may be used without
    boiling are especially convenient, in that the soap dye accomplishes both
    the cleansing and the tinting of the garment in one operation. Besides, in
    the use of soap dyes, there is the added advantage that they do not discolor
    the hands nor the utensils employed in tinting the fabric.</p>
  <p>If the directions accompanying each cake of soap dye are carefully followed,
    the results will almost invariably prove satisfactory.</p>
  <p>178<a name="178" id="178"></a>. <strong>Colored-Paper or Ink Tinting</strong>.&#8212;If it is not possible to procure
    regular tinting materials, tissue or cr&ecirc;pe paper may be utilized.</p>
  <p>This type of tinting is possible only after the garment to be treated has
    been washed and rinsed without bluing. To a fresh rinse water, add lemon
    juice in the proportion of 1 tablespoonful to 1 gallon of water, the purpose
    of which is to aid in distributing the color evenly. If it is not convenient
    to use lemon juice, vinegar in the same proportion will answer. Next, dip
    into the water a 3- or 4-inch 
    square of tissue or cr&ecirc;pe paper, the color of which is several shades deeper
    than the color desired for the garment, and squeeze the color out of it.</p>
  <p>179. Stir the coloring into the water with the hand, and then dip a scrap
    of cloth into the water to make sure that the tint is as desired. Of course,
    the tint will appear a little deeper while the sample is wet than it will
    when dry. However, care must be taken not to get the tint too deep. Next,
    rinse the garment in this tinted water, dipping it quickly so as not to permit
    the formation of streaks. If the tint is not deep enough the first time,
    dip the garment again. Then wring it out thoroughly and make ready to dry
    or to iron, as the material demands. If the material must be dried before
    ironing, shake it frequently during the drying so as to avoid streaking.</p>
  <p>As a rule, very firm materials are not satisfactory when tinted, as they
    have a tendency to streak, but all soft fabrics will yield naturally to the
    treatment described.</p>
  <p>180<a name="180" id="180"></a>. The colors obtained by tinting are not always &quot;fast&quot; because
    they are not boiled in, and must therefore be renewed each time the fabric
    is washed. Some women do not consider fading a disadvantage, however, for
    in this way a change of color may be had each time a garment is washed.</p>
  <p>When pressing garments that have been tinted, protect the ironing board
    with an old cloth, as the color is likely to stain the cloth slightly.</p>
  <p>181. <strong>Dry Tinting</strong>.&#8212;The dry-tinting method is occasionally used to color
    laces, since it does not destroy the new look as does immersing them in a
    wet solution. The coloring compound is made by mixing dry powder-paint and
    corn-starch. Practically all the tints needed can be obtained by the use
    of ocher, Prussian blue, black, carmine, and brown in various combinations
    and proportions. Simply stir a small quantity of the desired color into the
    corn-starch, increasing the amount of paint until the correct tint is obtained.
    Then rub the colored corn-starch in the lace that is to be tinted, and lay
    aside between papers until it has taken a sufficiently deep tint.</p>
  <h5><a name="odors" id="odors"></a>WASHING GARMENTS HAVING OFFENSIVE ODORS</h5>
  <p>182. To wash garments having offensive odors, use <em>formaldehyde</em> in the water
    in which such clothes are soaked. About 1 teaspoonful to 1 quart of cold
    water is a sufficient proportion. Formaldehyde may injure the skin; therefore,
    the clothes should be lifted on a stick and rinsed thoroughly before washing.</p>
  <h5><a name="infected" id="infected"></a>STERILIZING INFECTED CLOTHING</h5>
  <p>183. Boiling is the simplest method of sterilization. Heat may be injurious
    to some articles, however, so they must be disinfected before washing by
    immersing them in certain solutions.</p>
  <p>184. The <strong>U. S. Public Health Service</strong> gives the following directions for
    handling infected clothing. Bed linen used, or clothes worn, by a person
    suffering from, or exposed to, a contagious disease, may be disinfected previous
    to washing by immersion for one hour in one of the following solutions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A 5-per-cent. dilution of the commercial solution of <em>formaldehyde</em> (<em>formalin</em>).</li>
    <li> A 1-per-cent. solution of <em>phenol</em> (<em>pure carbolic acid</em>).</li>
    <li> A 1/4-per-cent. solution of <em>cresol</em> (<em>liquor cresolis compositus</em>).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Infected clothing may also be readily sterlized by immersing in <em>boiling
    water for 10 minutes</em>.</p>
  <p>Woolen goods may be disinfected by immersing in <em>water maintained at
      a temperature of 165 degrees F. for 20 minutes</em>. If the goods are then carefully washed
    and dried, no undue shrinkage of the garments should result and the infectious
    agents of disease, except those due to spore-forming bacteria, such as anthrax
    and gas gangrene, will have been destroyed.</p>
  <p>Soaking in a cleaning solution prior to the disinfecting process, may prove
    advantageous in removing the dirt and stains. These cleaning solutions may
    be readily sterilized after use by boiling them in the containers in which
    they are used. The person who handles the infected garments should wear some
    form of apron to protect the clothing, and this apron should be disinfected
    immediately after the soiled clothes are handled. Also, the hands and forearms
    should be thoroughly scrubbed with soap, water, and a nail brush for 10 minutes
    by the clock, and thoroughly rinsed in either phenol 
    solution or the cresolis solution mentioned above or in a 1:1000 solution
    of bichloride of mercury.</p>
  <p>These precautions are necessary in order to prevent the germs on the clothes
    from being carried to the mouth of the one handling the clothes or indirectly
    to the mouths of others.</p>

  <h1>1931 - Laundering and Dry Cleaning<br />
  <span class="small"><em>Woman's Institute of Domestic Arts &amp; Sciences</em>,
 by Mary Brooks Picken</span></h1>
  <h2>Preface</h2>
  <p>To present a well-groomed appearance at all times is largely a matter of
    keeping one's clothes fresh and unspotted, not at all a difficult matter
    when one knows exactly how to launder them and to freshen them by approved
  dry-cleaning methods.</p>
  <p>The <a href="ldc-01.html">first Section</a> of this volume deals with <em>Laundering</em> in all its phases.
    It begins with the various kinds of equipment and laundry aids, and then
    takes up each step in the laundry process for all types of clothes, thus
    rendering the work efficient, lightening labor, and contributing to the convenience
    of the housewife. Each process, from the simplest to the most elaborate,
    is explained with the attention to detail that leaves no room for uncertainty
    or guesswork.</p>
  <p>Sure methods produce sure results, and so the housewife or laundress learns
    invariably to wash white clothes without yellowing, colored clothes without
    fading, and to make starch that does not stick. She learns the secrets of
    laundering fine articles and exactly how to press or iron various types of
    garments and materials successfully. In short, she learns to secure the uniformly
    successful results that make laundering a successful process.</p>
  <p>The woman who is fastidious and thrifty in the upkeep of her clothing, will
    have full reason to appreciate the thoroughness and explicitness of the <a href="ldc-06.html">Section
    on <em>Dry Cleaning</em></a>. The methods of the professional cleaner, simplified and
    adapted to home use, make this Section a unique contribution to housewifely
    lore.</p>
  <p>As an aid in stain removal is given a <a href="ldc-09.html#table">table</a> which includes the names of
    all common stains and the reagents and methods to use in removing them from
    different materials.</p>
  <p>In addition to the various steps in dry cleaning, which are covered in detail,
    is included the dry cleaning of such special articles as <a href="ldc-14.html#fur">furs</a>, <a href="ldc-14.html#glove">gloves</a>, <a href="ldc-14.html#hat">hats</a>,
    <a href="ldc-14.html#feather">feathers</a>, <a href="ldc-14.html#velvet">velvets</a>, <a href="ldc-14.html#silk">silks</a>, <a href="ldc-14.html#lace">laces</a>, <a href="ldc-14.html#ribbon">ribbons</a>, and numerous <a href="ldc-14.html#misc">miscellaneous
    articles</a>.</p>
  <p>Throughout the descriptions of the various processes, causes are linked
    up with effects so that one learns not only <em>how</em> but <em>why</em>    certain processes should be employed. By avoiding the pitfalls of the inexperienced
    and taking advantage of tested methods, one learns to dry clean without wrinkling
    or streaking and successfully to freshen and restore all sorts of articles,
    prolonging the life and usefulness of clothing and household effects.</p>

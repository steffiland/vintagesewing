<h3><b><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="dress" id="dress"></a></font></i></b>CUTTING THE DRESS</h3>
  <h4>Understand the
    pattern </h4>
  <p>To be successful in cutting out the dress, not only the pattern but the
    material should be understood, as patterns are placed differently on different
    materials. These two subjects have been fully explained in the lessons on
    <a href="hsc-1.html#choose">patterns</a> and the lessons on <a href="hsc-1.html#material">materials</a>.</p>
  <h4>    Check for
cutting </h4>
  <p>As an extra precaution, it is well to review some of the important items
    to check before the scissors are actually placed into the material. Cultivate
    the habit of going over these questions each time a garment is ready to cut:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>  If the material is folded double, is there a straight edge at the
    top?</li>
    <li> Is there a nap or a pile in the material?</li>
    <li> Are there any large floral patterns to be arranged ?</li>
    <li> Are there any stripes to match?</li>
    <li> Are all the important sections of the pattern placed?</li>
    <li> Has each section been placed on the correct thread?</li>
    <li> Is there sufficient material?</li>
    <li> Are all necessary seam allowances made?</li>
    <li> Has the hem been allowed?</li>
    <li> Has the pattern been placed economically?</li>
    <li> Has the belt been planned?</li>
    <li> Are all necessary small sections planned?</li>
    <li> If the pattern is asymmetric, are the right and left sides placed
                              correctly?</li>
    <li> Is the pattern pinned <strong>exactly</strong> on the fold?</li>
    <li> Has any special seam finish been allowed?</li>
    <li> Has extra length or width been allowed?</li>
    <li> Name and identify the sections to determine
                                      if all the back, front, and sleeves have
            been planned.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>After repeating these rules and checking the pattern the scissors can be
    used and not before.</p>
  <h4>    Plan the layout </h4>
  <p>The beginner is usually too quick with the scissors. She is so eager to
    make the dress that she cuts the first section of the pattern without regard
    for the other sections; she opens the pattern and goods and cuts the first
    piece that comes to hand. This often ends in disaster for if wider seams
    are allowed or a wider hem is made, the layout will change and she will find
    that all the pattern may not be cut from her material. Or if the layout is
    disregarded, some small important section such as the front yoke of the skirt
    may be omitted, and if the material is a remnant, the dress is ruined. There
    may have been an abundance of large sections left and had the pattern been
    shifted before the first piece was cut the dress might have been saved.</p>
  <p>Therefore, follow the pattern layout if possible and place <strong>all the
    sections</strong>    before the first piece is cut and then pin the pattern down.</p>
  <h4>    Press the goods </h4>
  <p>Cutting can be accomplished to better advantage if the goods is pressed
    before cutting. If the material is a remnant, all the creases should be pressed
    out. If it is soiled, it should be cleaned. The heavy crease down the center
    of the folded goods should be at least partially pressed out as it is difficult
    to make the goods lie flat when this center fold is not used as a fold when
    cutting. The exact width is important on the cross-back and a bulge in the
    material will make the back wider.</p>
  <h4>    Insufficient
material </h4>
  <p>If there is insufficient material to cut the desired pattern, it is advisable
    to select another pattern that can be cut from less material. Patterns of
    bisymmetrical design, in which both sides are alike, can usually be cut from
    less material than those of angular cuts. Dresses with the front or back
    cut with a center seam or opening will also cut to better advantage. This
    permits this part of the pattern to utilize part of the material on the selvage
    edge. When all the sections are cut on a fold, it often requires more material.</p>
  <h4>    Modify the
pattern </h4>
  <p>It may be possible to modify the pattern to utilize the goods at hand. This
    is often necessary when remodeling. The sleeves could be shortened; a cuff
    could be added; a strip of material be set across the sleeve as a trimming;
    an inverted box pleat might be placed down the back of the waist making a
    seam under the pleat; a yoke effect made across the upper back or across
    the front would take a smaller section. It might be an advantage to set godets
    into the skirt. Or it might be possible to add some contrasting material
    in the waist and sleeves as a trimming. If other material is added to the
    waist, plan also to have some trimming on the sleeves so as to balance the
    design.</p>
  <h4>    Haste makes
waste </h4>
  <p>Take time to cut. Plan to be undisturbed. Keep your mind on what is being
    done, as it is easy to make one wrong cut that might ruin the garment. It
    is advisable to be alone when cutting, it may be interesting to sew with
    friends, but a friendly visit will interfere with the cutting operation.</p>
  <p>Use a large flat surface (see <a href="hsc-1.html#choose">lessons on patterns</a>). Two or three card tables
    are excellent if a long table is not available. The soft surface is excellent
    for pinning the goods to place. Do not cut on the bed, the floor would be
    preferable if no tables are available, but use papers or a sheet to keep
    the material clean.</p>
  <h4>    Plenty of pins </h4>
  <p>Use plenty of pins when cutting. You have purchased a pattern, and the lines
    of the pattern should be followed. This cannot be done by guess. Pin the
    pattern along the sewing lines with the pins resting in the line as they
    will be used later. Lay aside the sections as they are cut but do not remove
    the pattern.</p>
  <p>Practice each problem as given.</p>
<h3>    <b><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="cutting" id="cutting"></a></font></i></b>Cutting</h3>
  <h4> Crooked cutting
    causes misfits </h4>
  <p>It is difficult for the home sewer to cut edges sufficiently straight and
    true to the pattern to be able to machine-stitch the seam without marking
    the sewing line. This is especially important when working with a perfect
    fitting pattern as a half-inch variation on seams may produce a misfit in
    the garment.</p>
  <h4>    Home sewers
    have difficulty
cutting straight </h4>
  <p>The factory cutter has the advantage over the home cutter in that he has
    a long cutting table, several thicknesses of material that aid in retaining
    the flatness of the material, heavy flat patterns that do not require perfect
    pinning on all edges, and an electric cutting machine that glides over the
    material without shifting the goods. The home sewer is cutting no more than
    two thicknesses of fabric, and she may be obliged to cut on a small surface
    with scissors that are not as sharp as they might be. Under these circumstances
    it is indeed difficult for her to cut a true line for stitching. But the
    sewing lines of all the dress can be marked in a few minutes, and, although
    everyone should try to develop skill in cutting a clean, true edge, it is
    even more important to sew on the given sewing line than it is to cut a perfectly
    straight line to use as a guide for stitching.</p>
  <h4>    Cut to end
of blades </h4>
  <p>There is an art in cutting straight lines and curves with the shears. Practice
    with goods as it lies flat on the table; striped material or paper napkins
    can be used. Open the blades of the shears wide, set them on the goods high
    into the shears and then close them to the ends of the blades. Repeat the
    operation until the full line is cut. The long stroke prevents the heckled
    edges produced by short strokes.</p>
  <h4>    Cutting curves </h4>
  <p>Curves are cut in the same manner except that the scissors are gradually
    turned with the curve, but the curve is cut in one stroke, starting at the
    open end of the shears and continuing to the ends of the blades, turning
    the shears while cutting. Mark circles on the paper napkin and cut the curves.
    This method will eliminate heckled edges.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/02_clip.jpg" alt="inner corner with notched clip" width="117" height="122" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Clip corners</h4>
  <p>All inner corners should be clipped in when the dress is being cut out.
    Clip in the corner while the pattern rests on the material. The clip will
    be made to within an eighth of an inch of the sewing line so that the seam
    may be turned back later when the sewing line is marked. Failure to clip
    points often results in curved corners.</p>
<h3>    <b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><a name="scissors" id="scissors"></a></i></font></b>Sharpening Scissors</h3>
  <h4>      Sharpen scissors
    at home </h4>
  <p>Sharp scissors are necessary for sewing and can easily be kept sharp. Keep
    a small whetstone in the sewing box and when the scissors become dull, sharpen
    them at home.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/02_sharpen.jpg" alt="open scissors with arrows pointing to beveled edges" width="132" height="72" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Sharpen bevel
edge</h4>
  <p>Rest the open scissors on the table or machine, holding them in the left
    hand. As the blades are open you will notice the edge of the blade. It has
    a flat bevel edge&#8212;not a sharp edge like a knife. It is this narrow,
    flat edge that is to be sharpened and not THE FLAT SIDES OF THE BLADES. Many
    scissors are ruined when the flat sides of the blades are sharpened.</p>
  <p>With the blades open, sharpen the bevel edge across the top of the lower
    blade that is resting on the table, rubbing the whetstone over the narrow
    edge from the outer sides of the scissors to the inner side, which will be
    rubbing from the right to the left. Make several strokes with the stone until
    the full length of the blade has been sharpened. Then reverse the handles
    and sharpen the other blade.</p>
  <p>Try the scissors or shears and if there still remains one dull spot, repeat
    the operation on this place. You will be pleasingly surprised at the results.</p>
  <h4>    Scissors oil
on fingers </h4>
  <p>Did you know that you carry your scissors oil with you? If your scissors
    squeak or bind, rub each blade with the fingers. There is sufficient natural
    oil on the hands to oil the scissors and they will then run smooth without
    having oil dripping on the material. If they are rusty between the blades,
    it may be necessary to drop one drop of sewing machine oil where the blades
    are joined.</p>
  <h4>    Blunt machine
needles sharpened </h4>
  <p>Blunt sewing-machine needles can also be sharpened with the whetstone. The
    curled point that is usually caused by pulling the material backward on the
    machine too rapidly, can be sharpened off with a few strokes on the stone.
    The needle can then be used for the heavier sewing or for practice work.</p>
<h3>    <b><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="ripping" id="ripping"></a></font></i></b>Ripping</h3>
  <h4> Rip if necessary </h4>
  <p>One of the first lessons in sewing is to learn to acquire the patience to &quot;rip&quot;.
    A good seamstress must have the determination to produce perfect results
    even if she must rip. She is not satisfied to leave something unfinished
    or to permit a mistake to be left in the garment. She has pride in her work
    to produce the best results which may require some ripping.</p>
  <p>The better the sewing problems are understood the less ripping will be necessary
    for it is usually inexperience in handling a different material that may
    produce poor results. Therefore carefully follow all the construction problems
    and mistakes will not be made.</p>
  <h4>    Ripping by
pulling threads </h4>
  <p>The most perfect method of ripping is by pulling out the threads. A chain
    stitch will be pulled from the loop end of the stitch and the lock stitch
    will be drawn out from the bobbin thread if it is loose. If the stitch is
    tight, first one thread and then the other will be drawn out. This method
    requires more time but will not draw the goods out of shape.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/02_chain.jpg" alt="Chain stitch with end loop" width="78" height="91" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Chain stitch
    opened from
loop end</h4>
  <p>Many dressmakers prefer the chain stitch machine because it is easy to rip
    but it also has its disadvantages. It is often difficult to find which end
    of the seam to rip. Many sugar sacks are sewed with chain stitch also and
    test the patience of the housewife when trying to open them without cutting
    the cloth.</p>
  <p>A chain stitch makes a series of knots after it leaves the material. Therefore
    it should be cut off close to the end of the seam. Examine the stitch and
    determine which end is the loop-end of the stitch (see illustration). The
    ripping will start from the loop end. Pick out the thread from the loop and
    the thread will then pull out.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/02_razor.jpg" alt="Safety razor blade" width="122" height="67" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Razor blade
for ripping</h4>
  <p>The razor blade is indispensable for ripping. Use the blades with the ridge
    on one edge and the finger will not be cut. Pin one end of the seam to the
    basting board which is either held in the lap or rests flat on the table,
    and draw on the other edge of the seam until the machine stitch is visible.
    Touch this thread with the razor blade and it will separate. Draw down again
    and touch the thread, gradually repeating the operation until the full length
    of the seam is ripped. Touch the thread only and not the goods.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/02_pulling.jpg" alt="fabric split two-thirds of the way up along the middle" width="132" height="143" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Ripping by
    pulling the
goods</h4>
  <p>If the garment is old and the threads are worn, the seam can be opened by
    pulling but be sure to <strong>rip against the threads of the goods</strong>. That is, if
    it is a skirt seam, rip from the bottom upward rather than from the top downward
    as the crosswise threads tear more readily than the lengthwise.</p>
  <h4>    Scissors ripping </h4>
  <p>When ripping with scissors, grasp them in the hand near the points. Open
    them a very small space and &quot;clip&quot; the thread. Do not lay scissors
    in the lap when sewing as they are liable to be drawn closed when they are
    picked up and may cut the dress.</p>
  <p>Practice each problem as given.</p>

  <h3>    <b><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="marking" id="marking"></a></font></i></b>MARKING SEWING LINES</h3>
  <h4> Press mark
    seams </h4>
  <p>Stitching a straight seam without a line to follow not only requires perfect
    cutting but also an accurate eye for gauging the correct distance between
    the cut edge and the needle. As very few people have a true eye for measure,
    it is advisable not to depend on the eye for true stitching but to actually
    crease mark a true line for basting and stitching. After the material has
    been cut the sewing line is then pressed, marking all the dress very quickly.
    This may seem to be a waste of time, but the time saved in ripping is not
    only a saving of time later but is also a saving on the nerves. This is especially
    true on all intricate joinings such as curves and angles and all fitting
    lines on the sides of the garment. The time spent in crease marking the seams
    is repaid in the perfect results when basting.</p>
  <h4>    Crease marking </h4>
  <p>There are several methods advocated for marking seams but they are too impractical
    to use and for this reason they are seldom used by the dressmaker. But there
    is a quicker method used by French dressmakers which will simplify the whole
    process of making the garment; namely, creasing the seams at the sewing line
    with a hot iron.</p>
  <p>Practically all materials other than velvets and heavy woolens can be marked
    in this manner. Cottons, silks, synthetic fabrics, light woolens and linens
    can all be creased and will retain the crease until the seam is basted. Not
    only are the seams marked with a crease but a crease will perfect the lines
    of darts, tucks, pleats and corners so perfectly that sewing is made easy.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/02_prep.jpg" alt="pattern piece pinned to fabric and cut out" width="97" height="160" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Preparation</h4>
  <p>Preparation for the creasing should be made when the pattern is pinned to
    the goods. If the pattern is to be cut double, then both the right and left
    sides will be creased in one operation. The pattern should be pinned to the
    goods along the sewing line so that the pins rest along the line of the seam
    and in it when creased. This requires careful pinning which is also necessary
    when sewing perfectly by a pattern. The pattern has been made for a given
    size and all the seams have been added. For the dress to fit as it was intended
    for the standard figure, the seam must be made at a given space from the
    edge of the pattern; each pattern having its respective seam allowance. When
    the given sewing line is followed accurately, a wider seam allowance may
    be cut to permit a let-out or to give more material for seam finish in fraying
    materials. The let-out is most essential for perfect fitting but whether
    the goods is let out retaken in, any alteration should be made from the actual
    sewing line and the crease will give it perfectly.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/02_press.jpg" alt="seams pressed along sewing line" width="80" height="142" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Press the seam</h4>
  <p>Lay aside the sections as they are cut until all the dress is cut out. Do
    not remove the pattern from the material. Place the pattern with the material
    pinned to it on the press board with the pattern side down. Fold back the
    edge of the pattern until the right amount of seam is allowed and press the
    turned edge with an iron that is not too hot. This will make a straight true
    line for basting on both right and left sides.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/02_darts.jpg" alt="front with underarm side dart marked" width="97" height="166" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Marking darts</h4>
  <p>All tucks and darts should be marked when marking the seams. Place a pin
    along the line of the tuck or dart with the pins resting in the sewing line.
    Pick up the goods with the pattern pinned to it and press the line of the
    dart or tuck. Press one side of the dart and then the other side making two
    lines that intersect. Tucks will be creased in the same manner.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    End of tucks
marked</h4>
  <p><img src="images/02_tucks-marked.jpg" alt="tucks marked on neckline" width="97" height="163" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Place a row of pins close together down each tuck indicated on the pattern
    and through both thicknesses of material as folded. Lift each tuck by the
    pins and fold over with the pins protruding and press the line of the tuck.
    After all the tucks are marked with a straight crease, fold down the goods
    across the end of the row of tucks and press mark a cross-crease as a line
    for ending.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/02_pleats.jpg" alt="pleated section of fabric" width="132" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Pleated crease</h4>
  <p>Pleated sections should be pinned to the pattern singly. First one side
    to be marked and then the other side, right and left sides not marked together
    as the double creasing makes one side with a reverse crease which is confusing
    when laying pleats, as each pleat on one side of the dress would have to
    be turned on the crease.</p>
  <h4>    Reversing creases
of pleats	(Make a paper sample of this problem.)</h4>
  <p>One of the advantages of creasing is that both the right and left sides
    are marked simultaneously. But&#8212;when both are marked, one side will
    have the edges of the crease folded the wrong way and will have to be reversed
    when sewing. The sewing line has been marked, however, and gives a true line
    for basting.</p>
  <h4>    Pleats </h4>
  <p>All dart and tuck lines are easily reversed but pleats should lie flat when
    marked and it is advisable to pin the pattern to the goods with the pattern
    on the right side of the material pinning down the line of the pleats. If
    perforations are used on the pattern it is advisable to first crease mark
    the line for folding and follow the creased line for the pinning. Fold over
    the pleat as indicated by the pattern and press it just as it will lie when
    made into the dress.</p>
  <h4>    Hem line
marked </h4>
  <p>A trial hem can also be creased when the dress is being marked, pressing
    up all skirt sections on the hem allowance. A trial fitting is always more
    satisfactory when the hem is basted so as to better determine the correct
    length.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/02_corners.jpg" alt="inner corner clipped and folded under, and matching inner and outer angles also clipped and folded back" width="132" height="168" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /><a name="points" id="points"></a>Corners clipped</h4>
  <p>All inner corners should be clipped, when the dress is cut (as directed).
    It will then be possible to press back the sewing lines of the edges of the
    angle when is quite necessary when basting perfect points. The clip should
    be made to within two or three threads of the actual sewing line so as to
    make a perfect point. Press mark all sewing lines of intricate points and
    angles.</p>
  <h4>   Mark all
    fitting lines </h4>
  <p>It is important to press mark all side seams of the dress as these seams
    will be the fitting lines, the side seams of the waist and skirt and also
    the sleeves.</p>
  <h4>    Unnecessary to
mark curves </h4>
  <p>It is not necessary to press mark curves of the neck, armhole or sleeve
    cap. It is advisable, however, to press mark the back section at the cross
    back on the straight section of the back. The curve under the arm need not
    be marked. Cut narrow seams on all curves, especially inner curves as a wide
    seam makes the curve smaller.</p>
  <p>With the seams all creased it is a simple matter to match the creases and
    either pin the sections together on the crease and stitch, or baste the seams
    and then stitch. Assembling the dress will be explained later.</p>

inner marks</h4>
  <p>Tailor's tacks are used only for marking inner lines and curves such as
    in the placement of a pocket, but they are seldom used by the dressmaker
    for marking seams.</p>
  <p>If the pattern had printed lines, holes must be clipped into the line of
    the pocket for the tack. Use a double strand of thread. Take two stitches
    through the perforation leaving the second stitch with a loop above the stitch.
    Skip to the next perforation and take two more stitches leaving a loop above
    the stitch, repeat if necessary.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/02_separate.jpg" alt="fabric with tailor's tacks being clipped and separated" width="132" height="171" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Separate</h4>
  <p>It will then be necessary to clip the long threads that join the two stitches
    between the perforations. The pattern cannot be removed unless they are clipped
    apart and the stitches will be pulled out after the goods is separated if
    this long thread remains.</p>
  <p>After the long stitch is severed, FOLD THE GOODS BACK CAREFULLY PARALLEL
    WITH AT LEAST TWO OF THE STITCHES, opening the material until both stitches
    are visible. Draw them apart only sufficiently wide to clip them apart. The
    shorter the stitches the better they will remain in the goods. After all
    the stitches are clipped apart, trim off the long threads on top of the goods.
    If the stitches are separated one at a time, they will usually be pulled
    out of the goods; opening two or more at a time helps to hold them firm until
    they are separated.</p>
  <h4>    Tailor's chalk </h4>
  <p>Tailor's chalk is indispensable in the sewing room if accuracy is desired.
    It is used for marking straight lines, bias strips, hems, alterations and
    various other uses.</p>
  <p>When using tailor's chalk to mark a straight line, follow the edge of a
    yardstick or long ruler. Soft materials usually must be marked in dash lines
    to keep from displacing the material. Bias binding material should also be
    marked true with chalk marking dash lines.</p>
  <h4>    Blocking
material </h4>
  <p>Tailor's chalk is also used when blocking out an original pattern or when
    cutting from a pattern with no seams allowed. If no seams are allowed on
    the pattern, it is always advisable to make a dash line for cutting as a
    warning not to cut off the seam allowance. This seam allowance can then be
    pressed back over the edge of the pattern which gives the actual sewing line.</p>
  <h4>    Tracing wheel </h4>
  <p>A tracing wheel is seldom used on materials but it is invaluable when tracing
    off patterns for a duplication of it, or when tracing dress lines to match
    for making some section for remodeling a garment.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/02_mark.jpg" alt="crooked stitching line shows when seam is pressed" width="132" height="174" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Important!
    Mark for
stitching</h4>
  <p>It is even more necessary to crease mark for stitching than it is for basting
    as it is sometimes necessary to alter the basted lines. But after the desired
    fitting is secured and the basting has been made, place the dress on the
    press board wrong side out and press all the seams over to one side to make
    a straight crease for stitching. THE SEAM IS <strong>NOT</strong> OPENED.</p>
  <p>This crease will eliminate any crooks in the basting which are easy to make
    by the most particular worker as some material slips and slides easily which
    makes it difficult to handle. Points and angles should always be crease marked
    before stitching, also all side seams and long seams of skirts.</p>
  <p>After the crease has been made, LIFT THE CREASED SEAM AND FOLLOW THE CREASE
    WHEN MACHINE STITCHING AND THE LINE OF THE SEAM WILL BE PERFECT.</p>
  <h4>    Stitching without
basting </h4>
  <p>It is possible to stitch without basting if one is experienced in sewing,
    but it usually results in much ripping for the amateur.</p>
  <p>The factory operator never bastes but she sews thousands of the same seams
    and soon becomes an expert in her work. If the home sewer is working with
    gingham or some firmly woven material it MAY be safe to stitch without basting
    but silks and soft materials should always be basted.</p>
  <p>Practice each problem as given.</p>

<h3 class="clear">  <b><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="darts" id="darts"></a></font></i></b>MAKING DARTS AND TUCKS</h3>
<h4>    <img src="images/02_defined.jpg" alt="large dart marked from shoulder seam to breast point" width="111" height="168" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Darts defined</h4>
<p>Darts are made with two given lines that converge at a given point. These
    lines when joined, will lift the seam the width of the space between the
    lines and produce a curved surface to fit the curves of the body. Darts slant
    toward the curve wherever placed.</p>
  <p>It is not always a large bust that produces a dart but also an erect posture.
    The shoulders will then recede and will produce a sloping line from the shoulders
    to the waist. The body is thicker through the center than at the shoulder
    line.</p>
  <h4>    Darts on waist </h4>
  <p>Darts are usually found on the front of the waist either at the shoulder
    seam or the underarm seam. Princess lines also require more darts as there
    will be more curves of the body to fit.</p>
  <h4>    Darts on skirts
and sleeves </h4>
  <p>Darts are also placed at the back of skirts to fit the curve of the body
    below the waist line. Sleeves that are cut in one with the shoulder may also
    have darts. Darts are also used in the designs of full sleeves.</p>
  <p>Wherever darts are made they should be made carefully; poorly made darts
    are very evident. It is important that dart lines be followed carefully.
    If the pattern calls for a straight dart, the lines must be stitched perfectly
    straight. If the dart is curved, the curve must be followed exactly. To make
    straight dart lines mark the lines of the dart with a continuous line and
    not a few tailor's tacks, as they are not sufficient for a perfectly straight
    line for basting. Mark with a ruler if necessary, using tailor's chalk.</p>
  <h4>    <a name="basting" id="basting"></a>Basting </h4>
  <p>When basting a dart, pin it the full length and then baste from the point
    outward, but when stitching it stitch from the seam inward. The dart should
    not twist when basted. There should be no fullness to ease into the edges
    of darts.</p>
  <h4>    Crease marks </h4>
  <p>It is advisable to straighten the sewing line of the dart after it is basted
    and before it is stitched. Draw a chalk line on heavy material, using a ruler.
    Thin material can be creased marked by dropping the bulk of the material
    over the end of the press-board so that the curve below the dart is at the
    end of the board. Press the dart to one side to straighten the line.</p>
  <h4>    Under-arm darts </h4>
  <p>Under-arm darts are shorter than shoulder-darts and are used on many dresses
    that have no other method of fitting the curves of the front. When darts
    are not desired, gathers at the waist line can be used but they are not always
    required. It is possible to stretch some material and eliminate darts, but
    it is not always possible and seldom advisable.</p>
  <h4>    Shoulder dart </h4>
  <p>The shoulder dart is much longer than the under-arm dart. The front edge
    is on a straighter thread of material than the back edge. Be sure to mark
    the sewing lines with a crease or chalk before basting; match the lines and
    pin before basting. Pin and baste with the material flat on the table. After
    stitching, tie the end threads to prevent the thread from working through
    and loosening the stitch.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/02_point.jpg" alt="completed dart from shoulder seam to breast point" width="96" height="125" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Point</h4>
  <p>Darts on heavy material should be trimmed off and pressed open, cutting
    off the dart to a half-inch seam and then splitting the end to within an
    eighth of an inch of the point. If moisture can be used, press as directed
    in rules for pressing.</p>
  <p>Place the point of the dart over the end of the press board so that it will
    lie flat. Press over the point and any fullness will disappear if it is stitched
    correctly.</p>
  <h4>    Skirt darts </h4>
  <p>Skirt darts on light weight material are not cut open but are pressed toward
    the center on the wrong side so as to form a panel effect on the back. Heavy
    material is always split and pressed open. Under-arm darts are usually pressed
    downward and are not split.</p>
  <h4>    Tucks </h4>
  <p>Many dresses are made with tucks at the back of the neck or at the shoulder
    in front. These tucks should be crease-marked as directed in marking sewing
    lines so that it will not be necessary to waste time in measuring. Small
    tucks are usually made on the wrong side of the goods and are called &quot;Inverted&quot; tucks.
    Tucks differ from darts in that they are made the same width the full length
    of the tuck or nearly so while a dart is stitched to a point. Pin tucks are
    made very narrow and are used as a trimming.</p>
  <h4>    Stitching
tacking </h4>
  <p>Stitch the tuck from the seam end to the dress end of the tuck so that the
    end threads will be loose and perfect for tying. If the material is of firm
    weave it can be held firm at the end when stitching. When the end of the
    tuck is reached, hold the goods and prevent it from feeding under the needle
    so that two or more machine stitches will be made at the end of the tuck.
    The threads can then be trimmed off without tying.</p>
  <p>After the darts and tucks are basted, the dress is ready to be assembled
    unless there are bound buttonholes to make. These should be made on the sections
    before they are basted together. Instructions for bound buttonholes will
    be given in Series 3.</p>
  <p>Practice each problem as given.</p>

  <h3>    <b><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="practical" id="practical"></a></font></i></b>PRACTICAL STITCHES</h3>
  <h4>    Threading </h4>
  <p>As sewing is based on needlework, the first lesson should be in threading
    and handling the needle. Thread dark thread into the needle against a light
    background and light thread against a dark background. If there is difficulty
    in seeing the eye of the needle, use crewel needles with long eyes. Baste
    with fine, soft thread. There is now a small cone of thread offered which
    is much better to use for basting than the stiff basting thread. Do not use
    a long thread, no longer than can be pulled off the spool with one reach.
    If the dress is basted in white thread, any alterations should be basted
    in colored thread so as to designate the correct mark for alteration.</p>
<h4 class="clear"> <img src="images/02_knotting.jpg" alt="pair of threaded hand-sewing needles with thread knotted at opposite ends" width="132" height="164" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Thread knotting</h4>
<p>Thread often knots when it is sewed by hand. This is caused by the knot
    being placed on the wrong end of the thread. The thread in the needle turns
    as each stitch is taken and if it retwists rather than twisting tighter it
    will cause the thread to form a tangle of tiny knots similar to the knots
    in a piece of twine retwisted in the fingers. If the thread knots, tack it,
    break it off and draw down the short end of the thread for a new knot and
    proceed to sew.</p>
  <p>Knot the end of the thread by circling the thread around the finger once
    only, and drawing down the thread into a knot. Bastings should be tacked
    only when there is a strain on the seam that is basted. Otherwise overlap
    the bastings and do not tack them. Closely tacked bastings are difficult
    to remove after the machine stitching is made on top of them, and the heavy
    tacking increases this difficulty.</p>
  <h4>    Thimble </h4>
  <p>The thimble is placed on the middle finger of the right hand if the seamstress
    is right handed. It is used as a &quot;pusher&quot; for the needle and protects
    the end of the finger. Either the side or the end of the thimble can be used.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/02_holding.jpg" alt="hands holding fabric pinched between index fingers and thumbs so fabric can be guided along needle" width="132" height="104" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Holding the
goods</h4>
  <p>Many of the secrets of sewing are found in the correct method of holding
    the material. In all hand seaming and gathering, the goods rests <strong>between</strong>    the fingers. Place the needle in the goods at the beginning of the seam,
    then lift the seam into the fingers and hold the thumb in front of the seam
    and the first finger back of the seam and proceed to make the running stitch
    holding <strong>the needle steady, working the goods back and forth with
    the left hand in front of the needle point as the thimble pushes the needle
    forward</strong>.
    As one becomes accustomed to the position of the needle and thimble, the
    goods can be worked back and forth more rapidly and thus make the stitches
    smaller and faster. The right hand is held still and the left hand moves
    the goods.</p>
  <h4>    Necessary
stitches </h4>
  <p>It is necessary to learn but a few stitches to make a dress&#8212;plain
    running stitch, gathers, back stitch, plain basting and dressmaker's basting,
    machine stitching, and hemming.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/02_running.jpg" alt="seam formed with running stitch" width="132" height="50" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Running stitch</h4>
  <p>Small, even stitches are called running stitches. Use a medium-to-small
    needle to secure the best results. Number seven is a good average size. Be
    sure to hold the goods, needle and thimble as directed in the previous paragraph.</p>
  <h4>    Gathers </h4>
  <p>Gathers are made with a line of running stitches drawn up on the thread.
    The process is called gathering. The needle should not be removed from the
    goods the full length of the length to be gathered. As the needle is filled
    with the goods, it is pushed off the head of the needle and refilled, continuing
    to the end of the length to be gathered. This produces an unbroken line when
    finished.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/02_shirring.jpg" alt="fabric with four parallel rows of stitching to form shirring" width="132" height="86" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Shirring</h4>
  <p>Shirring is made with several rows of gathers placed close together. If
    several rows are to be hand-shirred, make the desired number of rows of running
    stitches but do not draw them up or tack any of the rows until they are all
    made. Then draw up all the rows in one operation and tack each thread separately.
    The width must be measured before tacking.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/02_tacking.jpg" alt="threaded needle back-stitching along seam line" width="132" height="107" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Back stitch:
tacking</h4>
  <p>A back stitch is used to prevent a stitch from slipping or drawing. It is
    a plain stitch taken back over the last stitch making a thread both above
    and below the stitch. When several back stitches are taken in one place it
    is called tacking.</p>
  <h4>    Flat basting </h4>
  <p>All long seams should be basted with the goods resting <strong>flat</strong> on the table.
    The goods is <strong>not</strong> picked up in the hands, but each stitch is picked through
    to the table or basting board. This may seem awkward at first, but it is
    the best way to baste straight. The more bias section of the seam should
    be uppermost just as gathers are placed uppermost. When extremely bias sections
    are to be basted, it is advisable to first machine stitch the raw edge of
    the bias section before it is placed on the matching section to be basted.
    Test it after it is stitched to see that it lies flat.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/02_basting.jpg" alt="seam formed with wide-spaced plain basting" width="132" height="55" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Plain basting</h4>
  <p>Plain basting is made with an even stitch. It differs from the running stitch
    in that it is a larger stitch and the stitches are farther apart. This basting
    is made in the hands.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/02_dressmakers.jpg" alt="seam formed with dreassmaker's basting" width="132" height="51" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Dressmaker's
basting</h4>
  <p>Dressmakers use a quick basting that holds the seam firmly in place with
    few stitches. Place the edges to be basted flat on the table with the more
    bias edge uppermost. Pin to position, chalk mark a straight line with the
    ruler if the seam is a long straight line. With a knotted double thread take
    two short stitches close together picking through to the table (do not pick
    the seam up in the hands), skip an inch-and-a-half space and take two more
    small stitches and continue to skip the space and make two small stitches.
    Do not tack the ends. The two small stitches hold the seam and prevent it
    from slipping and the long space speeds the work. This stitch holds much
    better than long loose bastings and gives a pleasing appearance.</p>
  <h4>    Necessary
seam finishes </h4>
  <p>The day of artistic needlework on the inside of a dress is past. Dresses
    are not worn for years as in the days of our grandmothers when the inside
    finish on a dress was a work of art; finished with yards of ribbon and embroidery
    stitching across the feather boning. The dress might well have been worn
    wrong side out. The inside finishes of today are for necessity more than
    for beauty and to keep the material from fraying. They are finished quickly
    if finished at all. More time should be spent on the problems of the outside
    of the dress rather than the finish of the seams. After all, the dress is
    to be worn right side out and is not examined on the inside. The inside should
    look neat and of a uniform appearance; the seams should be even and smooth
    but not necessarily finished with fancy stitches.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/02_pinking.jpg" alt="fabric edged with regular notches forming pinking" width="130" height="63" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Pinking</h4>
  <p>Pinking is the approved method of seam finish if the material is not of
    the fraying variety. All closely woven materials may be pinked with the handy
    pinking shears that are available today. The pinking can be done as the dress
    is cut out for the pinking shears are the cutting shears. If the goods is
    of firm weave and pinking shears are not available, then the seams can either
    remain unfinished or can be pinked by hand with the scissors, folding the
    seam double for clipping the point. The seam is pinked double and pressed
    open later.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/02_overcasting.jpg" alt="threaded needle overcasting fabric edge" width="123" height="63" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Overcasting</h4>
  <p>If the material frays, it should be trimmed off and overcast. If the seam
    is to be pressed open, each side of the seam is overcast separately. Be sure
    to trim off the loose threads, knot the thread and wind the needle around
    the edge of the seam as the thimble pushes the needle forward. As the thread
    is used up, do not tack it, but overlap a few stitches with the new thread,
    and continue. This prevents a drawing on the finish. As the seams will all
    be pressed open, even the armhole, be sure to clip all inner curves such
    as the waistline on the side seams and the armhole, so that the overcasting
    will not be cut when clipped later. After the seam is pressed, open for overcasting.
    It makes a neat finish and is quickly accomplished.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/02_dressmakers_tacks.jpg" alt="the three stages of forming dressmaker's tacks: set, clip, and separate" width="132" height="141" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Dressmaker's
tacks</h4>
  <p>Tailor's tacks are used for tailoring, as they are more difficult to make
    and require more time. The dressmaker uses a shorter method that simplifies
    the process, called dressmaker's tacks. The sewing line should be chalk marked.
    The seams should be laid flat on the table or a long basting board. Pin to
    position every six inches. Use a double thread without knotting. Pick up
    one short stitch through both edges, then skip a space of an inch and a half
    or two inches and pick up another short stitch. The shorter the threads are
    clipped the closer the material holds. Notice that the stitch is not looped
    as in the tailor's tack. The full length of the seam can be marked very quickly.
    After the full length is marked, <strong>clip apart</strong> the long stitch on top of the
    goods, the threads that joined the two short stitches; clip all threads along
    the full length of the seam. The seam is now ready to be separated, open
    the seam <strong>lengthwise</strong>, parallel to the cut edge, never from the top downward.
    Fold back the edge until three stitches are visible. Hold the under piece
    down with the points of the scissors and clip the double threads apart. Continue
    to open the seam carefully <strong>parallel</strong> with the edge until all the threads are
    opened. Then before the goods is raised from the table, trim off the top
    threads as close as possible, for the shorter the threads that protrude,
    the better they will remain in the goods.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/02_slip-stitch.jpg" alt="hem turned up and held with slip stitches" width="132" height="97" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Slip-stitched hem</h4>
  <p>As there is one hem that is used on practically all garments, this will
    be taught first. The tailor's slip stitch is somewhat different but will
    be learned in <a href="hsc-4.html#tailorslip">another lesson</a>. The hem is basted. The thread is caught to
    the dress or under section and in the same operation, the needle is <strong>slid
    into the fold</strong> of the hem before it is drawn out. Draw out the thread and
    catch two threads of the under section; on the same needle slide the needle
    into the hem and repeat to the end of the thread.</p>
  <h4>    Machine hems </h4>
  <p>Wide hems are made by hand, but narrow hems may be made by machine with
    the sewing machine attachments which may be used after much practice. Straight
    edges are simple to run by machine, but curves are more difficult if not
    impractical. Curved edges should be turned and basted before stitching. Machine
    stitch all hems close to the edge.</p>
<h4>    Occasional Stitches</h4>
  <p>The stitches explained in the <a href="#practical">previous lesson</a> are the stitches generally
    used and should be learned first, as the following stitches are seldom used
    and then on special materials or underwear.</p>
  <h4>    French seams </h4>
  <p>French seams are not often used in making dresses. They are especially adapted
    for use with thin materials and on garments that have straight lines and
    do not fit closely, such as infants' wear, nightgowns, etc. When French seams
    are much curved it is very difficult to allow sufficient fullness in the
    first stitching to permit the seam to be turned and stitched again without
    drawing. However, it is not difficult for the home sewer to achieve skill
    in handling this seam where conditions make it desirable if the seams are
    carefully basted. To make it, stitch a narrow seam on the right side of the
    garment. Clip off all loose threads. Turn the garment and stitch another
    seam on the wrong side, encasing the raw edges in the seam. In many cases
    the French seam can be replaced by the non-rip seam, which can be made in
    one stitching on the wrong side.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/02_non-rip.jpg" alt="two steps to forming non-rip seam" width="132" height="123" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Non-rip seam</h4>
  <p>This seam can be made on all underwear or any material where a finished
    seam is desired.</p>
  <p>Baste one edge of the seam back on the other edge, one-half of the seam
    allowance. For example, if a three-eighths inch seam is allowed, baste the
    shorter side at three-sixteenths of an inch, with the wider edge extending
    twice this width beyond.</p>
  <p>Turn over the wide side until its raw edge just meets the edge of the narrow
    side. Then bring the fold of the wide side to the basting line and stitch
    flat through the three thicknesses of material, finishing the seam with one
    stitching. After one becomes experienced, this seam can be held in place
    with a few pins and the edge turned over as the seam is stitched. This finish
    is made quickly and is very satisfactory for non-fitting garments.</p>
  <h4>    Sheer fabrics </h4>
  <p>This same finish can be used on sheer dresses <strong>after</strong> the dress has been stitched
    and finished. One side of the seam is trimmed back and the wider side is
    then rolled over the narrow side and either slip stitched or held with a
    running stitch.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/02_cross.jpg" alt="using a crossed-over stitch to form a hem" width="120" height="67" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Cross stitch</h4>
  <p>A cross stitch is sometimes used. Start at the left with a straight stitch.
    Take one stitch above the seam and the next stitch below the seam, gradually
    working to the right. This will overlap the stitches and hold the edge in
    place. This stitch is sometimes used on parts of the coat lining or on velvet.</p>
  <p>There are many other stitches seldom used in making dresses and can be found
    in all sewing books. As lessons in this course are to explain the dress construction,
    these superfluous stitches will be omitted.</p>
  <p>Practice each stitch if new.</p>

  <h3>    <b><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="right" id="right"></a></font></i></b>RIGHT-SIDE BASTING</h3>
  <h4> Intricate seams </h4>
  <p>Exclusive dressmakers and Parisian modistes make their dresses with many
    intricate seams which adds both smartness and value to the garment. As intricate
    seams are often difficult for the amateur to make by stitching from the inside
    unless she is properly instructed, instructions are often given with the
    pattern for flat stitching the seams, which is easier but is often impractical.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/02_flat.jpg" alt="skirt yoke attached with flat stitching" width="104" height="173" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Flat stitching</h4>
<p>Flat stitching, or stitching the seam from the right side, often gives a &quot;home
    made&quot; effect to a dress unless it is of the tailored type. In this type
    flat stitching is advisable, but the softer line dresses should be stitched
    from the inside only.</p>
  <p>Even though the dress is of the flat-stitched type the seam should also
    be stitched on the inside before turning the dress to stitch from the right
    side. If a well-made dress is examined, this will be found to be true, therefore,
    it is necessary to learn to stitch intricate seams from the inside to be
    able to make them as they should be made with double stitching.</p>
  <h4>    Stitch close
to the seam </h4>
  <p>If flat stitching is to be used, it should be made very close to the seam,
    stitching through three thicknesses of material, as the seam is all pressed
    to one side. It is only the heavy, tailored coats that have the flat stitching
    placed away from the seam, all dress stitching should be made very close
    to the seam; the thinner the material the closer to the seam the stitching
    is placed.</p>
  <h4>    Right-side
basting </h4>
  <p>To be able to make these intricate seams perfectly it is often necessary
    to baste the seam from the right side to secure the desired effect. This
    is called right-side basting.</p>
  <h4>    When used </h4>
  <p>Right-side basting is very helpful when basting curves, angles, applied
    facings, converging lines, stripes, plaids and alteration lines. It is possible
    to see the finished effect while the basting progresses, as the seam will
    lie flat. Much of the beauty of a striped or plaid dress is in the perfect
    matching of the converging lines and this can be easily accomplished with
    right-side basting.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/02_prepare.jpg" alt="triangle-shaped inset in bottom of bodice with seams pressed and basted" width="132" height="169" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Prepare seams</h4>
  <p>It is necessary to prepare the seams when basting from the right side as
    the one edge will be applied to the matching flat edge of the seam on the
    under side. One edge must be folded under, pressed, or basted before it is
    applied. All inner points must be clipped to permit the seam to be pressed
    back, and all curves, especially of loosely woven material, should be machine
    stitched around the raw edge before the seam is turned back. The edge is
    then basted back and pressed flat before it is applied.</p>
  <h4>    Yokes </h4>
  <p>If the section to be applied is a yoke, then press back the seam of the
    yoke as all yokes are applied to the garment rather than the garment being
    applied to the yoke. This also applies to flat stitching.</p>
  <h4>    Pin to place </h4>
  <p>Baste flat; pin the prepared section to the matching seam exactly as it
    should be made in the finished garment. Pin the prepared seam on <strong>top</strong> of the
    matching edge of the seam, placing the pins close together so that the material
    can be picked up in the hands if necessary, <strong>after</strong> it has been matched and
    pinned to place.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/02_slip.jpg" alt="triangle-shaped inset pinned, pressed, and basted, with sewing in progress, pins still in place along part of seam" width="132" height="112" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Slip stitched
to place</h4>
  <p>Baste the seam flat on the table if possible. This can be done if the seam
    is long, if curved it must be held in the hands. Take one stitch on the under
    section and draw out the thread, then slide the needle into the fold of the
    pressed edge and on the same needle that holds this stitch, catch a thread
    of the under section and draw out the thread only a short space. Repeat for
    three stitches before the long thread is pulled through. The needle catching
    both the top and bottom material on one stitch prevents the material from
    sliding out of position. The long stitch is taken in the fold of the pressed
    edge and the short stitch taken in the lower edge of the seam. This is slip
    stitching the pressed edge to the matching section.</p>
  <h4>    Press well </h4>
  <p>After the seam is basted, press well so that all mistakes will be corrected
    in the pressing and the material will lie flat. This will make a true line
    in a crease to follow on the under side. Lift the seam on the wrong side
    and <strong>stitch on the crease</strong>. Press after stitching on the wrong side before
    stitching on the right side later.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/02_inner.jpg" alt="inner point with stay across corner, seam turned and pressed" width="110" height="104" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Inner angles</h4>
  <p>If the material is loosely woven, as in coatings, the inner points will
    fray and should be stayed across the point.</p>
  <p>Clip the inner point to within two or three threads of the sewing line and
    press back the edges. Stretch out the corner to a straight line and across
    this straight line flat stitch a selvage of the goods, placing the selvage
    on the right side of the goods and stitch it flat. The seam on the cut edge
    must be very narrow at the ends and diminish to three threads at the point.
    When this point is pressed back, the point will not fray. The seam can then
    be applied to the matching edge.</p>
  <h4>    Corners </h4>
  <p>When stitching corners, stitch to the point; lower the needle into the goods;
    raise the presser foot of the machine, and swing the goods around the needle,
    using it for a pivot. When the new line for stitching is in place, lower
    the needle bar and continue to stitch. This will stitch a corner to a true
    point.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/02_acute.jpg" alt="triangle with corners folded, trimmed, and pressed" width="132" height="155" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Acute angles</h4>
  <p>If an acute angle is to be joined, it is advisable to apply the wider section
    of the joining seam. If it is to be flat stitched, the seam can be pressed
    over to the opposite side later. If it is to be applied as in an applied
    facing, then the point must be carefully prepared before basting.</p>
  <p>Press back the edges of the angle. Turn up the material across the point.
    Then trim off the surplus seam allowance both at the point and on the sides
    of the seams at the point. This will finish the point and prevent the threads
    from protruding beyond the edge of the finished seam. It will than be pinned
    and basted to place.</p>
  <h4>    Shaped facings </h4>
  <p>All shaped facings used as a trimming must be basted from the right side
    to secure the best results, even if they are to be flat stitched later. There
    should be no puckers in the facing and it should lie flat. The best results
    can be secured if the raw edge is machine stitched before turning back the
    edge. Press flat before applying it to the garment.</p>

  <h3>    <b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="assembling" id="assembling"></a></font></b>ASSEMBLING THE DRESS</h3>
  <h4>    Group the
    sections </h4>
  <p>Lay aside the sections of the garment as they are cut, placing all the back
    sections together and all the front sections together, both waist and skirt.
    Place all the sleeve sections together and separate all the trimming sections.
    The patterns should remain on all cut sections until the material is basted.</p>
  <h4>    Special pieces </h4>
  <p>If a special section of material is to be reserved for some purpose, fold
    it up and place a pin in it for identification later, otherwise it may be
    cut up for bindings.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/02_lines.jpg" alt="back with sewing lines marked across shoulder seams and neck" width="110" height="105" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Mark sewing
lines</h4>
  <p>The sewing lines will be marked after all the dress is cut. All inner points
    will be clipped to within a few threads of the sewing line so that they can
    be folded back at the sewing line. If the material can be creased with the
    iron, it is advisable to crease mark all the sewing lines as directed in
    the <a href="#marking">lesson on marking</a>. Mark all tucks, darts, pleats, center fronts, and
    center backs, all folds and all intricate seams such as points. If these
    lines cannot be creased they should be marked with chalk, tailor's tacks,
    or dressmaker's tacks. All these lines must be made perfect.</p>
  <h4>    Bound
buttonholes </h4>
  <p>If there are to be bound buttonholes in the dress they should be made before
    the dress is assembled, unless the garment will require extreme alterations,
    but as practically all the alteration will be made on the side seams and
    shoulders, this will affect the center section but little.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/02_tucks.jpg" alt="bodice front with collar and neckline notches, undearm dart, and tuck marked along center front" width="118" height="174" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Tucks&#8212;darts&#8212;yokes</h4>
  <p>Carefully baste all darts, pinning the darts so they will be made to match;
    baste all tucks; make any sheering or gathers and attach the front section
    to any possible yoke effect in the front only. If the yoke is curved (see
    rules for right-side basting to perfect it) match all notches when basting.
    Baste the front of the waist complete and press all the seams over to one
    side on the wrong side of the goods and stitch on the crease. This will perfect
    all the lines for stitching and will give a pleasing effect to the work.
    It is far more thrilling to sew when each section develops perfectly.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">Double <img src="images/02_pleated.jpg" alt="skirt with center front piecings, with pins to match pieces along seam lines" width="85" height="187" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />fr<img src="images/02_double_front.jpg" alt="bodice with center front line marked, and diagonal line from right shoulder at neck edge to bottom left at side seam" width="126" height="149" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />ont</h4>
  <p>If the front overlaps by being made in two sections, then the sections should
    be basted together down the center before the skirt is basted to it. The
    front is made complete and the back complete and the two are then joined
    together. If the front has bound buttonholes, these should be made and the
  facing applied before the two sections are basted down the center.</p>
  <p>Assemble the front of the skirt complete with pins, matching all long sections
    flat on the table. Match any two right and left pieces to the matching seams
    of another section and pin to place immediately. Then pin the seam even,
    and baste.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/02_bias.jpg" alt="left half of bodice front with box pleat running from yoke to bottom edge" width="95" height="165" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Pleated sections</h4>
  <p>If there is a pleated section in the front or a center box pleat, this should
    be made complete while the skirt is still in one section and not joined to
    the dress. Finish the pleats complete and press flat. If there are any intricate
    seams such as pointed yokes, or inset pleats, it may be advisable to set
    them in from the right side. (See rules for right-side basting.)</p>
  <h4 class="clear">Bias on top</h4>
  <p>When<img src="images/02_bias_top_waist.jpg" alt="front waist attached to a bodice which has two box pleats" width="118" height="214" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /> basting, <img src="images/02_bias_top.jpg" alt="skirt piece laid along fabric with bias marked" width="132" height="92" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />place all bias sections on top for basting and the straighter
    section on the bottom. Smooth the bias section along the straight threads
    of the goods so the edge will be perfect for basting. Pin to position before
    basting. When working with sheer fabric cut on the bias, it is sometimes
    advisable to baste the seam to tissue paper to hold it firm for stitching.</p>
  <p>All back sections will be handled in like manner, basting all tucks and
    darts, making any pleated sections necessary and pressing flat before joining
    to the waist.</p>
  <p>The front of the waist is now basted to the front of the skirt, matching
    the centers perfectly. The back is then basted, matching the center of the
    waist to the center of the skirt and pinning from the center to the side
    seams. This is also done on the front. The waist line is usually not changed;
    the fitting is done elsewhere. (See rules for fitting.)</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/02_basting_b.jpg" alt="seam made with dressmaker's basting stitch" width="132" height="83" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Basting</h4>
  <p>Use the dressmaker's basting on all long seams, as it is quicker and holds
    the material firmly in place with fewer stitches. Use fine soft thread for
    basting. The stiff, heavy thread is more difficult to use and it knots easily.
    Do not use a long needle for basting. If the thread knots, see <a href="#practical">lesson
    on stitches</a>.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/02_prepare_seams.jpg" alt="scalloped seam, basted, clipped, pressed, and pinned into place" width="132" height="165" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Prepare seams</h4>
  <p>All intricate seams such as points and curves should be prepared before
    basting. (See <a href="#points">lesson on points and angles</a>.) If the joining seam is a decided
    curve, machine stitch the raw edge below the sewing line and toward the raw
    edge. This stitching will hold the curve in shape but should not be visible
    when finished.</p>
  <p>When the seam is quite unruly when basted from the wrong side, turn it to
    the right side, fold under the edge, pin to the correct position and baste
    it from the right side with a slip stitch. (See rules for right-side basting.)
    This will perfect the most difficult seam.</p>
  <h4>    Flat stitching </h4>
  <p>If the seam is to be flat stitched, it should first be stitched from the
    wrong side before stitching from the right side. The first stitching will
    make the seam more firm and will make a flatter line for the final stitching.
    The seam must be pressed after the first stitching. This pressing will eliminate
    any pouching and bulging in the seam and will give a perfect edge to follow
    for stitching.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/02_yokes.jpg" alt="bodice with angled yoke and skirt with matching angled hip yoke" width="76" height="210" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Yokes</h4>
  <p>When the dress is the type to be flat stitched, the yoke is flat stitched
    to the skirt and to the waist rather than the waist flat stitched to the
    yoke. The yoke overlaps the other sections. The seam is then pressed <strong>under</strong>    the yoke to form the perfect edge for stitching and the final stitching is
    made through the three thicknesses of material, both edges of the seam and
    the yoke. The seam is not pressed open unless the seam is flat stitched on
    both sides of the seam.</p>
  <h4>    When to flat
stitch </h4>
  <p>All flat stitching should be done before the side seams are joined as it
    is very difficult to flat stitch perfectly with the whole dress bundled under
    the arm of the machine. The tension should not be too tight, as the stitch
    is taken through three thicknesses of material.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/02_side-seams.jpg" alt="marking the place along the side seam where the bodice yoke, waistline, and hip yoke should all join" width="132" height="202" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Side seams</h4>
  <p>The front has now been basted complete and the back complete, and they have
    been joined at the waist line. The side seams are now basted. Lay the dress
    flat on the table and carefully match all intersecting lines at the side
    seams. This applies to the waist line and any possible yoke lines extending
    into the side seam. They must match perfectly on the right side. It may be
    necessary to turn the seam back on one side when pinning to place to see
    the sewing line of the matching side. Leave the left side open at the waist
    line for the placket when stitching but it should be basted shut and press
    marked on the sewing line.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/02_sleeves.jpg" alt="one-piece sleve with wrist detail" width="73" height="139" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Sleeves</h4>
  <p>The sleeves are set in last but should be set into the dress before it is
    tried on. Baste all the sleeve sections together, matching the sleeve seams
    when the pattern is removed from the sleeve material. Overlap each sleeve
    to the opposite side and pin so that they will not be made for the same arm.</p>
  <p>Make the darts; baste on any possible insets, and make it as near complete
    as possible with the basting. The effect is nearer perfect and the fitting
    will be easier.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/02_shoulder.jpg" alt="bodice front joined to bodice back at shoulder, with dotted line marking centers and bottom back" width="101" height="167" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Saddle shoulders </h4>
  <p>Saddle shoulders and all sleeves extending into the neck will be basted
    into the dress to join the shoulders. The set-in sleeve will be basted <strong>after</strong>    the shoulder seam is joined.</p>
<p>The shoulder seam is always basted with the back of the dress uppermost
    as the back seam is usually a trifle longer than the front shoulder seam
    due to the curve of the shoulders. The fuller portion of any material is
    held uppermost for basting. Pin both ends of the seam at the sewing line
    and it will be immaterial whether the basting is started from the neck or
    from the arm. The back must be uppermost with the small part of the seam
    held on top.</p>
  <h4>    Stay the
armhole </h4>
  <p>If the dress is to be tried on without a sleeve it is advisable to machine
    stitch around the curve of the arm before it is tried on as the curve will
    stretch and the sleeve will then not fit.</p>
  <h4>    Collar </h4>
  <p>It is not necessary to baste on the collar for the first fitting unless
    so desired. The neck often must be changed in fitting, which will alter the
    neck curve.</p>
  <h4>    Hem </h4>
  <p>Baste in the trial hem. The dress will have a much more pleasing appearance.
    This will require but a few minutes.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/02_stitching.jpg" alt="uneven stitching showing along pressed seam (yes, this is the same illustration as previously used in this chapter, but that's what the book has done!)" width="132" height="166" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Stitching</h4>
  <p>Be sure to press all seams over to one side to mark for a perfect stitching
    line before stitching the dress after it is fitted. This is even more important
    than marking the sewing lines with a crease. This pressing will bring out
    all mistakes in basting and will give the perfect line for the last stitching.
    The side seams will curve from the waist to the hips and cannot be pressed
    flat. They can be gradually drawn over the end of the ironing board while
    pressing and thus retain the curved line.</p>
  <h4>    Seam stay </h4>
  <p>If the side seam is very narrow or if there will be a great strain upon
    it on thin material, it is advisable to stitch a narrow selvage of the goods
    into the seam as a stay.</p>
  <h4>    Use good thread </h4>
  <p>Stitch with good thread. The best is none too good. After spending many
    hours making a garment, it is discouraging to have it burst out in the seam
    at the first wearing or to find the thread fading. Match the dominant color
    of the material on figured fabrics, usually the background. Also, select
    thread a shade darker than the material as the sheen of the thread makes
    it appear lighter. Grey thread is an excellent substitute color for many
    colors. Keep both light and dark grey thread in the sewing box for emergency.</p>

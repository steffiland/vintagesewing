<h3><font
			face="Arial"><b><em><a name="analyzed" id="analyzed"></a></em></b></font>Fitting Analyzed</h3>
  <h4>Fitting is a problem </h4>
  <p>Fitting is a problem that confronts the tailor and the dressmaker, the ready-to-wear
    garments, and the home sewer. The various curves of the women's figure complicate
    the problem and make the closely fitting garment even more difficult to adjust
    to the individual than the garment with straight lines.</p>
  <h4>    Older women are difficult to fit </h4>
  <p>Commercial patterns are made according to a basis of standard measurements
    that are more normal in youthful figures and as the variation from standard
    measurements often does not develop until later years, older women are more
    difficult to fit. Women of the stouter type accumulate an excess of flesh
    disproportionally. Some develop muscular or fleshy arms and remain small
    through the bust, while others of the same bust size may have very small
    arms and wide shoulders. Some develop large busts and retain the narrow shoulders,
    while others remain small in the bust but expand in the hips. These represent
    some of the variations from the standard measurements that make fitting especially
    difficult for the stout woman.</p>
  <h4>    Figures differ </h4>
  <p>The standard figure is a fiction reached through striking an average after
    various measurements, and the individual who conforms to these measurements
    is fortunate. In actual life the individual inherits a certain boxy structure
    which determines the breadth of her shoulders, and the length of her arms
    and body. An unusual bony structure may require standard pattern alterations,
    but these alterations may not cover unusual proportions developed through
    an accumulation of extra flesh through the lower shoulders, arms, bust, or
    hips.</p>
  <h4>    Fitting is important </h4>
  <p>Fitting is <strong>all</strong> important; style, fabric, color, and workmanship, all contribute
    to the smartness of the garment, but no garment is smart that does not fit
    the individual who wears it. The experienced sewer often becomes so discouraged
    with attempting to solve her own fitting problems that though she may desire
    to do her own sewing, she resorts through desperation to the ready-to-wear
    departments where fitters are employed to solve her problems.</p>
  <h4>    Fitting a snare and delusion </h4>
  <p>Fitting is often a snare and a delusion. The delusion arises when the dress
    is tried on, for the dress may settle down around the shoulders and neck
    and appear to fit on the shoulders, but may bulge and draw elsewhere. The
    snare develops in attempting to eliminate the bulges and drawings and to
    fit the dress correctly.</p>
  <h4>    Fitting deceptive </h4>
  <p>The law of gravity has been responsible for the dress resting smoothly on
    the shoulders, but do not assume that a dress fits merely because it rests
    smoothly around the neck. Neck fitting is of minor consideration compared
    to that of the shoulders, back, armholes, front, hips, and sleeves.</p>
  <h4>    Looseness differs </h4>
  <p>Dresses are not all designed to fit with the same degree of looseness. Those
    designed to fit loosely should not be fitted too closely or the designed
    effect will be sacrificed. If, however, the dress does not produce the desired
    effect it may then be changed.</p>
  <h4>    Illustrations explain type </h4>
  <p>The type of fitting will be evident in the pattern illustration. If the
    dress has been designed on loose lines, around the sleeves and arm holes,
    there will be folds in evidence on the illustration. If smooth lines have
    been designed, the illustration will have no folds. If the picture indicates
    smooth lines, the dress should be equally as smooth. And if it indicates
    looseness, the dress should fit equally as loose.</p>
  <h4>    Some dresses fit tighter </h4>
  <p>Dresses of various types are also designed to fit with a varying degree
    of looseness. House dresses are made on looser lines than afternoon frocks,
    and evening gowns are fitted more closely than all other dresses. Dresses
    with close fitted sleeve lines cannot be fitted as snugly as sleeveless dresses,
    and heavy crepes and woolens can be fitted much more closely than sheer fabrics.</p>
  <h4>    Fitting varies </h4>
  <p>The woman of normal proportions can fit her dresses closely, but the disproportionate
    woman must be cautious. The figure with the hollow chest should provide more
    fullness through the bust and chest than the normal figure of the same bust
    size. The woman with large hips should try to emphasize the bust in order
    to minimize the hips. The woman with a prominent abdomen should fit the hips
    more loosely than the normal figure in order to minimize the prominence of
    the abdomen. The fleshy woman often makes the mistake of being fitted too
    closely in her dresses and so presents an inflated appearance. The heavy
    bust lifts in the corseted figure when seated and if the dress or coat is
    fitted closely when standing it may be too tight when seated. Therefore,
    the stout woman should test the fitting of her dress in a sitting position.</p>
  <h4>    Comfort, correct lines </h4>
  <p>It is often difficult to judge the correct fitting of a dress by the appearance
    only. The dress may <strong>appear</strong> to be perfectly fitted as to the correct placement
    of lines and the correct thread of materials and yet may be most uncomfortable.</p>
  <h4>    No strain or bulges </h4>
  <p>A dress does not fit perfectly unless it falls into correct lines without
    <strong>constant adjustment</strong>, and is perfectly comfortable when the wearer is in motion.
    The wearer should be unconscious of any strain or bulges in the dress, and
    it should not burst out in the seams under ordinary strain.</p>
  <h4>    Smoothness </h4>
  <p>The dress should fit smooth down the back and down the front, and in a dress
    with a set-in sleeve, it should fit smooth around the arm. A fitted dress
    should have no pouches and excess material at the waist line or through the
    shoulders and sleeves. It should fit sufficiently loose that the wearer can
    move without the movement causing a strained appearance in the dress, and
    so that she can remove it without splitting the material or bursting the
    seams.</p>
  <p>    No diagonal wrinkles There should be no diagonal wrinkles or crosswise pouches
      in any part of the dress.</p>
  <p>The sleeves should be fitted to assure freedom of motion and the hips should
    fit closely but should not present a strained appearance.</p>
  <h4>    Lines must be changed </h4>
  <p>The lines of the figure cannot be changed to conform to the lines of the
    pattern, therefore, the lines of the pattern must be changed to conform to
    the figure. This change in the pattern often makes it necessary to determine
    the correct placement of a new shoulder line, neck line or a new armhole
    placement.</p>
  <p>If the figure is very short or very tall, the inner lines such as the yoke
    lines of the design must necessarily be lifted or lowered to retain the style
    lines of the pattern, and to make the dress becoming to the individual type
    of figure.</p>
  <h4>    Set-in sleeves </h4>
  <p>General rules will be given for fitting a plain dress with a set-in sleeve,
    but the rules must be adapted to the material, the type of dress, and the
    individual who is to wear the garment.</p>
  <h4>    Change shoulders </h4>
  <p>Although regular ready-made shoulder lines rest on top of the shoulder,
    custom-made garments are made with the shoulder lines one fourth inch back
    toward the back at the neck and one-half inch back of the top of the shoulder
    at the arm hole. It may be advisable even to change this rule to improve
    the lines of the figure.</p>
  <p>Round shoulders have a tendency to appear straighter if the shoulder line
    is moved further back, and the over-erect figures assume a more normal posture
    if the shoulder line is placed further to the front. This change will be
    made after the shoulder lines have been altered to fit these types of figures.</p>
  <h4>    Neck lines vary </h4>
  <p>Neck lines vary with the prevailing styles, but the back of the neck of
    tailored dresses, or dresses with collars, should rest well up to the bone
    at the back of the neck or on a line with a strand of beads.</p>
  <p>Neck lines that are cut low in the back often give an uncomfortable feeling
    as though the dress were sliding off the shoulders. In this case the neck
    line should be raised. A neck line that bulges in the back is too high and
    will require raising the back and shoulders.</p>
  <p>When making a pointed neck line in front, it is advisable to check the depth
    of the point as each woman has a becoming depth of the neck. Cut the neck
    a trifle too high and trim it out on the wearer if necessary.</p>
  <h4>    Sleeves vary </h4>
  <p>Placement of the armhole also depends upon the design of the dress. The
    pattern illustration will indicate extra folds down the side of the arm or
    body if the armhole is low or loose. The rules as given determine the placement
    of the armhole of a set-in sleeve. Variations in sleeve designs will vary
    the rule.</p>
  <h4>    Armhole size </h4>
  <p>The actual armhole measurement varies with the position of the arm. It will
    measure from one to two inches smaller with the arm raised than with the
    arm lowered. French sleeves are made to fit the extended arm, which gives
    a very small armhole and quite a straight sleeve cap. The commercial sleeve
    pattern is made for the lowered arm which gives a large armhole, which is
    necessary for average fitting of a wide variation in figures, as some figures
    have a low back armhole and some have a low front armhole. Making them both
    low produces a loose armhole but does not give a perfect fitting. Raising
    the armpit to fit the individual gives a more comfortable fitting.</p>
<h4>    Correct armhole placement</h4>
  <p> Correct placement of the individual armhole for a set-in sleeve will rest
    on the line of a string tied around the arm to the shoulder. Mark the line
    of
  the string.</p>
  <p>Have the customer clasp the hands in front when marking the back and clasp
    the hands in the back when marking the front. The underarm should rest within
    one-half inch of the pit of the arm when lowered.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/07_armhole.jpg" alt="bodice front with armhole clipped" width="81" height="129" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Armhole looseness</h4>
  <p>When the shoulders, chest, and cross-back are made wider or narrower, it
    will be necessary to change the line of the armhole. The armhole will also
    be changed when the size of the sleeve is changed. This change is frequent
    as there is a great variation in the size of arms. Mark the new armhole placement
    on the customer, but do not cut out the armhole until the dress is removed.
    Clip into the curves, placing the point of the scissors at the end of the
    point to be clipped and fold the edge of the seam back over the point of
    the scissors and cut the goods with the scissors in this position.</p>
  <p>If the armhole of a fitted sleeve seems too tight <strong>never</strong> cut the sleeve <strong>under</strong>    the arm but rather clip in the curve in <strong>front</strong> of the arm. One-quarter inch
    will relieve the strain. Do not hollow out an armhole to produce comfort.
    This often produces tragic results.</p>
<h4>    Various sleeves</h4>
  <p>Fashion changes the placement of the armhole. The drop shoulder places the
    armhole below the shoulder line and the short-shoulder places the armhole
    higher. The various styles of epaulet shoulders designed with the sleeve
    extending to the neck having a fitted underarm, the raglan sleeve with the
    <strong>loose</strong> underarm and the sleeve extending to the neck, the dolmen sleeve very
    loose under the arm, and the kimono sleeve cut in one with the body of the
    dress, all must be considered in fitting, and any changes in fitting will
    be made as directed later in these lessons.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/07_backs.jpg" alt="back pattern piece, with variations on shoulder slope, neck height, and width" width="101" height="168" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Different backs</h4>
  <p>Special stress is placed on the importance of fitting the upper part of
    the back of the waist as there are many variations of the fitting of this
    portion of the dress, each variation in figure requiring a change in the
    pattern. The wide shoulders and the narrow shoulders; the narrow upper back
    and the wide lower back; the sloping shoulders and the erect shoulders; the
    erect shoulders and the stooped shoulders and the fat shoulders; each are
    to be fitted to a figure with large arms and small arms, which also varies
    the armholes on each. Each type combined with the others makes a vast assortment
    of different backs that will require pattern alterations.</p>
  <p>Some patterns make provision for moderate letting out on the side and shoulder
    seams. When using these patterns be sure to note this extra allowance.</p>
<h3>    <strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="standard" id="standard"></a></font></strong>STANDARD MEASUREMENT COMPARISONS</h3>
  <h4>Patterns are made from standard measurements </h4>
  <p>The standard basis of measurements is averaged from a large number of women
    who all measure the same bust size. The measurements of the lengths of the
    body and arms, the widths of the cross-backs, shoulder slopes, and sizes
    of the arms may vary for individual figures, but an average size must be
    secured to produce a commercial pattern at a small price. Some manufacturers
    make patterns to fit figures of several different types short women, women
    with large hips, women with the juvenile type of figure, etc. By studying
    your figure and making your selection from patterns designed for your type,
    you will reduce the necessary adjustment or perhaps eliminate it entirely.</p>
  <h4>    Patterns differ </h4>
  <p>Even though the pattern manufacturers may agree on a certain proportion
    as to the comparative bust and hip size, each uses a different basic pattern
    for designing. Hence each pattern manufacturer fits a different type of figure.
    One make of pattern may fit a different type woman better than another make
    of pattern, not because the pattern is made on better fitting lines, but
    because the pattern fits her type of figure. On the other hand, the pattern
    which fits her may not fit her friends of the same bust size who is easily
    fitted in another make of pattern. It is not the pattern that is wrong, but
    the figure does not conform to the lines of the pattern. As it is impossible
    to alter the lines of the figure, the pattern <strong>must</strong> be altered to conform
    to the lines of the figure. The lines of the pattern must be altered if the
    dress does not fit.</p>
<h4>Do not hesitate to alter the pattern </h4>
  <p>Correctly fitted dresses, that do not bulge and draw, cover the peculiarities
    of the figure far better than dresses made with no alterations.</p>
  <h4>    Fitters alter dresses </h4>
  <p>Professional fitters in ready-to-wear departments do not hesitate to alter
    the lines of the <strong>dress</strong>, if it will improve it or if it will improve the effect
    of the dress on the customer. In fact the garment would often not be sold
    unless such an important alteration was made.</p>
  <h4>    Alter wisely </h4>
  <p>Pattern alterations are equally essential but must be made wisely and with
    the understanding of the subject of fitting. The alterations which will herein
    be described will not all be used on <strong>one</strong> pattern, nor will they all be used
    for <strong>one</strong> figure. There may possibly be in one figure only one or two variations
    from the standard pattern. The full category of fitting problems will be
    explained in these pages so that the reader can determine wherein the individual
    figure varies from the standard measurements and how to correct the pattern.</p>
<h4>    Narrow shoulders</h4>
  <p class="clear"><img src="images/07_narrow-a.jpg" alt="bodice pattern with stitching line marked at side and armhole" width="67" height="125" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Individual measurements may vary in the width of the shoulders; the figure
    with narrow shoulders will find the pattern so wide that the shoulder seam
    will be too long, the back too wide, and the front possibly too narrow. Altering
    these lines will change the armhole but it will be necessary for good fitting.</p>
  <p class="clear"><img src="images/07_narrow-b.jpg" alt="bodice pattern with stitching line marked at side and armhole" width="74" height="127" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Individuals with wide shoulders will find that the pattern is too narrow
    through the shoulders, cross back is too narrow, and the shoulder seams too
    short. The chest may also be too narrow and the front dart too wide.</p>
  <p class="clear"><img src="images/07_narrow-c.jpg" alt="bodice pattern with altered stitching line at neck and shoulder seams" width="72" height="125" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Figures with square shoulders have the arms set high on the body, which
    shortens the pattern above the armholes. The commercial pattern will be cut
    too low at the underarm and must be lifted the full width of the shoulder
    seam across the back.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    Sloping shoulders</h4>
  <p><img src="images/07_sloping.jpg" alt="bodice pattern with alteration marking raised neck and deeper shoulder slope" width="88" height="141" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Sloping shoulders also present difficulties in fitting and will require
    alterations in the pattern. Sloping shoulders place the arms so low on the
    body that the shoulder seam will have to be changed. This change often necessitates
    lengthening the back at the neck and then sloping the shoulder seam from
    this additional allowance made at the <strong>neck</strong> and shoulder seam, down to the
    correct line at the <strong>armhole</strong>. It is often necessary to let out the seam on
    the full length of the shoulder in the back, letting out more material at
    the neck of the shoulder seam than at the armhole. This alteration will lengthen
    the back and slope the shoulder seam as required.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/07_erect.jpg" alt="bodice patterns marked with riased back neck and shoulder, and lowered front neck and shoulder" width="132" height="129" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Erect posture</h4>
  <p>The woman with very erect posture may find that the pattern is too long
    in the back and too short in front from the waist line to the shoulders.
    Pattern alterations to fit this type of figure would not only lengthen the
    front section but would also change the placement of the shoulder seam as
    the pattern would be shortened in the back at the shoulders.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/07_stooped.jpg" alt="bodice pattern marked with lowered back neck and shoulder, and raised front shoulder" width="132" height="126" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Stooped shoulders</h4>
  <p>The individual with stooped or round shoulders must also alter the lines
    of the pattern often in a marked degree, depending upon the posture. The
    back of the figure will be quite curved, and it will be necessary to lengthen
    the pattern above the armhole after straightening the thread of material
    across the back, below the armpits. The pattern must also be altered in front
    for the stooped figure, as it will usually be too long from the armpits to
    the shoulders. This change will be made by <strong>lifting</strong> the shoulder seam at the
    neck.</p>
  <h4>    Arms vary </h4>
  <p>Variation in arm measurements compared to the standard sizes in sleeves
    presents a need to consider sleeve pattern alterations. Arms vary in size
    in as great a proportion as do the hips for different figures of the same
    bust size. The size of the arm will vary from one-half to three inches larger
    or smaller than the arm that is supposed to be fitted with the sleeve enclosed
    with the pattern. The small woman who may have an unusually large arm, or
    the large woman who may have a very small arm, must each be fitted not only
    through sleeve alterations but with armhole alterations also.</p>
  <h4>    Arms of one size vary </h4>
  <p>Fitting the upper arm does not solve all the fitting problem in sleeves,
    as arms of one size vary greatly in proportion. A pattern that fits the upper
    arm will not necessarily fit the lower arm, and this in addition to the variation
    in arm lengths, presents quite a problem in sleeve fitting.</p>
  <h4>    Underarm seams meet </h4>
  <p>Modern sleeves are set into the armhole with the underarm seam of the sleeve
    meeting the underarm seam of the dress. Two-piece coat sleeves and intricately
    cut patterns may not conform to this rule, but when a pattern is used, the
    notches should be followed for correct placement.</p>
  <h4>    Fullness at the elbow </h4>
  <p>The fullness that is placed at the back of the arm at the elbow in closely
    fitted sleeves is necessary for comfort when the arm is bent and also keeps
    the sleeve from twisting. The arm that is quite large at the lower arm in
    comparison to the size of the upper arm will need a greater fullness in the
    elbow of the sleeve; but the arm that is quite large in the upper arm and
    very small in the lower arm will require very little elbow fullness.</p>
  <h4>    Skirt fitting closely related to waist fitting </h4>
  <p>Skirts that are attached to waists in the dress should be fitted in one
    unit with the waist. There should be no change in fitting at the waist line
    unless for a woman with a large abdomen. Therefore, the waist and skirt should
    be joined together before fitting. There will be little change in the skirt
    other than in the hips. The dress will be anchored at the waist and the greater
    part of the fitting will be <strong>above the waist line</strong>.</p>
  <h4>    Rules for a plain dress </h4>
  <p>The fitting rules given will apply to a plain dress with the natural waist
    line fitted. The skirt will be closely fitted at the hips and the dress will
    have a set-in sleeve, fitted to the wrist. The fitting of all other styles
    will be based on the fitting of a plain dress.</p>
  <h4>    Make first dress of checked gingham </h4>
  <p>The rules for fitting could be more clearly demonstrated if the first dress
    was made of checked gingham. The crosswise and lengthwise threads are very
    prominent in this material and will be easily followed and straightened as
    directed. The dress could be used as a guide for future fitting, carefully
    marking all alterations that were made.</p>
  <h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em><strong><a name="size" id="size"></a></strong></em></font>Size of Pattern to Select</h3>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/07_bust-size.jpg" alt="front and back bodice pattern, side seam abutted, with line across bust line" width="132" height="117" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Select the bust size</h4>
  <p>Patterns are usually selected according to the bust size, as skirt alterations
    are easy to make. The majority of skirts can be altered easily on the side
    seams by making an extra seam allowance or by taking in the seam and it will
    not affect the style of the dress. But if the underarm seams of the waist
    are taken up or let out, the armhole will also be altered in the same degree
    and complications may develop that are difficult for the home sewer to solve.
    This makes it advisable to select the correct bust size and alter the hips.</p>
  <p>Skirt patterns with the side seams so designed that the seams of the skirt
    do not meet the underarm seams of the waist, often produce a complication
    in fitting if the hip pattern is found to be too large. A complicated skirt
    design should therefore be purchased according to the hip size and should
    be altered at the waist.</p>
  <h4>    Very large hips and small bust require thought </h4>
  <p>The woman with unusually large hips in proportion to the bust size will
    encounter less difficulty in general if she selects a pattern between the
    bust and hip size; that is a pattern a trifle larger than the bust and a
    little smaller than the hips. The alterations that will then be made will
    not radically change the lines of the pattern only on the side seams and
    will be easier fitted. The hips will be made larger and the bust smaller.</p>
  <h4>    Figures with larger bust than hips select bust size </h4>
  <p>If the figure is larger in the bust than in the hips in relation to the
    pattern, it is always advisable to select a pattern the size of the bust
    and take in the hips. The hip lines are altered with less difficulty and
    the inner waist lines are retained.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    Two crossbacks</h4>
  <p><img src="images/07_crossbacks-a.jpg" alt="back pattern pieces with arrows marking from top of armhole to center back, and from bottom of armhole to center back, with alteration marks altering armhole and side seams" width="132" height="109" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />There are two crossbacks, and they both vary greatly from the standard pattern.
    One is straight across the shoulders at the top of the arm and the other
    is four inches lower. The lower one will sometimes be as much as three inches
    wider than the upper measurement. Tucks can be taken in the back of the neck
    to fit the curve or the armhole can be sloped.</p>
  <p class="clear"><img src="images/07_crossbacks-b.jpg" alt="back pattern pieces with arrows marking from top of armhole to center back, and from bottom of armhole to center back, with alteration marks altering armhole and side seams" width="132" height="157" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Straighten the altered side seams by drawing a straight line from the hip
    to the bottom of the skirt on the seam. Circular skirts will be altered in
    like manner but will require straightening on the side seams more than a
    skirt of straighter lines.</p>
  <h3 class="clear">Fit the Lines of the Body</h3>
<h4>Fitting curves</h4>
  <p class="clear"><img src="images/07_fitting-curves.jpg" alt="bodice and skirt pattern, with line adjusting the side seam curve" width="132" height="164" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />The correct method of fitting conforms to the curves of the woman's figure,
    often fitting at the natural waist. The rules can be modified to conform
    to the changes in fashion or to individual taste as to looseness or tightness
    of the garment, but these rules will be governed by the amount of alteration
    made at the underarm seams, for these seams control the looseness or tightness
    of the dress.</p>
  <p>Definite rules will be given for the elimination of any pouches, puckers,
    or drawings in a dress and should be followed as given. Following these rules
    straightens the thread of material on a garment, thus making it comfortable
    whether the dress is loose or tight fitting.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    Spreading the pattern cannot fit curves</h4>
  <p><img src="images/07_spreading.jpg" alt="bodice pattern split from neck edge at shoulder seam straight down to bottom, spread to adjust circumference; bodice pattern with tuck taken at shoulder seam to alter the circumference" width="132" height="162" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />The conventional method of fitting the figure by splitting and spreading
    the pattern will be used only to lengthen certain sections but cannot be
    employed for fitting the curves of the figure or for fitting posture. This
    method of pattern alteration may accomplish the purpose of &quot;not altering
    the lines of the pattern&quot; but does not produce the result desired by
    the customer, namely: &quot;fitting her figure&quot; and making the dress
    comfortable.</p>
  <p>When the pattern is split lengthwise and spread crosswise to enlarge any
    one of its crosswise measurements, the spreading not only enlarges the measurement
    desired, but also enlarges every other crosswise measurement on that pattern
    section.</p>
  <p>For example: If the back of the waist is split and spread from the waist
    line to the shoulder seam to enlarge the crossback, the crossback is not
    only enlarged, but the bust and waist measurements are also enlarged to a
    much greater degree.</p>
  <p>If the waist is not cut in one with the skirt, the waist line of the bodice
    will be enlarged to such an extent that it will be much too large to match
    the notches of the waist line of the skirt.</p>
  <p>Small darts cannot be satisfactorily taken in the shoulder seams to shorten
    them, as the pattern will not lie flat and it will narrow the crossback.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/07_enlarged.jpg" alt="dress split from edge of neck at shoulder seam down to hem, spread to enlarge" width="103" height="185" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />All measurements are enlarged</h4>
  <p>The same complication will be found even to a greater degree when a full
    length pattern is split and spread from the hem line to the shoulders to
    enlarge the hips. This enlargement will not only enlarge the hips but will
    also enlarge all other crosswise measurements, including the upper and lower
    crossback, bust line, waist line, and the lower edge of the skirt.</p>
  <p>It is not necessary to enlarge the whole pattern to be able to enlarge one
    measurement. The correct alteration will also produce much better results.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/07_fit-side.jpg" alt="bodice top and bottom with stitching lines along side and armhole enlarged" width="69" height="197" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Fit at the side seams</h4>
  <p>Patterns should be altered only on the measurements that require changing.
    All alterations except those in length should be made on the side and shoulder
    seams. The length of a pattern should be tested and adjustment made, if necessary,
    before the fabric is cut. If your pattern does not provide sufficient width
    of seam for letting out the garment, it will be wise to make an additional
    seam allowance on the sides, armholes, shoulders and neck, and then mark
    the sewing line by pressing the seams over the pattern as previously described.
    This will give a perfect line to follow in letting out or taking in from
    the original basting.</p>

  <p class="clear"><img src="images/07_meas-1.jpg" alt="string tied around chest at underarm level" width="132" height="178" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Accurate
    measurements of the body can be secured only with the dress removed, unless
    the dress
    is pinned closely around the armholes. The depth of the
    armhole in the back is very important for comfortable fitting and this measurement
    can be secured only from a straight line across the back from one armpit
  to the other, and not from the armhole of the dress. (1)</p>
  <p class="clear"><img src="images/07_meas-2.jpg" alt="string tied around chest, over top of bust and under arm" width="110" height="207" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />This measurement can be secured accurately if a string is tied across the
    chest and across the back well up to the armpits. The string must be straight
    across the back; it will also extend across the chest in front. (See directions
    for measurements.) It can be termed a chest tape. (2)</p>
  <p class="clear"><img src="images/07_meas-3.jpg" alt="string tied around arms to find armhole placement" width="132" height="207" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />The two crossbacks are also important and should be taken with the dress
    removed, as many dresses have incorrect armhole lines. A string can be tied
    around each arm to secure the exact line if so desired (3). A pencil mark
    can be made on the flesh, following the string.</p>
  <p>A pencil mark should also be made on the body on the bone at the back of
    the neck, as there are several measurements taken from this point. The back
    length; armhole depth; waist length in back, and waist length in front.</p>
  <p>The full length of the dress is taken only in the center back. All skirt
    alterations in length will be checked from the back alterations.</p>
  <p class="clear"><img src="images/07_meas-4-5.jpg" alt="measurement from nape of neck to hem, and measurement from nape of neck to waist" width="132" height="153" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Full length&#8212;taken
    from the bone at the center of the neck in the back
    to the hem line. (4)</p>
  <p>Waist back&#8212;taken from the bone at the center of the neck in the back
    to the waist line in the back. (5)</p>
  <p class="clear"><img src="images/07_meas-6.jpg" alt="from undearm to waist" width="98" height="217" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Underarm depth&#8212;from pit of arm to waist line. (6)</p>
  <p>  <img src="images/07_meas-7.jpg" alt="string tied around back" width="132" height="191" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Armhole depth&#8212;length from the bone at the center of the neck in the back
to the tape across the back and chest. (7)</p>
  <p class="clear"><img src="images/07_meas-8.jpg" alt="measure across back from tops of armhole, and across back from bottom of back armhole" width="132" height="186" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Upper crossback (see illustration, first page). Measure straight across
    the back from shoulder to shoulder. Measure from the top of the shoulder
    bones which are plainly left. If marks have been made on the body from string
    lines around each arm, then measure from these lines. The tape will be about
    two inches below the neck line in the center back. (8)</p>
  <p>Lower crossback&#8212;four inches below the shoulders. Measurement is taken
    with the hands crossed in front. If pencil mark has been made on the body
    from the string line around the armholes, then measure across the back between
    the lines. If the line was not made, feel where the arm curve begins and
    measure from this point. (8)</p>
  <p>The well-fitted armhole in the back eliminates much of the discomfort of
    the dress and will prevent sleeves from bursting out in the back.</p>
  <p>Individual figures vary greatly in this measurement and each should be checked
    for perfect fitting and comfort.</p>
  <p class="clear">Waist front&#8212;measure from the center of <img src="images/07_meas-10.jpg" alt="measurement around chest, across back" width="114" height="215" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />the<img src="images/07_meas-9.jpg" alt="measurement from nape of neck, down over bust, down to waist" width="99" height="212" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /> back of the neck, over
    the shoulder, down over the bust and straight to the waist under the bust
    and <strong>not</strong> to the center front. (9)</p>
  <p>Bust&#8212;tape slopes upward in the back. Stand back of the customer. Place
    the right hand on the 15-inch mark, reach under the customer's arms and catch
    the tape at the 15-inch mark with the other hand. Then place the tape on
    the bust and then <strong>slide the fingers along the tape</strong> to the back. This will
    prevent the tape from slipping off the full part of the bust. Lift the tape
    upward to within two inches of the underarm and take the measurement easy.
    Add from two to four inches to this measurement: two inches for large figure,
    four inches for small, flat figure. (10)</p>
  <p>Errors&#8212;a low-swung bust measurement as taken by one's self gives a
    brassiere measurement and will be too tight for a dress.</p>
  <p>Waist line&#8212;measure the waist line loosely where the belt will be worn.
    Add one inch. (9)</p>
  <p class="clear"><img src="images/07_meas-11.jpg" alt="hip measurement" width="91" height="203" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Hips&#8212;measure
    eight inches below the waist line, loosely. Add one inch for loose fitting.
    (11)</p>
  <p class="clear"><img src="images/07_meas-12.jpg" alt="measurement around both thighs" width="100" height="207" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Thighs&#8212;measure four inches below the hips loosely. Add one inch. (12)</p>

  <h3 class="clear"><em><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="tissue" id="tissue"></a></font></strong></em>Fitting Tissue Pattern to Measurements</h3>
  <h4><img src="images/07_set-in.jpg" alt="pattern pieces pinned together, with alteration lines marked" width="132" height="203" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />The Set-in Sleeve</h4>
  <p>  Use a colored pencil to mark all altered lines on the pattern. All alterations
    on the pattern or on the garment should be made on the side seams and not
    on the joining seams of the sections of the design. The garment will be joined
    and then fitted as though the garment were cut in one section in the front
from neck to hem and in one section in the back.</p>
  <p>It is necessary to pin all the sections of the front of the pattern together
    and all the sections of the back together before fitting. The waist remains
    separate from the skirt when the pattern is fitted.</p>
  <p>The back is fitted first; pinning in any pleats, joining any yoke sections
    or overlapping any double-back sections.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/07_armhole-depth.jpg" alt="bodice with line from bottom edge of armhole to center back, folded along that line, to shorten waist if necessary" width="132" height="183" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Fit the armhole depth</h4>
  <p>The back pattern is now in one piece. Fold the back down at the underarm
    at the sewing line and not at the edge of the pattern, keeping the center
    back lines together. Measure the depth of the upper part of the back pattern
    from the neck to the folded edge. (7)</p>
  <p>If the pattern is too long from the neck to armpit, fold a tuck through
    the pattern across the back to shorten it to the desired length.</p>
  <p>If the pattern is too short, split the pattern across the back and set in
    a piece of paper so as to make the pattern the necessary length.</p>
  <p class="clear"><img src="images/07_depth-b.jpg" alt="armhole altered by taking tuck or splitting and lengthening from center of armhole curve to center back" width="132" height="153" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />For example: If the individual measures seven and one-half inches and the
    pattern measures eight and one-half inches, then take up a half-inch tuck
    across the back of the pattern from center back to armhole. This will shorten
    the upper back one inch.</p>
  <p>If the individual measures nine and one-half inches and the pattern measures
    eight and one half inches, split the upper back pattern from center back
    to armpit and set in a one-inch strip to give it the extra length.</p>
  <p class="clear"><img src="images/07_depth-c.jpg" alt="shoulder slope altered in addition to tuck or split to alter armhole depth" width="132" height="136" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Square shoulders usually require shortening the top of the pattern from
    the armpit to the neck. It can be shortened by taking up a fold or tuck in
    the pattern between the back and the armhole or by pencil-marking a new neck
    and shoulder. An extra inch should be allowed on the shoulder seam at the
    armhole to be able to make the shoulder seam straighter from neck to armhole
    if necessary. (See rules for fitting.)</p>
  <p class="clear"><img src="images/07_depth-d.jpg" alt="shoulder seam lengthened or shortened to accommodate various shoulder postures" width="132" height="151" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Sloping shoulders, round shoulders, stooped shoulders or fat shoulders often
    require lengthening this line. Slash the pattern from center back to the
    armhole and set in a strip of paper the necessary width to make the back
    the correct depth. The shoulder seam may also be taken up at the top of the
    arm to give a more sloping line. The pattern must fit the back at the top
    of the pattern.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    Crossback</h4>
  <p><img src="images/07_crossback.jpg" alt="armhole altered to fit crossback measurements" width="132" height="154" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Measure across the shoulders, on the half pattern from the center back to
    the armhole at the top. The tape will rest two inches below the neck line
    at the center back. The <strong>lower</strong> crossback should also be measured and checked
    before any alterations are made on the <strong>upper</strong> crossback. Place an extra paper
    for additional width or pencil-mark a narrower crossback at the top.</p>
  <p class="clear"><img src="images/07_fitting-a.jpg" alt="shoulder seam extended, altering armhole curve, or tucks taken at back neck" width="132" height="152" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Also, measure the lower crossback at four inches below the point of the
    shoulder. Measure the pattern at the beginning of the curve of the underarm.
    Many full backs are quite wide at this point and the pattern may require
    widening only at the lower crossback. All alterations will be made at the
    armhole, pasting an extra paper for more width, or marking in on the pattern
    for a narrower back at this point. The lower crossback is seldom more than
    one-half inch narrower than the upper cross back but may be much wider.</p>
  <p class="clear"><img src="images/07_fitting-b.jpg" alt="tuck taken below armhole, or pattern slashed and lengthened to raise or lower waist" width="132" height="171" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />If the lower crossback is wide and the upper back is narrow, tucks can be
    taken at the back of the neck to take up the additional material. After the
    dress is tucked, it should measure the correct width, allowing the material
    to spread at the lower crossback.</p>
  <p>If the individual waist is short or long from the underarm to the waist
    line in the back, the pattern must be altered to fit. The short waisted person
    will require an even tuck across the pattern from the center back to the
    underarm. The long waist will require slashing and spreading the pattern
    at this line.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    The front</h4>
  <p><img src="images/07_front.jpg" alt="bodice front and back joined at shoulder seam, with measurement from nape of neck, around and down front" width="104" height="171" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Pin all the sections of the front of the waist together, crushing in any
    gathers or drapes to match the notches given on the pattern. Pin on any yoke
    sections and overlap and pin any open front sections, matching and pinning
    down the center front line of the pattern. The front of the waist is now
    in one piece. Pin the shoulder seam of the back to the shoulder seam of the
    front; place the pattern flat on a table with the underarm seam open.</p>
  <p>Measure the pattern from the back of the neck down over the shoulder, over
    the bust and straight to the waist, measuring three inches from the center
    front at the waist line.</p>
  <p>If the figure is over-erect, or has a full bust, the pattern may be short.
    This will also indicate that more dart is required at the underarm. Therefore,
    if the pattern is short, slash it from the center front to the under-arm
    seam at the bust line and set in the necessary width. Some of this additional
    material or dart at the seam can be eliminated at the waist line with a curved
    edge at the waist line. See illustration.) Or, the extra underarm length
    will be taken up in a dart.</p>
  <p class="clear"><img src="images/07_front-b.jpg" alt="alterations by tucking at armhole, and slashing and lengthening below armhole" width="132" height="170" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />The figure with the flat chest will require shortening the pattern above
    the bust line and also above the armhole. Take an even tuck across the pattern
    at the chest line from the armhole to the center front.</p>
  <p class="clear"><img src="images/07_front-c.jpg" alt="shoulder seam lengthened, or dart made at bottom of armhole" width="132" height="153" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />If the figure has a full bust, or is over-erect, extra allowance should
    be made at the armhole. (See rules for fitting a plain dress.) The armhole
    can be blocked out and fitted on the figure, as all armholes vary greatly.
    A definite amount cannot be given. The waist will be fitted from the waist
    line upward.</p>
  <p>If the pattern has a shoulder dart, the extra allowance in the armhole will
    be made at the shoulder seam, pasting on from one to three inches of paper
    for a wider dart, sloping to the curve of the front of the arm. If the dart
    on the pattern is at the underarm, or there is no dart in the pattern, then
    an extra dart will be necessary at the underarm seam and the allowance will
    be made at the lower edge of the armhole, allowing from a half inch to two
    inches, depending upon the size of the figure. This extra material, either
    on the shoulder or at the underarm, will be drawn back into a dart to fit
    the figure. (See rules for fitting a plain dress.) The pattern will be matched
    on the original lines <strong>below</strong> the bust line.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/07_underarm.jpg" alt="waist raised by taking tuck across lower portion of pattern" width="70" height="124" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Underarm length</h4>
  <p>The short-waisted figure may be so flat and short-waisted that it will require
    shortening the pattern by taking up a tuck across the front from' the center
    front to the underarm seam. The tuck will be made so as to keep the center
    front line straight.</p>
  <p>The long-waisted figure will require lengthening the pattern at the underarm
    by slashing and spreading the pattern at the same line or extra allowance
    can be made at the waist line. This allowance must be made before cutting
    the dress.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/07_bust-size-b.jpg" alt="bodice joined at side seam, spread flat, and measurement taken across inside along bustline" width="132" height="127" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Bust size</h4>
  <p>Pin the back and front sections together at the underarm seam. Do not join
    the shoulders. Flatten the pattern on the table and measure it across the
    bust line at two inches below the armhole. sloping the tape slightly upward
    in the center back, and down in the center front.</p>
  <p>Check this measurement with the individual measurements with the extra inches
    allowed as directed in taking measurements. This extra allowance is required
    on all dresses with sleeves, even for close fitting. (Remember that the pattern
    represents but one-half of the measurement.)</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/07_too-large.jpg" alt="Sleeve alteration along back and front" width="93" height="156" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Too large</h4>
  <p>If the pattern measures too large, take up the underarm seam until the pattern
    measures correctly (with the additional allowance necessary, 2 to 4 inches
    extra on the half pattern). If the bust is too large the armhole will also
    be smaller but will later be fitted as directed for the dart fitting. The
    seam is usually taken up the same on both back and front.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    Too small</h4>
  <p><img src="images/07_too-small.jpg" alt="additional allowance added to front armhole and front side seams" width="132" height="114" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />If the bust is too small on the pattern, spread the underarm seam until
    the pattern measures the correct amount and paste extra paper to the <strong>front
    section</strong>. Pencil mark the new sewing line as it is pinned to the back side
    seam. Block out the armhole. (See fitting.)</p>
  <p>On very large figures it is often necessary to allow several inches to the
    front side seam section. This will throw out the armhole, as it will be too
    large. Block out the armhole as directed in the <a href="#plain">lesson on
    fitting the plain dress</a> and fit a new armhole on the individual. One well-fitted front section
    can be retained as a guide pattern to use in altering all other patterns.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/07_sleeve.jpg" alt="flat sleeve with line marked top edge below sleeve cap" width="79" height="157" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Sleeve</h4>
  <p>Measure the width of the sleeve pattern at the underarms at the widest point.
    Check the size of the individual arm. A closely fitted sleeve for the small
    arm usually measures from two to three inches larger than the arm. The large
    arm requires at least one inch extra allowance for freedom of motion. If
    the sleeve is too large or too small, make one-third of the alteration down
    the center of the sleeve on a straight line to the elbow, and the other two
    thirds on each side of the sleeve, taking one third from each seam. This
    will retain the sleeve cap. The armhole has already been altered and the
    sleeve should fit the armhole.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/07_sleeve-length.jpg" alt="tucking or slashing and spreading sleeve below  sleeve cap to shorten or lengthen pattern" width="132" height="149" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Sleeve length</h4>
  <p>Shorten or lengthen the sleeve as required for the individual. Make the
    alteration at the elbow. If the arm is short in front and full at the back,
    take up more at the front of the sleeve and less at the back. This type of
    arm requires a great amount of fullness at the elbow. (See sleeve problems.)</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    The skirt</h4>
  <p>Pin<img src="images/07_skirt-b.jpg" alt="pattern joined at side, with measurements across hip and thigh and waist, and an additinal dart taken at waist" width="105" height="162" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /> all the front<img src="images/07_skirt-a.jpg" alt="skirt length adjusted by taking a tuck, or slashing and spreading, well below hip curve" width="122" height="170" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /> sections of the skirt together; shorten or lengthen each
    section to the required measurement, similar to sleeve alteration. Keep all
    tucks or slashes straight across the pattern from the front edge.</p>
  <p>Join all the back portions of the pattern, making any length alterations
    necessary.</p>
  <p>Match the center <strong>front</strong> to the center <strong>back</strong> of the pattern, matching the lower
    edges. Measure the waist line. If too large, mark off an equal amount from
    both the back and the front. If too small, take from the back and front side
    seam an equal amount. Pencil mark on the pattern for the sewing line. Measure
    seven to eight inches below the waist line for the hip size, measuring straight
    across the pattern at this point. The depth of the hip should be measured
    the same as the individual measures, depending upon the height of the person.</p>
  <p>Remember: the pattern represents only one half of the figure. If the hips
    measure thirty-eight inches with the inch allowance, then the half pattern
    should measure nineteen inches. If more should be added, make an equal alteration
    on both the front and the back section.</p>
<h4 class="clear">  Large hips</h4>
  <p><img src="images/07_large-hips.jpg" alt="skirt pattern joined at side seam with measurement line across hip, and pattern marked to extend front and back seam allowance, and a  spreading at waist" width="109" height="144" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />If the hips are large, and the pattern you are using does not provide a
    wide seam for letting out the garment, pin paper to each side the full length
    of the seam.</p>
  <p>Measure across the hip line and enlarge both seams the same amount, gradually
    sloping the line to meet the waist line just marked. If the hips are made
    smaller, the line must also be marked.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/07_exceptions.jpg" alt="pattern altered at only front or only back" width="132" height="140" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Exceptions</h4>
  <p>The figure with the large waist line in proportion to the hip size will
    require most of the additional paper pasted to the front of the pattern on
    the side seam, with possibly no additional allowance on the back of the skirt.</p>
  <p>The figure that is large in the back and flat in the front at the hip line,
    will require more of the seam allowance on the side of the back and none
    on the front.</p>
  <p>Large thighs will require an equal distribution of the allowance. The figure
    with the large bust and small hips will have the seam taken up even on both
    back and front.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    Epaulet raglan sleeves</h4>
  <p><img src="images/07_epaulet.jpg" alt="raglan-style sleeves with epaulets" width="132" height="150" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />All sleeves that extend to the neck line will be fitted in like manner except
    that all alterations will be made on the front and back sections and not
    on the saddle of the sleeve.</p>
  <p>Most of these sleeves do not fit closely at the armpit. This must be taken
    into consideration when fitting this type of sleeve. It is very important
    that the depth of the raglan or epaulet sleeve is sufficiently deep in the
    <strong>back</strong> from the neck to the armpit. A short sleeve at this point will draw
    the sleeve back and be most uncomfortable. Follow the rules for fitting the
    back of the set-in sleeve and let out or take up above the armpit on the
    waist only. Make no alteration on the shoulders of the sleeve. Alter the
    lengths as required.</p>
  <h3><em><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="fit_tissue" id="fit_tissue"></a></font></strong></em>Summary of Fitting Tissue Patterns</h3>
  <p>Pin all the sections of the pattern together all the waist front, all the
    waist back, all the skirt front, and all the skirt back. Also pin the sleeve
    sections together.</p>
  <p>All alterations will be made on the side seams unless the lengths are changed.
    These changes should be made first.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>  Fold down the center back at the armhole to secure the depth of the
      armhole in relation to the back of the neck.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li> Check the depth of the pattern from this line to the neck, and make
    it correspond with the measurement of the individual as taken above the armhole.<br />
    <br />
    </li>
    <li> Measure the pattern across the back between the searing lines or the
    armhole; measure both crossbacks.<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    Mark a narrower crossback if necessary or paste on more paper for a wider
    back to make the tissue pattern the same measure as the individual in both
    the upper and the lower crossback. Mark with colored pencil.<br />
    <br />
    </li>
    <li> Measure the underarm seam. Shorten or lengthen this line if necessary.
    This seam may be lengthened, but is seldom shortened.<br />
    <br />
    </li>
    <li> Open the underarm seams, then pin the shoulders together. Measure the
    length of the front and back from the center of the back of the neck on both
    measurements.<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    If the front is too long, lift the front by taking a tuck across the chest
    from the center front to the underarm seam. If the individual is short-waisted,
    also take a small tuck below the armhole from center front to the underarm
    seam.<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    If too short, lengthen the pattern below the armhole only, never at the
    shoulder, unless a small amount for a sloping shoulder line.<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    Make extra allowance in all armholes for armhole fitting if there has been
    a great change in the pattern. (See lesson on fitting darts.)<br />
    <br />
    </li>
    <li> For the bust fitting, pin the back and front together at the underarm
    seam only. Measure the pattern across the bust line two inches below the
    armpits, slightly sloping upward in the center back.<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    Add more seam to the front if too small; take up evenly on both back and
    front if too large.<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    Be sure to allow two to four inches to the individual measurements to fit
    the pattern.</li>
  </ol>
  <h4>    Sleeve </h4>
  <ol start="7">
    <li>  Measure across the top of the sleeve. If too small, slash the sleeve
      the full length down the center and add one-third of the amount to the
      center and the remainder equally on both side seams.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
    If too large, reduce the size in the same proportion.</li>
  </ol>
  <h4>    Skirt </h4>
  <ol start="8">
    <li>  Lengthen or shorten the skirt by taking up a cross tuck from center
      to side seam, or splitting and spreading the pattern an equal width.</li>
  </ol>
  <h4>    Waist
Hips </h4>
  <ol start="9">
    <li> Place the center front and center back together, matching the lower
      edges at the hem line. Measure across the waist line. Add one inch extra
      to the individual measurements when checking the pattern.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
    Half the pattern will represent half the body measurement.<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    Increase or decrease the size equally on both the back and front sections.
    Mark all alterations with a colored pencil.<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    Continue any hip or thigh alterations
    down the full length of the skirt the same amount as altered at the hip line.</li>
  </ol>
  <h4>    <a name="allowance" id="allowance"></a>Cutting from a Pattern by Making Extra Allowance</h4>
  <p>  It is advisable to always check the pattern lengths and widths to assure ample
    material for fitting. If, however, the figure does not vary greatly in length,
the pattern may be fitted on the figure by cutting with extra seam allowance.</p>
  <p>This type of fitting requires an assistant.</p>
  <h4>    Allowances to make </h4>
  <p>There will be no fitting changes on the inner lines of the dress; all the
    alterations will be made on the side seams, shoulders, and armholes. As it
    may be necessary to let out the seam to secure more length or width, there
    should be an extra seam allowance. An extra seam width is usually sufficient,
    but if more than this is required it may be necessary to buy a larger pattern.
    When patterns already have an extra wide seam, more allowance may not be
    necessary. It is advisable to purchase the bust size, if possible. If the
    figure has <strong>unusually</strong> large hips, make an even wider seam allowance than is
    directed. If the back is unusually broad or long, make a wider seam allowance
    across the back and at the depth of the pattern at the neck in the back.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    Prominent bust allowance</h4>
  <p>The figure<img src="images/07_prominent-b.jpg" alt="armhole alterations to accommodate prominent bust" width="132" height="134" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /> with a <img src="images/07_prominent-bust.jpg" alt="pattern alterations for prominent bust allow extra fabric" width="96" height="150" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />very prominent bust and narrow back will need to use more
    material in the armhole for fitting. For this figure it will be advisable
    to merely <strong>block</strong> out the armhole as illustrated, marking the original armhole
    curve but not cutting the material except as slashed to the curve in front
    of the arm. If the dress has a shoulder dart it will possibly be necessary
    to make the shoulder dart much wider so as to remove the pouch at the armhole.
    The wider dart will require more material, which must be furnished by the
    extra material that was allowed at the top of the armhole. As this extra
    width is often much more than could be allowed on a wider seam, it is far
    better to block out the armhole, use the amount of material necessary and
    then mark a new armhole after the dart is fitted. Marking the original armhole
    with a crease and slashing into the curve of the armhole as illustrated will
    permit the dress and the armhole to be fitted perfectly.</p>
  <h4>    Armhole allowance </h4>
  <p>If additional armhole fitting is necessary, and a shoulder dart is not desired,
    the extra material blocked out at the lower part of the armhole will be drawn
    down into an additional dart at the underarm seam.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/07_sleeve-allowance.jpg" alt="alterations marked to enlarge sleeve" width="88" height="148" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Sleeve allowance</h4>
  <p>If the arm is extra large, and the pattern does not offer sufficient seam,
    make a wider seam allowance on both side seams of the sleeve. Also allow
    an extra half-inch on the sides of the sleeve cap but not at the top.</p>
  <p>As the sleeve is difficult to reshape at the cap, it is advisable to purchase
    another pattern a size larger or smaller, whichever is necessary for the
    arm, and use the new sleeve as a permanent guide for fitting other sleeves.
    This sleeve should be fitted at the lower arm.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/07_allowance-back.jpg" alt="back pattern enlarged along collar, shoulder, armhole, and side seams" width="75" height="129" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Allowance in the back</h4>
  <p>Measure the width and length of the back. If there is any question about
    the ampleness of the pattern, cut wide seams so that you will be prepared
    to widen the crossback or drop the waist at the center back or drop either
    end or both ends of the shoulder in the back, if such adjustments prove to
    be necessary.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/07_retain.jpg" alt="pattern folded and creased to mark original sewing lines" width="71" height="127" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Retain the sewing lines</h4>
  <p>The original sewing lines should be marked so as to space all alterations
    evenly. When placing the pattern on the material, place all pins along the
    sewing lines so that the pin will rest in the fold of the seam as it is pressed
    over at the sewing line to form a crease. The pattern should be pinned to
    the folded goods so as to crease both sides of the dress at the same time.
    Place the pattern side down on the press board and press the seam back at
    the sewing line, creasing both edges of the material. All darts, tucks, pleats,
    hems, folds and centers should be crease marked. For complete instructions
    see the sewing lesson on<a href="hsc-2.html#marking"> &quot;Marking Sewing
    Lines.&quot;</a></p>
  <h4 class="clear">Preparation for Fitting</h4>
  <p>Assume that the dress has<img src="images/07_prep-b.jpg" alt="bodice overlapped" width="119" height="146" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /> been cut with <img src="images/07_prep-a.jpg" alt="pattern with waist and hip yoke and decorative wrist treatment, ready to be fitted" width="132" height="164" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />the additional seam allowance on
    all underarm and side seams of the skirt (unless altered to the exact size),
    waist, and sleeves and also on the shoulders and armholes and the seams have
  been creased on the original sewing lines ready to be basted.</p>
  <p>The dress will be basted together in three units--the complete back with
    the waist and skirt basted together, the complete front with the waist and
    skirt joined at the waist line, and the sleeves basted together for fitting.
    The waist and skirt are not basted separately unless they are to be worn
    separately.</p>
  <p>If the waist or skirt is of a symmetric design, and has one side overlapping
    the other, the sections should be matched down the center and basted together
    as a complete unit for fitting.</p>
  <p class="clear">A dress should be fitted with both sleeves<img src="images/07_prep-d.jpg" alt="bodice back with altered neck and shoulder" width="71" height="128" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /> basted <img src="images/07_prep-c.jpg" alt="skirt with hip curve altered" width="74" height="184" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />into the dress, as one
    sleeve does not permit the back to be properly tested for strain. It requires
    both sleeves for proper fitting.</p>
  <p>The dress will be fitted <strong>right side out</strong>. It is impossible to secure the
    right effect when the garment is fitted wrong side out. The underarm and
    shoulder seams, however, will be pinned together with the seams extending
    on the <strong>right</strong> side. After the dress is fitted and removed, the side seams
    will be creased first to one side and then to the other side to secure a
    correct line for basting, after which the pins are moved. The dress will
    then be sewed together on the creases.</p>
  <p>If the figure is unusually large in the hips and waist, it will be advisable
    to pin the dress together, letting out some of the extra seam allowance on
    the hips or waist before the dress is tried on, so as not to strain the material.</p>
  <p>Special attention is given to the fitting of the depth of scye; the depth
    of the dress in the back from the neck to the line of the armpits, taken
    on a straight line across the back. This measurement varies in all postures
    and in most figures, and should be taken into consideration when fitting,
    as a misfit in this portion of the dress produces many wrinkles, pouches
    and drawings, and much of the discomfort of the garment. The fitting of many
    garments could be improved if this section of the dress were altered even
    if the dress had been completed.</p>
  <h4 class="clear"><em><strong><a name="plain" id="plain"></a></strong></em>Fitting the Plain Dress</h4>
  <p> <img src="images/07_plain.jpg" alt="plain dress with lengthwise grain marked, split at waist" width="68" height="207" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />A dress must be anchored at the waist line and fitted <strong>upward</strong> rather than
    hanging the dress from the shoulders and drawing out the pouches downward.
    <strong>All sections</strong> of the waist and skirt will be fitted upward and downward <strong>from
    the waist</strong>.</p>
  <p>The waist line is fitted <strong>first</strong>, adjusting it to the desired fitting for
    the individual. If the waist of the figure is larger than the pattern, the
    extra seam allowance will be used, and the seam let out an equal amount on
    each side, measuring from the original sewing line. If the waist of the figure
    is smaller than the pattern, take up the seam equally on each side, measuring
    from the sewing line as creased.</p>
  <p>It will be necessary to open the waist at the left underarm seam on figures
    that have small waists, if the dress is made with no other opening. This
    opening at the side will permit the dress to be removed without undue strain
    on the seams. There is a great strain placed upon all seams of a dress if
    it is removed over the head. Many sleeve seams break out in the back when
    the dress is removed. This may explain why it is necessary to fit the sleeves
    with the arms clasped in front.</p>
  <p class="clear"><img src="images/07_prominent-ab.jpg" alt="fitting line to minimize appearance of prominent abdoment" width="61" height="169" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Fit the hips, but do not fit too tight. A figure with a prominent abdomen
    should have the hips fitted sufficiently loose to permit the dress to fall
    in a straight line down the front from the waist when viewing the figure
    from the side. Closely fitted hips emphasize a large abdomen.</p>
  <p>If the side seams of the skirt are altered, the same amount of alteration
    should be made the full length of the skirt.</p>
  <p class="clear"><img src="images/07_hips-let-out.jpg" alt="side seam showing hip alteration" width="73" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />If the hips are let out one-quarter inch, the full length of the skirt should
    be enlarged the same amount on the side seams. If the hip seam is taken in,
    the same amount will be taken in the full length of the seam. The figure
    with larger hips will require the same additional width at the lower edge
    of the skirt as it let out in the side seam; the figure with the smaller
    hips will require the same amount reduced from the lower edge as is reduced
    at the hips. Make all alterations measuring from the original sewing lines.
    If the right and left sides of the figure are different, it will be noticed
    in the side seam of the smaller side. The seam will not hang straight and
    will bulge. Adjust the line until it hangs straight.</p>
  <p>The side seam of the skirt should hang straight, in a perpendicular line
    with the floor, and directly on a line dropped from the underarm. The underarm
    seam of the skirt meets the underarm seam of the waist unless otherwise designed.</p>
  <p class="clear"><img src="images/07_hip-fitting.jpg" alt="hip fitting along yoke" width="73" height="188" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Hip fitting should be tested with the customer seated. Full thighs spread
    when seated and the dress may be too tight below the hips, especially in
    dresses with long closely fitted lines. The fitting should be tested on the
    seated figure straight across the lap at the body line.</p>
  <p>It is advisable to make longer pleats or higher fullness in figures with
    large thighs. Otherwise the side seams of the skirt must be let out, increasing
    the fullness through the thighs for spreading room when seated.</p>
  <p class="clear">After the waist line and skirt have been fitted, the back of the waist will
    then be fitted. If the underarm seam has been properly lengthened or shortened,
    as directed in pattern alterations, the sewing line of the arm curve <img src="images/07_below-shoulders.jpg" alt="crosswise thread running from bottom of armhole to center back" width="89" height="160" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />should
    <img src="images/07_waist-line.jpg" alt="bodice with horizontal strips, and line marking from bottom of arm curve to center back" width="87" height="156" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />rest up to within one-half inch of the pit of the arm, when the arm is lowered.</p>
  <p>Straighten the crosswise thread of material across the back <strong>below</strong> the shoulders.
    If checked gingham is used for the first fitting, the thread of material
    in the checks will be very noticeable. If the thread of material draws upward,
    open the shoulder seams at the neck and allow the goods to drop into a straight
    line from side to side.</p>
  <p class="clear">The pouch of material that appears at the waist line in the back on closely-fitted
    <img src="images/07_waist-pouch.jpg" alt="vertical darts on back, and tuck across waist" width="132" height="181" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />dresses will then be fitted out. It is impossible to fit the concave surface
    of the back with a flat piece of material. If vertical darts in the back
    of the skirt are not used, it will be necessary to tuck under the pouch at
    the waist line and pin out the crosswise dart on the straight line with the
    belt. Removing the pouch in this manner produces a downward curved edge on
    the skirt and an upper curved edge on the waist. When the two curves are
    sewed together in the waist seam, it will fit the curve of the back.</p>
  <p>Vertical tucks may be used on a dress that is cut with the waist and skirt
    in one piece. Extend the tucks both above and below the waist line on both
    sides of the center back. This method is generally used when fitting a dress
    without a belt or when fitting stripes or plaids; this method retains the
    straight line of the stripes across the hips.</p>
  <p class="clear"><img src="images/07_back-fit.jpg" alt="back bodice with arrow pointing from mid-back, striaght up to point of neck and shoulder" width="86" height="160" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />The back has now been fitted from the waist line up to the armpits and will
    require fitting above the armholes. Smooth the material up the center back
    and to the shoulder seams at the neck. Let out or take up the seam to fit.</p>
  <p>Smooth the material upward and outward toward the shoulders, lifting the
    material at the armhole so as to eliminate any possible pouch. The square-shouldered
    figure will require lifting the whole back shoulder seam. The stoop-shouldered
    figure may require only lifting the seam at the armhole and even possibly
    lengthening the center back.</p>
  <p class="clear">Usually the shoulder seam of the back is one half inch longer than the shoulder
    seam of the front, but in fitting the stooped shoulders this fullness may
    be increased. If the extra<img src="images/07_shoulder-seam.jpg" alt="darts taken at center back from neck edge" width="87" height="157" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /> fullness is<img src="images/07_smooth.jpg" alt="back bodice with lines pointing from waist to undearm, top of armhole, neck and shoulder juncture, and straight to center back neck" width="85" height="155" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /> more than can be eased out in the
    seam, the surplus can be eased over toward the center back and taken up in
    tucks at the back of the neck.</p>
  <p>The necessity for darts in the front of a waist is often minimized. Darts
    are not only used to fit the curves of the bust but are also used to fit
    the receding lines of the shoulders on closely fitted garments. The necessity
    for darts can be seen by viewing any figure from the side. Notice that the
    figure is on a straighter line in the back from the waist to the shoulders
    than ,the front, but the thickness of the body, receding to the shoulders,
    produces a sloping surface in the front that requires a dart arrangement
    even though the bust may not be prominent. The straighter the back, the greater
    the necessity for darts.</p>
  <p class="clear">Dart fittings are <img src="images/07_dart-fittings.jpg" alt="different styles of darts and yokes on bodice" width="132" height="147" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />arranged<img src="images/07_darts.jpg" alt="side view showing sway and straight back" width="128" height="193" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /> in various places, often disappearing in the
    design of the dress. Darts are placed on the shoulders, or under the arm
    in a direct line from the bust to the underarm seam, either in a horizontal
    line or sloping downward at an angle. If the underarm dart is large, it may
    be divided into two or more darts as desired. More than one dart are more
    becomingly placed at an angle.</p>
  <p>Darts may also be worked out in various yoke effects, often with the joining
    seams cut on curved lines. Cowl necks, various draped effects, gathers or
    darts at the waist, all are used when fitting the curves of the figure. If
    darts are not used when necessary, the dress will pouch either at the front
    or at the armhole. This indicates the lack of sufficient dart in the garment.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    Additional darts at the underarm when necessary </h4>
  <p>All garments except coats can be fitted with extra darts at the underarm
    if necessary. If the dress has a yoke seam extending to the underarm seam
    near the bust line, the seam can be fitted in to eliminate the visible dart.
    The same rule is followed at the shoulder, fitting in the surplus material
    into any seams of yokes or intricate cuts extending to the neck.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/07_shoulder-dart.jpg" alt="different shoulder dart treatments" width="132" height="183" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Shoulder dart</h4>
  <p>Shoulder dart fitting indicates any front fitting above the bust line, with
    the dress fitting smooth down the front, across the front at the waist line,
    and smooth around the armhole. There should be one inch ease in the front
    of the armhole for freedom of motion on all dresses with sleeves. It is,
    therefore, advisable to provide for this ease before fitting out any pouch
    at the front of the arm curve. Pin in a half-inch dart in the armhole which
    will be made with one inch of material. This will not be sewed as the pin
    will be removed when the sleeve is set into the armhole. Smooth the material
    upward from the armpit, around the arm curve and up to the <strong>center</strong> of the
    shoulder seam.</p>
  <p>If there is not sufficient dart arrangement, it will be necessary to use
    some of the additional seam allowance at the armhole, drawing it over toward
    the neck so as to remove any pouch at the front of the armhole.</p>
  <p>Stoop-shouldered or hollow-chested figures often find it necessary to lift
    the front of the waist the full length of the shoulder seam, which will also
    require changing the neck line in front.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/07_shoulder-dart.jpg" alt="different styles of darts under the arm" width="132" height="183" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Underarm dart pulls down from the armpit</h4>
  <p>The underarm dart is fitted
      from the waist line upward in the center front to the shoulder and across
      the chest, lifting or lowering the shoulder seams
      if necessary. Pin in the usual one-inch ease in the armhole as described
      for shoulder darts and join the underarm seams to the back for two inches
      down the seam. Then fit upward from the waist line on the underarm seam,
      joining the seam to the back and taking up the remaining pouch of goods
    that appears at the armhole and making one, two, or more darts at the underarm
  seam to match the back seam.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">Sleeves</h4>
  <p>A plain, <img src="images/07_sleeves-plain.jpg" alt="pull lines at side seam and back armhole" width="62" height="155" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />one-piece sleeve should be fitted well up to the pit of the arm
    in order to be comfortable, and the closer the sleeve comes to the pit of
    the arm the closer the dress can be fitted comfortably. A dress that is cut
    out low under the arm will be drawn up when the arm is raised, and not only
    will the dress draw across the top of the sleeve, but the strain will pull
  out the seams and draw the dress out of shape at the waist line.</p>
  <p class="clear">There are various<img src="images/07_sleeves-loose.jpg" alt="dolman-style sleeves" width="110" height="121" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /> designs in loose sleeves which will vary the shape and
    size of the armhole, and in this case the armhole of the pattern will be
    followed, as the dress is not intended to fit closely under the arm and any
    pouches will not be noticeable. The folds illustrated in the pattern sketch
    will give this information, but the front and back sections must be fitted.
    A tested fitted sleeve pattern will indicate the necessary changes on all
    patterns.</p>
  <p class="clear">Altered shoulder <img src="images/07_sleeves-refitted.jpg" alt="armhole clipped" width="86" height="160" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />seams and refitted armholes usually require a new armhole
    placement. To mark the armhole, tie a string around the arm, pinning it at
    the bone on the shoulder. Mark the line of the string in the back as the
    <strong>arms are clasped in front</strong>, and mark the front with the hands clasped in the
    back. This will allow for freedom of motion in the width of the crossback
    and the width of the chest. The fitted armhole should rest to within one-half
    inch of the pit of the' arm. Remove the pin that has been holding the half-inch
    dart at the armhole curve in front (see direction for fitting darts), and
    the sleeve will be ready to set.</p>
  <p class="clear">If an armhole seems to <img src="images/07_armhole.jpg" alt="armhole with clipped edges" width="81" height="129" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />be too tight, clip into the front curve of the arm
    for one-quarter inch only. This extra amount will usually remove any strain.
    <strong>Never</strong> cut out under the arm to make an armhole larger. It will make the armhole
    larger but will also increase the discomfort of the dress and sleeve and
    will not improve the fitting of the garment.</p>
  <p class="clear">Slide <img src="images/07_slide.jpg" alt="sleeve with pin marking center top" width="75" height="141" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />the sleeve into the armhole and pin it to the dress, matching the
    underarm seam of the dress to the underarm seam of the sleeve. Drop the arm
    to the side and adjust the top of the sleeve to the armhole so that there
    will be an equal amount of fullness on both the back and front half of the
    sleeve cap. There should be about three-fourths inch ease in both the back
    and the front of the sleeve cap to make it possible to fit the sleeve over
    the curve of the shoulder and to allow for freedom of motion. If the sleeve
    has no fullness in the sleeve cap, the sleeve will draw in the cap when the
    arm is brought forward.</p>
  <p>If the sleeve is too large, take up the underarm seam, allowing from one
    to two inches more than the actual size of the upper arm. If the sleeve is
    too small, the extra seam allowance will be let out on the underarm seam
    of the sleeve.</p>
  <p>As the arm hangs to the side, notice the crosswise threads of material.
    If the sleeve is too short from the armpit to the shoulder, the threads of
    material will draw upward in the center of the sleeve and should be dropped
    from the shoulder to permit the threads to straighten and eliminate the drawing
    in the sleeve cap. If there is not sufficient seam allowance at the top of
    the sleeve to permit it to be dropped the same effect can be secured by lifting
    the sleeve at the underarm seam.</p>
  <p class="clear"><img src="images/07_sleeve-cap.jpg" alt="sleeve cap alterations" width="132" height="165" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Fitting the upper part of the sleeve does not solve all the sleeve-fitting
    problems. The lower arm often causes more difficulty than the upper arm.
    The lower arm is not always in proportion to the size of the upper arm in
    that the arm does not taper sufficiently to conform to the general rules
    of fitting. A plain fitted sleeve requires a dart or gathers at the elbow
    and the larger the lower arm the larger the dart. The shape of the sleeve
    varies on the back edge in fitting, as the back edge of the sleeve is let
    out or taken up more than the front edge.</p>
  <p>When fitting the lower arm, raise the hand to the face so as to enlarge
    the lower arm to its fullest extent. The lower arm will then be fitted the
    exact size of the arm with no allowance for ease, the raised arm will indicate
    the exact size of the sleeve.</p>
  <p>If the lower arm or elbow of the sleeve is too loose, take up the sleeve
    on the <strong>back edge</strong> with the arm bent. This will reduce the size of the elbow
    dart or diminish the fullness at the elbow. Let out the back seam if sleeve
    is tight.</p>
  <p class="clear"><img src="images/07_surplus.jpg" alt="sleeve alteration at wrist" width="78" height="161" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />The sleeve may also be too loose at the wrist. If an alteration is to be
    made, take out the surplus material from the back edge of the sleeve seam,
    permitting the front seam to remain the same. The close-fitted wrist requires
    an opening to permit the sleeve to be removed. If the opening is not desired
    at the seam, slash the sleeve for two inches on a straight line with the
    arm just above the wrist bone in the back of the sleeve. This would also
    be the line used for a long opening with buttons. This line is usually about
    two inches from the back seam of a fitted sleeve.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    Sleeve fullness is eased out on the bias</h4>
  <p><img src="images/07_fullness.jpg" alt="sleeve with grid markings to show where fullness can be eased out on bias" width="101" height="114" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />The fullness in the sleeve cap is fitted out on the <strong>bias</strong> sections of the
    sleeve. The cap of the sleeve is flat for three inches across the top and
    for three inches under the arm, the fullness being eased out between these
    sections. Divide up the fullness on the back of the sleeve cap, with the
    sleeve cap folded under, pin the sleeve to the armhole on the customer gradually
    dividing the fullness. The sleeve will be basted in from the right side (see
    directions on sewing).</p>
  <h4>    Mark alterations </h4>
  <p>Open the side of the dress so as to remove it without straining the seams,
    carefully marking the altered lines with chalk or pins. The length of the
    opening will depend upon the figure.</p>
  <h4>    Noting alterations </h4>
  <p>After the dress is removed, carefully notice the chalk mark and changes
    from the original sewing lines. Write down the exact amount of change on
    each seam. These notations will be used later to alter other patterns of
    the same make. Alterations will then be made only on the seams that required
    altering on the test pattern. The remainder of the seams will not be altered
    from the original sewing lines.</p>
  <h4>    Various makes of patterns </h4>
  <p>The same alterations will be required for the same individual on the same
    make of pattern, but the alterations may differ on other patterns. It will,
    therefore, be advisable to make the extra seam allowance on all side seams
    and shoulders of all patterns until a test has been made for individual fitting
    for that pattern.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/07_intricate.jpg" alt="alterations made to raglan-sleeved bodice" width="132" height="142" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Intricate shoulder fitting</h4>
  <p>Patterns with intricate shoulders will be handled somewhat differently.
    Epaulet shoulders and raglan sleeves are made with two shoulder seams, and
    while the fitting rules are the same, the difference should be explained.
    The shoulder section of the sleeve will not be altered. The alteration will
    all be made on the shoulder sections of the front and back of the waist rather
    than on the sleeve. If the back of the dress is too long, the change will
    be made by lifting or dropping the shoulder section of the back (not the
    sleeve). If the front needs to be changed, the shoulder section of the front
    (not the sleeve) will be lifted or lowered.</p>
  <h4>    Seam allowance on intricate shoulders </h4>
  <p>Extra seam allowance will be made on the shoulders and underarm seams of
    the back and front sections, the sleeve will have only an extra underarm
    seam allowance.</p>
  <p>Lift or drop the back or front sections by fitting <strong>upward</strong> to join the sleeve.
    Join the sleeve to the altered shoulder line.</p>

<h4>Use a mirror when fitting </h4>
  <p>Fit before a mirror, even when fitting others. The mirror will indicate
    defects in fitting that cannot be detected with the naked eye and will also
    give the effect as soon at a distance.</p>

  </ol>
  <h4>Intricate designs </h4>
  <p>Intricate designs in sleeves are fitted by approximately the same rules.
    Fit upward for a fitted waist line. Lift the back, lift the front sections,
    and fit out surplus material, or let out seams on the front or back sections
    in preference to altering the sleeve lines.</p>
  <h4>Fitting Coats</h4>
  <p>    Coats fit looser A coat should be fitted with ample looseness as it will
      be worn over a dress and will be lined, with even a possible interlining.
      This extra material must all be taken into consideration when fitting the
      pattern to individual measurements.</p>
  <p>It is advisable to first fit a dress pattern to determine the necessary
    alterations, if any, then the same amount of alterations should be made on
    the coat pattern, as the pattern will be made with the necessary looseness
    for the average coat.</p>
  <p>If the pattern does not offer sufficient width through the back or front
    or sleeves, extra allowance must be utilized on all side seams, the exact
    amount will be determined in the dress fitting. The crossback will be fitted
    according to the dress measurements without additional allowance for looseness
    over the amount allowed in the pattern.</p>
  <p>If a dress has not been fitted previously, the bust, waist and hips should
    bi made at least two inches larger than measured for the dress fitting; this
    will only give looseness for average material. Heavy material with an interlining
    will require a four-inch allowance. The necessary amount of looseness must
    be judged by the individual, if the figure is disproportionate.</p>

  <h2>    Introduction&#8212;How to Learn to Sew</h2>
  <p>Sewing becomes an interesting pastime when each operation develops perfectly
    without the struggle of numerous alterations and rippings. This is only possible
    when the construction is understood step by step so that the garment can
  be made without wasted time and effort.</p>
  <p>The beginner should not be too ambitious to cut the first dress from the
    most difficult material and a complicated pattern as the first dress, even
    of the most simple design, will contain many problems that should be mastered
    before the more difficult patterns and materials are attempted.</p>
  <p>The first dress should be sleeveless or made with loose low armholes to
    avoid sleeve fitting difficulties. The pattern should be of very few sections;
    the number of sections is usually given on the back of the pattern envelope.
    The dress should be plain, without pleats, tucks, sheering or pointed sections
    as each develops an additional problem that should be learned after the first
    dress is made.</p>
  <p>The different problems encountered in sewing make it interesting as each
    garment will contain something new that will easily unfold if the principles
    of sewing are understood. Sewing is only difficult when these fundamentals
    are not mastered.</p>
  <p>A firmly woven print offers an excellent beginner's material. There are
    many attractive fabrics in small figures or checks that will be most encouraging
    for the beginner's work as the figures have a tendency to obliterate any
    errors in sewing.</p>
  <p>The pattern should be selected first, then the instructions should be read,
    or the sales girl asked as to the kind of material to be used with the pattern.
    Many failures in sewing are attributed to inappropriate choice of material
    for the pattern used. Simplicity should also predominate in the first dress.
    The beginner should not attempt to be too original and thus become conspicuous
    in her clothes. A simple dress made in the prevailing style, of a popular
    fabric for the season, will not be conspicuous and when the dress is fitted
    and made according to the instructions given in this course of lessons, the
    garment will be a success and will be a pleasure to wear.</p>
  <p>The beginner should read each lesson pertaining to the subject encountered
    when making the garment. She should experiment with each detail as it is
    presented. If each subject is worked out step by step as it is explained
    in the text it will unfold much easier than when trying to understand all
    the details from the text and illustrations.</p>
  <p>The principles of sewing can thus be learned at home or at school on a small
    table or at the desk with only a few sewing tools. All that is necessary
    for study and experiment is a paper of pins, needle and thread, thimble and
    scissors, ruler and pencil, a roll of crepe-paper of any color, and this
    set of Helen Hall's Home Sewing Books. The crepe-paper should be cut into
    two ten-inch rolls and all the sewing equipment kept in a box. The beginner
    should paste all her sewing samples in a loose leaf note book to keep for
    reference.</p>
  <p>The crepe-paper offers many advantages: It sews easily, lies flat, has a
    decided lengthwise grain of material, it can be pressed and creased with
    the fingers without the use of an iron, can be pencil-marked easily, and
    does not stretch unless pulled. It is also more encouraging to sew with paper
    as it is cheaply discarded for a fresh piece rather than ripping threads
    in goods.</p>
  <p>Ten-inch squares of soft firm cotton fabric can also be kept in the sewing
    box for pick-up stitch experiments as these cannot be made in paper. Samples
    of various materials should also be used for experiments in the later lessons.</p>
  <p>The beginner who has never made a dress will find it more encouraging to
    make the first dress for a tiny tot rather than for herself. It will cost
    but little, will require no fitting, will embody all the sewing experiments
    necessary for making an adult dress, the seams will be short, the pattern
    is small and the garment will be most attractive when finished.</p>
  <p>The young girl will find it most interesting to make infants' garments in
    school. The material is soft and easy to sew, the seams are short and the
    finished lesson is attractive. The finished garments would cost but little
    and could be used for doll clothes or given away.</p>
  <p>The first garment should be a baby slip cut-out by the teacher. This tiny
    garment would teach many of the first steps in sewing. The next garment could
    be a simple tiny dress with the sleeves cut in one with the dress. The third
    would be a dress with sleeves; three lovely garments that any little girl
    will &quot;LOVE&quot; to make and she will build a foundation for future
interest in making her own garments.</p>

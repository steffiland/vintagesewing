<h3><font

  <h4>Make samples </h4>
  <p>Buttonholes are easy if made according to professional methods. They offer
    an excellent trimming for many dresses and often give that center of interest
    so desired. As materials are handled differently, it is advisable to make
    two or three buttonholes in the material of the dress before the buttonholes
    are made on the garment itself. The secret of quick, perfect work is in the
    pressing. Basting back the buttonhole on most material is very tedious when
    the iron will do the work with speed and perfection. It is not necessary
    to baste any part of the buttonhole unless so desired.</p>
  <h4>    Easiest method </h4>
  <p>The easiest way to make a bound buttonhole is to make it with one piece
    of material rather than to bind each side of a slash. If the slashed opening
    is bound, it makes heavy ridges in the binding and is made in this manner
    only when bias seam binding is used.</p>
  <h4>    When made </h4>
  <p>Bound buttonholes are made before the dress is assembled, while worked buttonholes
    are made after the garment is finished. The buttonhole is made through but
    one thickness of the goods, and the facing is applied later. It is easier
    to stitch, turn and finish a buttonhole on a small section rather than on
    the finished garment.</p>
  <p>    Length Bound buttonholes are seldom made less than one inch long. If the
      buttons are small, tailored loops are then used as on neck closings and
      the backs of sleeves. These loops are applied to slashed opening while
buttonholes must lap over the button.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/03_marking.jpg" alt="overlaping center front, asymmetrical, with true center front line marked" width="131" height="148" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Marking</h4>
  <p> The pattern usually marks the line for the buttonhole, but when remodeling
    a garment plan to make the buttonhole slashed with the straight thread of
    material. If on a lapel, follow the straight thread of the goods when cutting
    rather
    than making the buttonhole at right angles to the edge. If it must be made
    on the bias, then baste a straight piece of cotton material under the buttonhole
  before it is made.</p>
<h4>    Do not guess at spacing</h4>
  <p>Buttonholes should be carefully measured and marked before they are made.
    A crooked or poorly spaced buttonhole is very noticeable and often ruins
    the appearance of the garment. There is a rule for spacing buttons and buttonholes
    and this rule should be followed rather than to guess where they are to be
    placed.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/03_marking.jpg" alt="buttonhole placement marked based on the diameter of the button being used" width="131" height="148" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Edge placement</h4>
  <p>The button will rest at the <strong>end</strong> of the buttonhole and not in the middle.
    The buttonhole will also be made on the garment before the facing is applied
    and a seam must be allowed at the edge. Press back the sewing line for marking
    until this rule becomes fully understood, otherwise the buttonhole <strong>may</strong> be
    cut too close to the edge of the dress.</p>
  <p>After the edge seam is pressed back to mark the sewing line at the edge,
    place a button on the edge and mark back the width of the button, placing
    a pin at the mark. Then place the button at this pin and mark another button
    length for the length of the opening.</p>
  <p>The shank of the button, or the threads that hold it in place, will take
    up an eighth-inch on all but large buttons. Add this eighth-inch at the front
    of the buttonhole toward the edge seam. This will make the opening one-eighth
    inch larger than the button. Very large buttons will require a quarter-inch
    for the shank.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/03_spacing.jpg" alt="vertical row with buttonhole spacing marked" width="98" height="154" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Rule for spacing</h4>
  <p>When there will be a row of buttonholes, mark the first and last before
    spacing those in the center. After the first and last are marked, place the
    section on a table; with the ruler, draw a chalk line down both front and
    back edge of all the row. They will be evenly spaced unless unevenly grouped,
    and the general rule to follow will be to space them <strong>twice the width
    of the button apart</strong>. This rule will vary to a trifle wider width but not narrower.
    Mannish tailored garments such as shirt waists and coats have the buttons
    spaced wider. Long rows of buttons without buttonholes are placed quite close
    together.</p>
  <h4>    Marking a row </h4>
  <p>After the first and last buttonholes are marked, cut a strip of paper the
    length between the two marked buttonholes. Mark on the paper twice the width
    of the button to be used, and fold it up accordingly. If it does not come
    out even, widen each space a trifle until the folds are even.</p>
  <p>After the correct width is found, place the paper on the material, and place
    a pin to correspond with the creases. This will space the buttonholes quickly.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/03_marked.jpg" alt="bodice front showing buttonholes marked on both sides" width="87" height="129" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Marked on
both sides</h4>
  <p>Measure both the back and the front line of buttonholes so that they will
    be straight. Chalk mark the line for each buttonhole. Then baste through
    each chalk mark, as the line will be used on the right side to place the
    binding material and the basting must go through to the back as a guide for
    stitching. The buttonhole will be stitched from the dress material and not
    over the binding.</p>
  <p>If the material is loosely woven or is cut on the bias, it is advisable
    to baste a straight stay down the line to hold the stitching firm. This stay
    must be placed before the buttonholes are basted through from the right side,
    for the stitching will be done from this side. Baste and stitch through both
    dress and the stay.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/03_binding.jpg" alt="front with binding strips behind buttonholes" width="103" height="142" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Binding material</h4>
  <p>The strips for the binding are generally made of the same material as the
    garment and can be cut on the lengthwise, crosswise, or bias. The bias and
    crosswise may make a more attractive trimming, but the lengthwise will make
    the firm edge and will be easier to handle.</p>
  <p>Each strip should be cut separately, as one continuous strip will make each
    section too small. Large separate sections must not overlap the next buttonhole.</p>
  <p>Cut the scraps as wide as possible, at least one inch longer and two inches
    wider than the finished buttonhole. It does not pay to skimp on the size
    of the material used, the larger scrap will work much quicker. It will be
    trimmed off after it is finished.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/03_stitching.jpg" alt="buttonholes marked on binding fabric" width="112" height="148" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Stitching</h4>
  <p>It is customary for dressmakers to mark all the buttonholes, then baste
    on all the scraps, then stitch them all, then slash them all, turn them all
    and finish. Do not finish one at a time.</p>
  <p>After all the buttonholes are marked through to the reverse side, the binding
    material is ready to apply. If the material had a definite line on the lengthwise
    thread, all the scraps should be pressed down the center on this line.</p>
  <p>This center line will mark the visible part of the binding and the line
    should not be crooked. Apply this scrap to the chalk mark and basted line
    on the <strong>right</strong> side of the garment, matching the fold of the crease to the
    basted line, placing it exactly in the center of the line with an equal amount
    extending at each end. Pin to place carefully with several pins. The pins
    will hold it for stitching.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/03_stitch.jpg" alt="stitchlines marked on bound buttonhole" width="127" height="114" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Stitch</h4>
  <p>Turn to the wrong side with the scraps down on the machine. The basted lines
    will now be followed on each side. Start stitching to the side of the center
    of one of the lines and not at the point. Stitch one-eighth inch from the
    edge. (It is advisable for the amateur to practice on large buttonholes with
    a quarter-inch of stitching from the line until the rules are learned.)</p>
  <p>Stitch to the end of the line, keeping on even width from the center. When
    the end is reached, lower the needle into the goods, lift the presser foot
    and turn the goods. Lower the presser foot and <strong>count</strong> the stitches across
    the end. The narrower the buttonhole the better it will look when made correctly.
    Four stitches are usually sufficient unless the larger practice buttonhole
    is being made.</p>
  <p>After the end is stitched, turn the corner as before and stitch down the
    other side, keeping an even distance from the center. Turn the third corner
    and count the stitches of equal number on the other end. Overlap the stitching
    when the end is reached. If the material is loosely woven, stitch around
    the second time closely. Check to determine if the straight thread of material
    was followed on the right side of the material. Remove the bastings or pins,
    fold back the scrap to be sure that the thread is straight before slashing
    the opening. After the buttonhole is cut it cannot be changed, a remade buttonhole
    is always larger and longer.</p>
  <h4>    Clip open </h4>
  <p>After it has been checked slash the center mark with sharp-pointed scissors
    along the basting. Start to cut at the center of the line and not at the
    end. The end must be clipped into a V-shaped section to be used later to
    hold the buttonhole together.</p>
  <p>Clip from the center slash to each of the corners at the end of the line,
    but be sure not to clip the stitching. If it should accidentally be clipped,
    be sure to restitch it before turning.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/03_pull.jpg" alt="binding pulled through to wrong side of buttonhole" width="128" height="125" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Pull through</h4>
  <p> The binding is now ready to pull through to the wrong side, drawing out
    the corners. Have the iron ready <strong>and press open the opening into
    a rectangle.
    Be
  sure to press the corners perfect.</strong></p>
<h4 class="clear">    Press to shape</h4>
  <p><img src="images/03_shape.jpg" alt="binding of buttonhole being pressed along opening" width="127" height="127" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Each edge of the binding will now be <strong>pressed
      to shape</strong>. This will eliminate
    the basting and will make the line more perfect. The seam remains on the
    outside of the binding.</p>
  <p>Bring one side of the binding up to fill exactly <strong>half</strong> of the space; fold
    back and press. Lift the other side to fill the remaining space and press
    back. If the pressing has been made even, the lines will be perfect and there
    will be two tiny inverted box pleats at the end of each line. Moisture should
    be used when possible.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/03_end.jpg" alt="fabric folded back to show both sides of buttonhole in the process of being stitched" width="120" height="126" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Stitch the end</h4>
  <p> Lift the box pleat and stitch it to the point with the binding side down
    on the machine. This completes the buttonhole unless a facing is used. The
    edges
    can be caught to the seam if so desired. The edges are then trimmed off.
    On wash material they are turned back in a finish. The buttonhole is not
    stitched
  around the edges from the right side.</p>
  <h4>    Facing finish </h4>
  <p>The buttonhole is made free from the facing which is later finished to the
    buttonhole.</p>
  <p>Press the finished buttonhole flat and trim off the extra width of binding.
    After the facing is stitched on and the edge seam is pressed open, it is
    basted to the dress at the edge and around the buttonhole.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/03_clipped.jpg" alt="bound buttonhole clipped to right side" width="123" height="117" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Clipped from the
right side</h4>
  <p>After the facing is basted over the opening, it is clipped through from
    the right side.</p>
  <p>It is then turned to the wrong side and clipped to the end of the buttonhole.
    Push under the raw edges with the needle and catch to the buttonhole as far
    back as the binding at the center. Graduate to a point at the end.</p>
  <p>    Lapel If the buttonhole is on a lapel, and will be visible from both the
      right and the wrong side, the facings must be finished with square corners,
      clipping the ends to two points as in the binding. Push under and slip
      stitch to the buttonhole on the exact sewing line, using small stitches,
      then press.</p>
  <h4>    Commercial
seam binding</h4>
  <p>When using bias binding for buttonholes, the line for the buttonhole must
    be opened before it is bound and must be applied skillfully. It can be done
    beautifully with practice.</p>
  <p>Clip open the buttonhole to within a quarter of an inch of the end. Clip
    to the points. Baste on the binding with it extending one-quarter-inch on
    the wrong side. The binding must cover one-half of the opening.</p>
  <p>Make the other side and press flat. Turn and stitch the points at the end
    on the wrong side to the two extended ends of the binding.</p>
  <p>Practice making several buttonholes.</p>

  <h3>      <b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="tailored" id="tailored"></a></font></b>TAILORED LOOPS</h3>
  <h4>    Uses for loops </h4>
  <p>Loops of material are often used for buttonholes, especially for coat closings
    and for small buttons on slashed openings such as the back of the neck or
    wrists of the sleeve. They are placed quite close together in groups and
    are made without cord when used on dresses. The seam allowance on the side
    of the stitched material will form the filling when the strip is turned.</p>
<h4 class="clear">  <img src="images/03_material.jpg" alt="fabric with bias lines showing where loop will be cut" width="119" height="114" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Material</h4>
  <p>Loops are made from the same material as the garment. They are cut on a
    true bias with a salvage across one end if possible, the width depending
    upon the weight of the material. The thinner the material the smaller the
    loop will be unless a wide seam is allowed for a filler. The finished loop
    should be round like a cord and not flat, this will require a complete filling
    of the turned cord.</p>
  <h4>    Seam allowance </h4>
  <p>The width of the seam allowance will also depend upon its use. It is advisable
    to make a sample to determine the desired width of the finished loop and
    also to determine the necessary width of the seam with which to fill it.
    If too much seam has been allowed or the seam has been stitched too narrow
    it will be very difficult if not impossible to turn. Thin material will require
    a wide seam allowance, but a narrow width stitched for the cord, while coating
    will require a narrow seam and a wider space stitched for the cord.</p>
  <p>    Stitching Cut a true bias strip. There can be no joining seams. Cut several
      strips if necessary but do not sew them together. If several loops are
      to be made it is advisable to cut one long strip of true bias if possible.
      (See rules for cutting true bias.) Gauge the width of the folded edge,
      watching the space between the needle and the folded edge.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/03_loop.jpg" alt="bias strip folded along length and sewn" width="45" height="184" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Stitching
the loop</h4>
  <p>Baste the bias strip double before it is stitched. Keeping the bias folded
    even will prevent the loops from twisting. After one becomes experienced
    it will not be necessary to baste the strip, but the amateur should baste
    at all times.</p>
  <p>Prepare to stitch. If there is more than one presser foot for the machine
    use one that permits seeing close to the needle. Gauge the width of the stitching
    from the needle to the folded edge.</p>
  <p><strong>Stitch slowly and stretch the bias,</strong> pulling from both ends while stitching.
    If the material is not stretched when it is stitched the threads of the stitching
    will break when the strain is placed upon them when it is turned. The line
    of stitching must be straight along the fold edge as this width will control
    the width of the loop. If the fold is too wide, it can be restitched over
    the first stitching. The seam will appear much wider after stitching as the
    width reduces when stretched. Test the correct width with a sample turned
    and completed.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/03_turn.jpg" alt="using a bodkin to turn the strip rightside out" width="47" height="173" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Turn the strip</h4>
  <p>When the folded bias has been stitched correctly, slide a bodkin into the
    end with the selvage and sew the eye of the bodkin to the point of the folded
    selvage. The selvage prevents the threads from pulling out when the bodkin
    is pulled through.</p>
  <p>The bodkin will now be <strong>inside</strong> of the loop ready to pull the seam through
    it. The thread must be firm and tacked to the bodkin securely so that the
    thread will not break.</p>
  <h4>    Pull through </h4>
  <p>Pull the bodkin through the stitched fold, gradually working off the material
    from the head of the bodkin. It may be difficult to start if the goods is
    bunched at the head of the bodkin. A good loop will pull hard, for it must
    be closely packed, but it should not be too tight. If the first cord does
    not pull through try again with a wider opening or a narrower seam. If it
    is too thin make a wider seam allowance and stitch narrower. A little practice
    will make perfect, and the results are quite thrilling.</p>
  <h4>    Coat loops </h4>
  <p>Loops for coats should be reinforced with a cord or tape, or a narrow selvage
    might be pulled through the loop. After the bias material has been cut, stitched
    and turned the bodkin is slid into the turned loop and the cord or tape is
    sewed to the eye of the bodkin. The cord is then pulled through with the
    bodkin, sewing the cord to it. The loop can then be stitched into the coat
    seam; or, if there is no seam on the edge, the long ends can be twisted into
    a snail and can be slip stitched and tacked to the edge of the coat. The
    loop should protrude at the edge.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/03_application.jpg" alt="different ways to apply loops to garment" width="132" height="189" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Application
of loops</h4>
  <p>Loops are applied to an unfinished seam. The ends of the loops must be caught
    in the stitching when the facing is applied. Therefore, it is necessary to
    baste a colored line for the ending of the loops as they will all be of equal
    length. The final stitching of the facing to the dress will follow the colored
    line.</p>
  <p>The seam should be quite narrow, as loops are usually used on a slashed
    opening. Baste a line down the seam at the edge of the stitching for the
    facing. This will be about one quarter-inch seam. All the loops will be tacked
    to place just below this line so that the basting need not be removed. Loops
    are basted with the ends outward and the loops toward the garment.</p>
  <h4>    Three methods </h4>
  <p>Loops can be applied in any one of three methods. Each loop can be clipped
    off and with the ends held together can be basted to the seam (see illustration).
    Or the loops can be applied in one continuous strip with the loops spread
    out and the sides of the joining loop touching (see illustration). Or each
    loop can be clipped off and sewed to place with ends touching the next loop.
    This loop is made quite open and close to the seam.</p>
  <h4>    Continuous </h4>
  <p>After the binding is finished back, the tiny loops will protrude in waves.
    The buttons should be tested to determine the correct width of the finish.
    The bias facing is finished flat to the dress.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/03_thread_loops.jpg" alt="how to form a chain-stitch loop" width="132" height="68" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Thread loops</h4>
  <p> Buttonholes are often made with buttonhole twist, especially when just
    one button is used to close an opening. The loops are used both for a closing
    and
    for a trimming. They are made with a fine crochet hook or the dressmaker
    often makes them with her fingers. (See lesson on belt loops.) Catch the
    end of the
    thread to the wrong side of the dress. Pull through a loop with the hook
    and crochet a loop and catch to the goods. The thread should match the material
  perfectly.</p>
  <p>Practice making and applying loops.</p>

  <h3>      <b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="bias" id="bias"></a></font></b>BIAS BINDING</h3>
  <h4 class="clear">      <img src="images/03_binding-b.jpg" alt="binding being applied to edge of garment" width="132" height="99" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Binding versus facing</h4>
  <p>A binding is an edge finish that rolls over the edge without turning under
    the seam. It is visible on both the right and wrong side. It is used as a
    finish on necks and sleeves when there are no collars or cuffs to be attached.
    It is also used to finish sections of the garment such as collars, cuffs
    and hems.</p>
  <p>Facings are edge finishes that are turned back at the edge and are only
    visible on one side of the garment.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/03_false.jpg" alt="finishing the seam by leaving an edge long enough to fold over the seam, tucking raw edge in" width="132" height="154" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />False binding</h4>
  <p>A false binding is a small tuck taken on the wrong side of a straight edge
    and this tuck is used as the seam when the raw edge is folded over and finished
    down as a binding.</p>
  <h4>    Corresponding finish </h4>
  <p>An edge is either bound faced complete, it is never partly bound and partly
    faced. If the neck line is partially covered with a collar, the collar must
    be faced back, which will necessitate facing the complete neck line. The
    neck and sleeve edge should also harmonize.</p>
  <p>All binding should be made narrow, never wider than one-quarter-inch when
    finished. An eighth-inch is even more desirable. The narrower the binding,
    the smarter the edge finish. Wide bindings are amateurish and give a noticeable
    home-made effect.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/03_how-to-cut.jpg" alt="diagonal of bias marked on fabric" width="123" height="126" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />How to cut</h4>
  <p>Bias should always be cut on a <strong>true</strong> bias. Any variation from this rule ruins
    the effect. A true bias is the diagonal across the straight threads of the
    goods, joining two lines made at right angles along the straight threads,
    with the lines being of even length. It could be represented by a diagonally
    folded handkerchief.</p>
  <p>A &quot;near bias&quot; or a &quot;long bias&quot; is the diagonally cut
    material, but it is not a true bias and is often incorrectly used for the
    true bias. Better results will be secured if this long bias is cut into shorter
    strips of true bias and seamed together. The stretching properties are not
    the same on the near bias and it gives a poor effect.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/03_mark-bias.jpg" alt="triangle of fabric with true bias marked" width="132" height="89" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Mark the bias</h4>
  <p>It is unnecessary to use long strips for bias binding, smaller strips can
    be used to advantage, saving the larger pieces for possible use later. Straighten
    the material on the table, and if of a sheer fabric, pin it to a paper, straightening
    along the straight threads of the goods. Use tailor's chalk for marking,
    and mark the lines in long dashes. A long line cannot be chalk marked on
    thin material without ruffling the goods.</p>
<h4>  Cutting 'round
  and 'round</h4>
  <p>Cut bias carefully if the right effect is desired later. If a large section
    of true bias is available, it can be seamed together along the straight edge,
    making a circle of the goods. Cut with the scissor-cutting guide that slides
    over the point of the scissors.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/03_find-bias.jpg" alt="scrap of fabric with true bias marked" width="132" height="152" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Finding a
true bias</h4>
  <p>If an uneven piece of goods is to be used for bias, mark a right angle along
    the straight threads, one line on the lengthwise and one on the crosswise
    of the goods. Mark off on these lines an even amount of inches, the length
    depending upon the size of the goods. Now join these marks on the lines across
    the bias of the goods and a true bias will be found. Mark to the right or
    left of this line for the bias strips.</p>
  <h4>    Double and
single</h4>
  <p>Double binding is easier to apply than single. The double binding is cut
    one and a quarter inch wide, for the amateur. The more experienced sewer
    can cut it one inch wide. It is easier for the beginner to stitch a wider
    seam when sewing the binding to the dress and then trim off the seam before
    turning. Double binding can be used on material that is not heavy, such as
    thin silks or cottons. Single binding is cut three-quarters of an inch wide&#8212;a
    trifle wider for the beginner and is used on heavier material.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/03_trim-ends.jpg" alt="bias strips laid atop each other with clean diagonal marked for trimming" width="132" height="85" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Trim ends</h4>
  <p>When scraps are used to cut bias, the ends are not always on a straight
    thread of material, which is necessary for correct joining. If the material
    is striped, all the stripes should run in the same direction and if the stripe
    is on a diagonal the lines should cut the same.</p>
  <p>To match crooked seam ends of bias, overlap the stripes so that they will
    be placed in one long line. Slide the scissors under the two overlapped ends
    and cut along the straight thread of the goods. The two ends will now be
    perfectly matched.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/03_joining.jpg" alt="bias strips laid at right angles, with trimmed edges joined" width="132" height="151" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Joining bias</h4>
  <p>There is a trick in joining bias so that the edges will be straight after
    they are joined together. Place the strips together at right angles on the
    seam. <strong>Make a wide seam and match the pieces at the sewing line and
    not at the edge.</strong> It will be at the center of the small point made when the two pieces
    are placed at right angles to each other. When the strips are opened, the
    outer line will be straight if the pieces are of even width.</p>
  <p>It is advisable to stitch a wide joining seam as the seam must be pressed
    open and trimmed back later. It is impossible to press open a narrow seam.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/03_continuously.jpg" alt="multiple strips of bias laid out, ends joined with continuous stitches" width="132" height="134" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Stitch
continuously</h4>
  <p>When there are several strips to be joined for the binding, stitch continuously,
    stitching two strips together. Just as they leave the presser foot, slide
    two more strips under the presser foot for stitching. Be sure that the right
    side of the strip is used. After the seam leaves the machine it can be clipped
    apart. All the seams can be stitched in this manner. The seams are then all
    pressed open.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/03_trim-press.jpg" alt="stitched bias strip pressed and trimmed" width="132" height="154" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Trim and press</h4>
  <p>If the joining seam is wide, trim it off to a one-eighth seam after pressing.
    Then if the binding is a double binding, press it double along the full length
    of the strip, stretching the bias as it is pressed. This folded edge will
    be caught to the seam when finished.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">Machine stitch
    the neck</h4>
  <p>Sheer material
    should<img src="images/03_neck-a.jpg" alt="bodice joined at shoulder seams with arrow showing where to join bias at left side of neckline" width="132" height="107" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /> be stitched around the neck line and then tested to determine if it
    lies flat before the binding is applied. The tension should
    be rather loose so that the thread can easily be removed after the binding
  is stitched to place.</p>
  <p>When binding the neck, start the binding so that there will not be a joining
    seam of the binding at the center front. It is advisable to start the binding
    at the left side of the neck below the shoulder seam. Plan the binding so
    that the joining seams will miss all seams of the dress. Stretch the binding
    slightly when basting to an inner curve such as the neck.</p>
  <p class="clear"><img src="images/03_neck-b.jpg" alt="ends of binding joined" width="132" height="184" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />The ends of the binding must be joined when binding a neck. The seam must
    be on the straight thread of the binding and not cross-wise. Leave at least
    two inches loose when starting to apply the binding, and tack two inches
    before the end is reached.</p>
  <p class="clear">Overlap the two ends,<img src="images/03_neck-c.jpg" alt="overlapping ends of binding for v-shaped neck" width="132" height="109" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /> pin them together as they will be sewed and then trim
    off. Baste together and test to determine if the bias is the correct length
    to fill the space. Then stitch the joining seam and baste to the dress.</p>
  <p>If the neck is to be made into a point such as a V-shaped neck line, the
    binding will be applied as a straight line. After it is finished, the definite
    point will be made by holding the point together on the wrong side and tacking
    it by hand.</p>
  <h4>    No puckers </h4>
  <p>Do not depend upon removing puckers in binding by pressing. If it puckers
    when basted it is twisted and will continue to pucker when finished. It must
    be ripped off and rebasted.</p>
  <p>Puckered double binding is often the result of not using true bias or of
    using poor basting. The binding should be basted for the first stitching.
    It is turned and finished down with a slip stitch by hand without basting.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/03_attached.jpg" alt="arrows marking even spacing between stitching and folded edge of binding" width="132" height="99" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Attached</h4>
  <p>When machine stitching double binding to the dress, watch the space between
    the needle and the fold of the binding rather than the space between the
    needle and the raw edge. This is a universal mistake. It is more important
    to make the binding of uniform width than it is to make the seam even. The
    seam can be trimmed off later.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/03_finish.jpg" alt="double binding applied in two steps" width="132" height="151" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Finish a binding </h4>
  <p>It is not necessary to baste down the second turning of a double binding
    if it is to be hand finished. Trim off any loose threads and even the seam.
    Slip stitch the binding to place, sliding the needle into the fold of the
    binding and then catching a stitch of the machine sewing. This method will
    make the finish invisible.</p>
  <h4>    Single binding </h4>
  <p>Single binding is used when the material is too heavy for the double binding.
    After it is stitched to the edge, the seam is trimmed off on an even line
    as the hand finishing progresses, pushing under the raw edge with the needle
    as the edge is caught to the seam.</p>
  <h4>    Machine-stitched
finish</h4>
  <p>Double binding can be finished by machine if so desired, as in factory made
    dresses. This binding must be cut wider than the hand finished as it will
    extend beyond the seam.</p>
  <p>There are two methods of finishing. One is to press open the seam after
    attaching the binding; the other is to push the seam into the binding. The
    folded edge of the binding is then rolled over the edge and basted.</p>
  <p>If the seam is pressed open, the machine stitching is made in the seam itself.
    If the seam is pushed into the binding, the stitching is made below the seam
    and on the dress and not the binding. Baste from the right side to watch
    the finished width of the binding.</p>
  <p>When stitching on binding for the final finish with the seam pushed into
    the binding, it is sometimes easier to hold the bulk of the sewing under
    the arm of the machine or to right of the needle and thus stitch close to
    the binding. The stitching must be very close to avoid any semblance of a
    home-made effect. Some machines have an attachment or extra foot that makes
    it possible to stitch close to a ridge. This foot is excellent to use for
    this purpose.</p>
<h3>      <b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><a name="commercial" id="commercial"></a></i></font></b>Commercial Seam Binding</h3>
  <h4>    Cotton bias </h4>
  <p>Commercial bias binding can be purchased in all shades of cotton and in
    some shades of taffeta. The cotton binding is made in heavy and thin materials,
    some makes having the matching thread enclosed with the package. This is
    an advantage; all cotton binding is machine stitched on the binding on the
    right side, while bias binding made of self-material is not stitched on the
    binding but on the dress or is finished down by hand.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/03_binder.jpg" alt="pre-made bias strip with diagonal end, applied to edge of garment" width="132" height="137" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Binder</h4>
  <p>Cotton bias is sold ready to apply with the edges pressed under, and some
    is made that is folded double. The double fold can be applied with one stitching
    after some practice, especially with the sewing machine binder.</p>
  <p>Modern sewing machines have an attachment for bias that applies it with
    one stitching. To use the binder, it is necessary to trim off the edge of
    the bias to a sharp point and then push the point into the binder with a
    stiletto or long darning needle. After it is properly placed it is easy to
    apply.</p>
  <p>If the binder is not used, it is advisable to apply the binding with one
    or two bastings or with the first edge basted before it is turned and stitched.</p>
  <p>The beginner should baste all bias before stitching. It requires experience
    to stitch without basting. After basting place the seam on the table to be
    sure that it lies flat. If it does not lie flat, rip and rebaste.</p>
  <h4>    Curves </h4>
  <p>When sewing bias to inner curves it is necessary to stretch the bias slightly
    as it is being applied; when stitching to an outer curve, the binding is
    not stretched but may have to be held a trifle full.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/03_points.jpg" alt="folding edges of binding for v-shaped neck" width="132" height="140" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Points</h4>
  <p>Inner points that are to be edged with commercial bias should be clipped
    to the depth of the seam before the binding is applied. The point is then
    stretched out into a straight line as the binding is basted on. After the
    binding is finished, the point is caught on the wrong side as in a V-neck
    dress.</p>
  <p>Outer points that are to be finished with bias binding will have the binding
    stitched to the end of the point on one side. The binding will then be puckered
    under into a small dart to form a miter. The corner is then turned and the
    binding is continued down the other side.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/03_ribbon.jpg" alt="ribbon stitched to edge of garment" width="132" height="82" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Ribbon binding</h4>
  <p>Ribbon seam binding is generally used for inside finish of heavy materials
    and velvets. It is used for the finish of hems, plackets, and cuffs. The
    thin ribbon is flat stitched to the goods without turning the seam under,
    with the stitching on the edge of the ribbon. The top edge of the ribbon
    is then caught to place and the edges are not turned under.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/03_taffeta.jpg" alt="taffeta strip folded over edge and stitched" width="130" height="100" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Taffeta binding</h4>
  <p>Bias silk or cotton binding can be purchased to finish coat seams. This
    is applied similarly to binding cut from material. It is used for finishing
    the edges of unlined coats and curved edges. Coat seams are bound with the
    binding. It is opened on one edge, basted to the right side of the material,
    stitched to place, turned close to the seam edge, and then the remaining
    edge of the binding on the under side is opened and basted flat to the seam.
    The seam is turned to the right side and machine stitched in the fold of
    the goods, or directly below the binding and not on it.</p>
  <p>Satin or sateen can be cut into coat binding and can be applied in the same
    manner.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/03_piping.jpg" alt="piping applied, in two steps" width="132" height="146" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Piping</h4>
  <p>Piping is applied with no visible stitching as it is placed between the
    edges of the goods and is invisible when stitched to place. The following
    rules must be followed to be able to stitch it a uniform width unless one
    edge of the seam is flat stitched.</p>
  <p>Open the bias binding and baste double to one side of the seam only. Remove
    the bastings after stitching.</p>
  <p>Place the matching edge to the seam and stitch together, following the first
    line of stitching as a guide. This makes the stitching invisible and the
    piping even.</p>
  <p>    Corded piping Corded piping requires a special machine attachment for making
      as the seam must be close to the edge of the cord.</p>
  <p>Work out each step in samples.</p>

  <h3>    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><a name="facings" id="facings"></a></b></font>FACINGS</h3>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/03_facings.jpg" alt="stitching applied to neck front along curve" width="132" height="144" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Facings defined</h4>
  <p>Facings are sections of material that finish the edge without protruding;
    a binding extends beyond the edge.</p>
  <p>A facing can be made either wide or narrow and can be made on the wrong
    side as a finish or on the right side as a trimming. All facings wider than
    one inch, finished, should be termed a shaped facing and should be made as
    such.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/03_shaped.jpg" alt="vertical lines used to measure exact shape of irregular neckline" width="125" height="159" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Shaped, or fitted
facings</h4>
  <p>A shaped or fitted facing should be cut to fit the edge that is to be faced
    and should be <strong>cut on the exact thread of the material as the section
    that is being faced.</strong> This means that the lengthwise thread of the outer section
    must be matched perfectly with a lengthwise thread of the facing. Be careful
    not to confuse the crosswise thread with the lengthwise thread when cutting
    a facing, as the two will shrink differently and the garment will draw if
    the facing is not cut perfectly. It is advisable to piece the facing to be
    able to secure the correct thread of material.</p>
  <p>Fitted facings for hems, revers, neck lines, etc., should be carefully cut
    to prevent them from drawing.</p>
  <p>If the crosswise thread of the goods is to be used as a trimming, such as
    in striped or plaids, it is advisable to shrink the material before making.</p>
  <h4>    Piecing facings </h4>
  <p>When facings are pieced, be sure to make all joining seams on the lengthwise
    thread of material&#8212;never on the bias. The seam should be matched perfectly,
    pressed open and then tested to be sure that it is the correct shape before
    it is applied. Narrow facings can be made on a true bias.</p>
<h4>Fitted facings </h4>
  <p>Fitted facings such as collars, cuffs, revers, lined sections of peplums,
    drapes, flares and circular sections should be cut from the same pattern
    as the outer section, carefully watching the lengthwise thread.</p>
  <p>Study the instructions given in these lessons for <a href="#collars">making
      collars</a> and <a href="hsc-5.html#cuffs">cuffs</a>,
    as the facing is treated after it is cut and before it is applied.</p>
  <h4>    Edge seams
pressed open</h4>
  <p>The inner edge seam or joining seams of all facings should be pressed open
    before turning back. This will apply not only to straight edges but also
    all circular edges. If the seam is so joined that it will not lie flat when
    opened, then press back one side of the seam that has just been stitched,
    turn over and press back the other side.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/03_outer.jpg" alt="outer point of collar marked" width="132" height="98" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Outer corners
and curves</h4>
  <p>All outer corners must be clipped off before turning the seam and all right
    angles or less than right angles should be curved at the point rather than
    stitched to a true point so as to prevent the point from bulging. Outer curves
    should be clipped before turning.</p>

  <p>All inner curves, such as neck lines, should be clipped every inch before
    turning. All inner points must also be clipped to within two threads of the
    sewing line to be able to turn a perfect point.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/03_trim-facings.jpg" alt="facing trimmed to be slightly smaller than outer section" width="113" height="124" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Trim facings</h4>
  <p>All facings that are to be invisible, such as reverse facings, collars,
    etc., should be cut exactly like the outer section and <strong>then</strong> trimmed off one-eighth
    inch on the outer edges, which will be the joining seams when the smaller
    edge is held to match the larger edge. It will make the seam roll under and
    not protrude when finished, and the seam will be invisible.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/03_edge-finish.jpg" alt="edge of facing folded under and stitched" width="132" height="60" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Edge finish</h4>
  <p>All outer edges of under facings should be machine stitched with one turning
    before the facing is applied.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/03_fit-curves.jpg" alt="facing along curves" width="132" height="118" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Fit curves</h4>
  <p>If the facing is narrow and cut on a true bias, stretch the outer edge,
    as it is stitched in order to fit the curve of the neck or any similar curved
    section. If the facing is for the lower edge of a skirt and on the bias,
    hold in the outer edge when turning under so as to fit the inner curve of
    the hem. If the machine stitching is too tight it can be stretched, easing
    out the bobbin thread, if too loose, the bobbin thread can be drawn up. Press
    to shape before the final finish.</p>
  <h4>    Baste to place </h4>
  <p>After the joining edge is pressed open and the outer edge is machine stitched,
    baste the facing back along the finished edge and press.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/03_basing.jpg" alt="basting board tucked inside garment" width="125" height="122" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Basting board</h4>
  <p>Slide the basting board into the neck or front of the dress on the inside
    with the dress wrong side out. Flatten the facing against the dress and baste
    to place, basting a quarter of an inch back from the finished inside edge.
    Be sure that the facing lies flat and baste flat.</p>
  <p>The facing is now ready to be attached to the garment. Remove the basting
    board. Pick up the garment along the basting and hold the facing to the back
    with an eighth of an inch protruding at the top. The dress is then slip stitched
    to the facing back from the edge, sliding the needle into a fold of the stitched
    facing and then catching two threads of the dress. The stitches can be made
    far apart but they must be loose. The basting line should not be drawn tight,
    it is very loose. Back stitch every three inches. This loose basting will
    prevent the stitches from drawing and the back stitch will hold the loose
    stitches in place. (See directions for tailored hem.)</p>
  <p>    Tacked Some dressmakers prefer to catch the facing to the garment with several
      tackings. This is optional with the worker.</p>
  <p>Practice each problem in crepe paper.</p>

  <h4>Men's and women's
    garments close on
opposite sides</h4>
  <p>Garments for <img src="images/03_mens-b.jpg" alt="woman's garment fastening right side over left" width="130" height="172" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />men <img src="images/03_mens-a.jpg" alt="man's garment fastening left side over right" width="132" height="148" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />and for women close on opposite sides. Women's garments
  close to the left while men's close to the right.</p>
  <p>This custom has continued throughout the ages and originated in the ancient
    days when garments were held closed with the hands. A woman held her babe
    in her left arm and wrapped her mantle around it, leaving her right hand
    free to lead another child. The man carried his weapon on his left hip and
    wrapped his mantle to the right so as to leave his right hand free to quickly
    reach it. Hence the women's garments have continued to lap to the left and
    the man's to the right. All little girls and little boys clothes are also
    buttoned according to this rule.</p>
  <p>Back opening in dresses follow the same rule, the right side laps to the
    left. Buttonholes are on the right and buttons on the left of the opening.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">Spacing</h4>
  <p>Much of the smartness<img src="images/03_spacing-b.jpg" alt="single button marked on asymmetrical opening" width="132" height="134" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /> of the <img src="images/03_spacing-a.jpg" alt="button spacing marked at even intervals" width="132" height="143" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />garment depends upon the correct placement
    of the buttons and buttonholes. Crude spacing denotes amateurish efforts
    and produces a home-made effect. A row of tailored buttonholes and buttons
    is often the only trimming on the garment and they should be spaced carefully.</p>
  <p>If there are to be both buttons and bound buttonholes, the buttonholes are
    made first and the marks for placement of the buttons will be made through
    the buttonhole when the sides are overlapped flat on a table. The pin can
    be placed firmly when buttonholes are removed. Make the mark for the button
    at the front end of the buttonhole.</p>
  <p>Practically the same rule for spacing applies to buttons as to buttonholes
    except that the center of the button will be marked rather than the end as
    in the buttonhole. The center of the button will rest at the end of the buttonhole.</p>
  <h4>    Measure from
the edge</h4>
  <p> Place the button on the finished edge of the garment; the width of the
    button gives the mark for sewing. Place two buttons together resting on this
    mark,
    and the correct mark will be given for the space between the buttons. The
    larger the buttons, the wider the space. This space can be widened if desired
    but
  should not be narrowed.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/03_shank.jpg" alt="top view of button with pin tucked under thread to allow slack for shnk, and side view of shank being made" width="132" height="171" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Shank</h4>
  <p>The shank of the button connects the button with the cloth. The thicker
    the cloth of the buttonhole the longer the shank should be made. Some buttons
    are made with a metal shank while thread must make the shank on others. All
    buttons that are used to hold a buttonhole should be sewed to the garment
    with a thread shank as the tight stitching without the shank produces a drawing
    on the buttonhole. The button with a large shank requires that the buttonhole
    be placed closer to the edge.</p>
  <p>To make a thread shank, place a bar across the top of the button under the
    first thread. Use a pin, a needle, a darning needle or a match, depending
    on the depth of the shank desired. The match is used for men's coats. This
    crossbar holds the thread away from the button when sewing and when it is
    removed, this space will be under the button.</p>
  <h4>    Making the
shank</h4>
  <p>Take one stitch to hold the button down, slide the bar under the thread
    on top of the button. Take as many stitches as will be necessary to hold
    on the button; then remove the bar, pass the needle through the button on
    top of the goods on the right side of the garment. Wrap the thread around
    the threads under the button and then tack. When the thread is tacked, it
    will hold closer if each thread is knotted in this manner. After the loop
    is made, pass the needle through the loop and draw it up. Make three such
    knots before <strong>cutting</strong> off the thread. Do not break it, as the last two knots
    will loosen.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/03_coat.jpg" alt="button being applied with small button on reverse side of fabric" width="127" height="170" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Coat buttons</h4>
  <p>Coat buttons are often re-enforced with a second button sewed on the under
    side. This will prevent the outer button from pulling out the material. The
    button can then be sewed through both the lining and the material, otherwise
    the button is sewed through but one thickness of the goods.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    Men's buttons</h4>
  <p><img src="images/03_mens-buttons.jpg" alt="attached button without going through to facing" width="132" height="150" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Buttons sewed to a heavy coat without the small button on the wrong side
    must be sewed to place without the stitches going through the facing.</p>
  <p>Use heavy thread for heavy material. Linen thread should be used for men's
    coats. Take a stitch on the right side of the coat where the button will
    be placed, then run the needle through the button and down to the under side
    of the button. Take a small stitch on the goods under the button to hold
    it in place. Slide a match under this thread and over the button.</p>
  <p>Hold the coat over the finger with the button to one side and the under
    side of the button is visible. Take a stitch up over the button and down
    over the bar, then take a stitch <strong>across</strong> the goods under the button but do
    not catch the facing. Repeat this stitch until sufficient thread is over
    the button to hold it in place.</p>
  <p>Remove the match, pass the needle through to the under side of the button.
    Wrap the thread around it and tack as directed.</p>
  <h4>    Covered buttons </h4>
  <p>Buttons can be covered either by machine or by hand. Most department stores
    offer this service or will direct their customers to a reliable firm that
    offers this service. Material for the covering must accompany the order as
    these buttons are made of matching materials. Small scraps of material are
    sufficient as small circles are cut for the coverings.</p>
  <p>Molds for these buttons are furnished by the firm that makes them; they
    offer various shapes and sizes. They are usually used on tailored dresses
    made of satins and woolens. Heavy plain crepe is also trimmed in tailored
    buttons. They are often used as a trimming, being placed close together on
    slashed openings on necks and sleeves or a collar and front closing or in
    a close row down the sleeve. They are often made very small, closing with
    tailored loops.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/03_hand-covered-n.jpg" alt="circle of fabric with gathering stitch, gathered around button" width="123" height="182" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Hand-covered
buttons</h4>
  <p>A few larger buttons can be covered by hand. Cut a circle of material over
    twice the width of the button. Run a gathering thread around it, making the
    gathered circle larger than the button. Place the button in the center with
    the rounded side next to the cloth and draw up the thread. The ends of the
    cloth should be sufficiently long to hold in the hand as a stem.</p>
  <p>Sew back and forth across the under side of the button, gradually turning
    it until all the gathered portion is held firmly in place. Do not run the
    thread <strong>over</strong> the raw edges. This will be trimmed off later. When the stitching
    is firm, trim off the ends flush with the button and tack.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/03_snaps.jpg" alt="side view and top view of snaps" width="108" height="250" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />When
  to use snaps</h4>
  <p>Snap fasteners are used for invisible closings and are used on openings
    that have no strain. A waist may be closed at the side with snaps, but if
    there is no belt to relieve the strain there should be a hook and eye at
    the waist line.</p>
  <p class="clear">Snaps are made in several sizes both in black and white.<img src="images/03_snaps-a.jpg" alt="side view of male portion of snap applied to fabric" width="112" height="188" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /> They
    are placed close to the finished edge usually with the socket section on
    top. This is
    not a definite rule.</p>
  <p>Spaces for the snaps should be marked before sewing to place. The stem part
    is sewed on first, placing pins for the marks. Place the end snaps and then
    fill in the space evenly as closely as necessary.</p>
  <p>The thread is sewed over the sides, two stitches in each opening. Sew with
    heavy thread. Bring the needle up from under the snap at each opening. Tack
    securely.</p>
  <p>After <strong>all</strong> the stem sections are sewed to place, place the placket flat on
    the table and rub over the stems with tailor's chalk. Press down the stems
    hard against the matching seam and each matching section will be marked perfectly.
    Quickly place a pin on each small chalk mark before it disappears.</p>
  <p class="clear">The <img src="images/03_snaps-c.jpg" alt="metal bar, metal loop, and thread loop which can be used with hook" width="132" height="137" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />hook is <img src="images/03_snaps-b.jpg" alt="hook applied to edge of fabric" width="132" height="137" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />placed on the top part of the seam and is sewed back from the
    edge making it invisible. It is sewed to place around the ends of the hook
    and the top is also held to place with stitches. If several hooks are used,
    a small piece of ribbon can be slipped under them for a finish.</p>
  <p>There are two types of eyes that can be used; one is the metal eye that
    comes with the hook, or a thread loop can be made to use as the eye. The
    straight metal eye will be the most invisible of the metal eyes. The thread
    loop is made like a bar tack (see lesson on belts), or can be buttonholed.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/03_weights.jpg" alt="weights applied to cowl necklines" width="132" height="153" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Weights</h4>
  <p>Covered weights are used on cowl neck lines. Otherwise they are seldom used
    in the modern garments; for if a garment fits correctly, it is not necessary
    to hold it in place with weights.</p>
  <p>The weight for a cowl neck is covered with matching material. Sew up a long
    fold the size of the weight and four inches long. Turn and slide the weight
    into the fold. Tack it to place and then tack the end of the fold to the
    collar line of the dress. The weight will drop and hold the collar down.
    The folds of the cowl are tacked to the material of the covering.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/03_lingerie.jpg" alt="loop on inside of shoulder seam" width="132" height="102" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Lingerie</h4>
  <p>The woman with sloping shoulders finds it difficult to hold the lingerie
    straps in place. She will find that a pattern for the built-up shoulder or
    the shaped shoulder will be helpful. The straps must also be attached closer
    to the center front and the center back of the garments for this type of
    figure.</p>
  <h4>    Lingerie tabs </h4>
  <p>Lingerie tabs are also very helpful. Use ribbon seam binding or a folded
    selvage, two inches long. Sew the loose end to the dress shoulder seam and
    the fold end will have a snap sewed to it. The matching section of the snap
    will be sewed to the dress. The straps will slide under the tab.</p>

  <h3>    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><a name="collars" id="collars"></a></b></font>COLLARS AND NECK LINES</h3>
  <h4>    Too low </h4>
  <p>Neck lines are made in various designs, but they should often be modified
    to suit the type of individual who is to wear the garment. If the neck is
    low, it may be too low for some individuals, and if it is high it may be
    more becoming if it were made lower. The broad, round face should wear the
    V-shaped necks and should modify round necks so as to make the face appear
    longer rather than broader. The same is true of the long, thin face: the
    V-shaped necks should be raised to the rounder type and possibly have a collar
    added.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/03_cut.jpg" alt="bodice front with neckline marked below cutting line" width="101" height="162" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Cut cautiously</h4>
  <p>Be cautious when cutting a neck line. Cut the neck higher than indicated
    in the pattern and mark the pattern line, but do not cut it low. A neck line
    cut half an inch too low may ruin the appearance of the dress on the individual.
    It is always possible to cut out the neck later. Material can be cut off
    but it cannot be put on so easily.</p>
  <p>Neck lines and sleeves should harmonize. If the neck line has a collar,
    the edge of the sleeve should have a semblance of a cuff or cuff trimming.
    If the neck is bound as a finish, the edge of the sleeve is bound also. If
    the neck is faced, then the sleeve is also faced.</p>
  <h4>    Binding a
trimming</h4>
  <p>Binding is often used as a trimming when there is no definite neck finish
    in collars or drapes. When there is a collar or a partial collar in the front,
    back or at the sides, or when there is a draped or scarf effect, the neck
    and sleeves should be faced. The same finish will extend around the neck
    whether it is bound or faced. It will not be faced over the collar and bound
    over the open section.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/03_wide.jpg" alt="bodice front with self-cut facing" width="129" height="154" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Wide facings</h4>
  <p>When wide facings are flat stitched to the right side of the neck for a
    trimming, a similar trimming is often made on the sleeve. When a revers is
    faced, or a front facing applied, the facing extends under the fold for two
    inches, and is attached to the shoulder seam. This prevents the raw edge
    from being visible. The facing of a lapel will be on the right side of the
    garment when the fold is turned back. Remember this when cutting.</p>
  <h4>    Narrow facings </h4>
  <p>Necks and sleeves are often narrow, finished with facings. The wider facings
    are cut on the same thread of material as the outer section, while a narrow
    facing can be cut on a true bias. (See facings.)</p>
<h4>Collars </h4>
  <p>A collar usually rests at the bone in the back of the neck unless otherwise
    designed. This is especially true of the one-piece collar that opens in front.
    A back opening often drops lower. Individuals with short necks should avoid
    collar effects, for they shorten the neck. The woman with the long neck can
    even increase the width of the collar and make it stand higher.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/03_modification.jpg" alt="modification to roll collar" width="132" height="168" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Modification</h4>
  <p>A collar that rolls up at the back of the neck apparently decreases the
    length of the neck. This can easily be accomplished by a slight modification
    of the collar pattern. The collar will stand higher if the outer edge is
    decreased. Take a quarter-inch dart at the outer edge at the shoulder line
    of the collar pattern and pin this into the pattern. Do not reduce the neck
    size. The collar can be made to lie flat on short necks by slashing the pattern
    and spreading it a half inch at the shoulder line. It is always advisable
    to make a trial collar in muslin before cutting the material. Baste it to
    the dress and determine if it has the desired effect. The muslin can be changed
    and the material will cut from the altered muslin.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/03_match-thread.jpg" alt="collar facing with seam" width="132" height="136" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Match the thread</h4>
  <p>All collar facings should be cut on the same thread of material as the outer
    collar. The facing can be pieced if the material is not too thin. All joining
    piecing seams must be along the straight thread of material and all must
    be pressed open and the collar laid flat so that the two collars can be perfectly
    matched before being joined. Open the collars for testing. Do not measure
    from a half collar; it will not be a true test.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/03_loops.jpg" alt="tailored loops along collar front" width="126" height="128" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Loops</h4>
  <p>If the collar will have any tailored loops or any bound buttonholes at the
    edge they must be made before the facing is attached. In some tailored collars
    the bound buttonhole will be made on the facing, as this will be the outer
    section when worn. Test the placement before making.</p>
  <h4>    Thin material </h4>
  <p>Collars of thin material are faced with the collar facing cut exactly like
    the outer collar. The seam will then be exactly on the edge.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">Smaller facing</h4>
  <p>Heavy<img src="images/03_facing-b.jpg" alt="collar clipped along couter curve to stitch line" width="132" height="67" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /> material
    <img src="images/03_facing-a.jpg" alt="collar with stitch line" width="132" height="65" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />should have the under collar trimmed back at the outer edge before stitching.
    This will make the collar edge roll under and be invisible.
    Cut the two collars exactly alike, then trim off one-eighth inch on all outer
    seams. The neck seams remain the same. When the two collars are basted together
    the longer edge is held to the shorter edge and pinned together before basting,
    matching the centers. The edges will be held together when basting and the
    longer edge will be held in to the shorter edge, easing in the slight fullness.</p>
  <p>Stitch the seam at the edge and, if possible, press it open. Clip all inner
    corners and notch outer curves and corners. At least one side of the seam
    can be pressed back before turning under. After the collar is turned, baste
    along the edge and the seam will roll under the collar and be invisible from
    the front. Baste the collar edge and press flat.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/03_applied.jpg" alt="collar being applied to garment" width="131" height="139" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Applied</h4>
  <p>The collar should be finished complete before it is applied to the dress.
    The two edges at the neck are basted together and will be both basted to
    the dress. One side of the collar is not used for the finish. This makes
    a bulging seam under the collar and does not permit the collar to set smoothly.
    Even a standing collar should be finished in this manner.</p>
  <p>The collar is then basted to the dress and a separate facing is basted over
    it. This facing can be a narrow true bias cut one and a half inches wide
    or can be a fitted facing. This will make four thicknesses stitched at the
    neck line, the two collar edges, the dress, and the facing. Stitch to place,
    baste flat and finish. (See facings.)</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/03_slashed.jpg" alt="neckline with deep slash" width="120" height="113" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Slashed openings
at necks</h4>
  <p>A slashed opening at the neck requires special care when making. Any tailored
    loops must be made and applied before the facing is attached. The edge seam
    is stitched narrow, gradually narrowing the seam as it reaches the point
    until the seam at the point catches but two or three threads of the goods.
    The point will then be buttonholed with hand stitching to hold the seam firm.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/03_tailored.jpg" alt="tailored collar showing inside seams" width="132" height="128" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Tailored collars</h4>
  <p>Tailored collars and convertible collars are made differently from the regular
    set-on collar as just described. There will be a joining seam along the edge
    that must be smooth and flat. Many of the tailored dresses are made in this
    manner, and all notched collars and all coat collars are made this way. If
    tailored methods are not used on tailored garments a homemade effect will
    be produced.</p>
  <p>The collar described will be a simple coat dress with a straight collar
    stitched across the neck and turned back to form a revers. The coat collar
    will be a shaped section but will be applied in the same manner. The straight
    strip across the back of the neck is often used in dresses.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/03_sample-lesson.jpg" alt="garment showing inside of shoulder seam and collar neck seam" width="132" height="185" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Sample lesson</h4>
  <p>It is advisable to first make a sample collar and facing. Cut a sample of
    the front and back section to below the armhole line. Also cut a facing for
    both the front and back section. Cut two sample collars. The matching sections
    must be cut on the same thread of the material. Both collars should be cut
    on the same thread of the goods and must be perfectly matched. Join the shoulder
    seams of both the outer section and also of the facing. Baste one of the
    collars to each section.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    Joined</h4>
  <p>Be<img src="images/03_joined.jpg" alt="neckline seam joining collar and facing to garment" width="73" height="157" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /> sure to press open the seam at the neck line that joined the collar to
    the dress and facing. This pressing is often omitted. One side of this pressed
    open seam will be used later and it must be perfectly flat.</p>
  <p>The facing and collar is now ready to be attached to the other collar and
    to the dress. Slide the facing section over the dress section and baste the
    two collars together carefully, matching the center backs and the seam lines
    at the front. Baste all around the collar and down both sides of the front.</p>
  <p>If the collar is a notched collar as in a coat, the inner corners of the
    seams should be clipped off so that the seam can be pressed open and the
    points will not interfere with a true basting to the point. If they do not
    match, the basting should be ripped and the seams must be made to match.
    These seams will be basted together on the under side later.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    Press<img src="images/03_press-open-b.jpg" alt="reverse side of collar with understitching" width="122" height="184" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /> open
<img src="images/03_press-open.jpg" alt="collar with neck seam pressed open" width="118" height="158" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />the seam</h4>
  <p>This outer seam on the edge should be pressed open. If it cannot be fumed
    and pressed, press back one edge of the seam at a time. Then turn, baste
    at the edge and press again.</p>
  <p>The next step is important and is usually omitted by the home sewer. This
    is accomplished after the collar is turned. Pin the collar and facing together
    on the right side along the front neck seam to the shoulder, placing the
    pins on the collar side and parallel with the seam. This is the seam that
    joins the collar to the garment.</p>
  <p>Turn the under side of the seam outward by turning the facing back until
    the seam is visible. Sew the two raw seam edges together with hand sewing
    as close to the seam line as possible. This holds the two seams together
    and prevents them from slipping. Press flat.</p>
  <h4>    The back </h4>
  <p>The back of the neck will then be finished. This inside basting will be
    continued all around the neck, hand sewing the two seams together to make
    a flat seam. The outer edge of the facing will then be finished. (See rules
    for facings.)</p>
  <h4 class="clear">Pleat <img src="images/03_pleat-opening-b.jpg" alt="reverse side of collar with understitching" width="132" height="153" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />openi<img src="images/03_pleat-opening.jpg" alt="single front pleat, with collar attached" width="132" height="205" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />ng</h4>
  <p>Collars with a pleat opening in front are finished somewhat differently.
    Baste the two collars to place carefully, watching the center front mark
    on the pleat. The pleat will extend beyond the center front. This pleat will
    fold back and will form the facing of the pleat in front. The extended facing
    will remain open until the collar is basted to place.</p>
  <p>After the collar is basted to the neck line, matching it to the center front
    mark, fold back the facing on the mark of the pattern for the fold and baste
    it across the double edge and partly extending over the collar edge. The
    hem will also be turned back on the facing, turning it outward, as this facing
    will later be turned under. This will finish the edge of the facing visible
    at the neck. It should have no bias binding across it. The bias binding for
    the collar finish will now be basted over the front facing and around the
    neck line over the collar edge. Start the bias at the center front and not
    at the edge. It should cover the edge of the facing. (See illustration.)</p>
  <p>After the bias is also basted to place, machine stitch the neck line, starting
    at the front, stitching over the front facing, the bias and the collar edge.
    The neck line will then be clipped, and the facing and bias turned to the
    wrong side and basted at the neck line. The edge of the bias will then be
    turned under and either machine stitched all around the turned edge free
    from the neck before it is felled to place, or it can be slip stitched without
    the stitching. This bias must be narrow when finished, otherwise a fitted
    facing must be used.</p>
  <p>Experiment with paper collars.</p>

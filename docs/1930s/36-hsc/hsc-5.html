<h3><font
			face="Arial"><b><em><a name="general" id="general"></a></em></b></font>Tailoring</h3>
  <h4>Tailoring is easy </h4>
  <p>A coat or suit can be made as easily as a silk dress if these rules for
    tailoring are followed accurately. More time is required for pressing and
    marking sewing lines than in dressmaking, but if each problem is perfected
    as it is encountered, and the coat is made and assembled as herein directed,
    it can be easily made at home.</p>
  <h4>    Requires
accuracy </h4>
  <p>Tailoring requires more accuracy than dressmaking. All sewing lines must
    be marked, must be matched perfectly, basted closely, and stitched straight.
    The iron must be used frequently, pressing before basting, pressing before
    stitching and pressing after stitching. Haphazard methods that might be used
    in some dressmaking do not produce perfect results in tailoring.</p>
  <h4>    Modern tailoring </h4>
  <p>&quot;Dressmaker coats&quot; are coats made with softer lines, without the
    severe lines of mannish tailoring. The padded shoulders and fronts made of
    heavy tailor's canvas used years ago in all tailored coats are not used in
    modern tailoring. The padded bust forms are omitted and even if a thin piece
    of tailor's canvas is used down the front of the mannish tailored coats,
    or the buttonholes are worked by hand, a careful dressmaker can make these
    garments beautifully.</p>
  <h4>Learn to tailor
wool</h4>
  <p>Lessons on tailoring should be learned on woolen material. The same rules
    will apply to tailoring cottons, silks and linens, but the full effect of
    the accurate methods can better be applied to wool. It is the constant pressing
    that perfects tailoring, and as wool is easily pressed with perfect results,
    it is easier to tailor wool than any other material. The rules for pressing
    silk and velvet are quite different and if the pressing is not done perfectly,
    the garment will look homemade.</p>
  <h4>    Nap and pile </h4>
  <p>While the nap and pile material is not so difficult to sew, it does require
    extra precaution when cutting. Plaids and stripes must also be cut and matched
    carefully and should be sewed carefully to secure the desired effect. (See
    <a href="hsc-6.html">lessons on materials</a>.)</p>
  <h4>    Loose weaves </h4>
  <p>Loosely woven fabrics must also be handled more carefully as they will stretch
    on the bias and will fray out on clipped corners. Loose weaves should be
    well shrunk before they are made.</p>
  <h4>    Velvet </h4>
  <p>Tailoring velvet or velveteen should only be attempted after a coat has
    been made of wool and after the rules for pressing velvet are fully understood.
    (See <a href="hsc-1.html#press">lesson on pressing</a>.)</p>
  <h4>    Silk </h4>
  <p>A silk coat can usually be made according to the rules for dressmaking,
    but collars, cuffs, pockets and linings will be made and applied as in the
    rules for tailoring. The pressing will be as frequent but will be done differently.
    (See <a href="hsc-1.html#press">lesson on pressing</a>.)</p>
  <h4>    Pressing silk </h4>
  <p>Practice pressing silk on a sample. Some silks will water spot and the moisture
    must be used carefully. Place the seam or hem on the press board. Place a
    dry cloth over the seam to be pressed. Brush over this dry cloth with a sponge
    or small wet cloth, that has been wrung almost dry. Press the dry cloth over
    the seam. The small amount of moisture that will be absorbed into the dry
    cloth will be all that is necessary to press the seam or hem to a keen edge.
    If the first pressing does not press the edge flat, repeat the operation.</p>
  <h4>    Open the seams </h4>
  <p>All seams should be pressed open in tailoring unless the seams are to be
    flat stitched. If flat stitched, the seam is first stitched on the wrong
    side; it is then pressed to one side, is flat stitched from the right side
    and then pressed again.</p>
  <p>Bastings should always be removed after stitching and before the seam is
    either pressed open or pressed flat. Clip the threads of the basting and
    draw them out with closed scissors points or a safety pin. Do not use the
    needle to remove bastings as this will bend the needle and ruin it for straight
    sewing.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/05_shrinking.jpg" alt="puckered iron mark on corner of fabric" width="132" height="158" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Test for shrinking</h4>
  <p>All woolen material must be shrunk before it is made. The selvage must also
    be cut from the edges before shrinking. To test the material to ascertain
    if the material has been preshrunk, place one corner on the press board and
    place a wet cloth over it. Set the warm iron on the wet cloth and permit
    it to steam through to the wool. Lift the iron and cloth and see if the goods
    has shrunk around the iron mark. It will be drawn up at this spot if the
    goods needs shrinking. If it remains flat and smooth it has been preshrunk
    and is ready to use after the selvage is removed. (See <a href="hsc-1.html#shrink">lesson
    on shrinking</a>.)</p>
  <h4>Check the
pattern</h4>
  <p>Check the pattern to determine whether any adjustments are necessary. Carefully
    follow the pattern layout, unless the adjusted pattern makes it impractical.
    A safe rule to follow is to cut all sections of the pattern running in one
    direction. (See <a href="hsc-2.html">lesson on cutting intricate materials</a>.)</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/05_marking.jpg" alt="tailor's tacks used to mark sewing line" width="132" height="165" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Marking sewing
lines</h4>
  <p>All seams should be marked on the sewing line either with tailor's tacks
    or with dressmaker's tacks. The latter is quicker and easier to make and
    are made along a chalk line marked on the goods. (See <a href="hsc-2.html#marking">lesson
    on marking sewing lines</a>.)</p>
  <p>Use a double thread. Baste down the line to be marked, catching one close
    stitch; then skip a two-inch space and take another close stitch. Continue
    to the end of the line. Then clip all the long threads apart that are joining
    the stitches. (See <a href="hsc-2.html#practical">lesson on stitches</a>.)</p>
  <p>Be sure to open the seam on the side and not at the end. Open the seam so
    that these stitches are visible, then draw the seam apart one quarter of
    an inch and clip the threads apart. After the two edges are separated, clip
    off the long threads on the top of the goods. The short threads will remain
    in the material better than the long threads.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/05_mark-darts.jpg" alt="dart from shoulder to point of breast marked with tailor's tacks" width="107" height="176" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Mark darts</h4>
  <p>All inner sewing lines in tailoring must be marked. As wool is too heavy
    to crease-mark, it is advisable to thread mark. (See Series 2.) After the
    thread marks have been matched and pinned together in making a seam or dart,
    it should be chalk-marked before basting and stitching, marking with tailor's
    chalk and ruler.</p>
  <h4>    Mark all
sewing lines </h4>
  <p>Both sides of the coat must be made alike and perfect sewing lines must
    be followed. Therefore use a ruler or yardstick and chalk mark all sewing
    lines, and then thread tack. In tailoring, even more than in dressmaking,
    much of the success depends upon the accuracy with which the sewing lines
    are followed.</p>
  <h4>    Joining the
seams </h4>
  <p>Baste all portions as they lie flat on the table. Assemble the back of the
    coat complete if there are several sections. Match one seam over the other,
    carefully matching the sewing lines. Place the more bias section on top.
    Match the top and bottom of the seam and straighten the section to position
    and then pin before basting. Pin the top and bottom of the seam before the
    centers are pinned.</p>
  <h4>    Baste closely </h4>
  <p>Baste the seams together closely. Loose, wide bastings cannot be used in
    tailoring if accurate results are desired. If the material is heavy, use
    heavy basting thread. Remove the pins after the seam is basted.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/05_baste-darts.jpg" alt="dart from shoulder to point of breast basted" width="73" height="156" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Baste the darts</h4>
  <p>All darts should be pinned together before they are basted to prevent twisting.
    Place the front edge of the dart on the bottom as it is the straighter edge
    and the back edge on top as it is more bias. Start to pin from the bottom
    to the top, matching the sewing lines. It will be necessary to turn over
    the seam as the pins are placed to secure the correct placement. After the
    darts have been pinned and basted they are ready to stitch. Care must be
    taken to have the stitching without any wavering along the line. When it
    is a dart with perfectly straight lines, use a ruler and a piece of tailor's
    chalk to mark the sewing line, then stitch on the chalk line instead of on
    the basting line. (See <a href="hsc-2.html#darts">lesson on darts</a>.)</p>
<h3>    <b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><a name="lining" id="lining"></a></i></font></b>Coat Lining</h3>
  <h4>    Two methods of
    lining coats </h4>
  <p>The coat lining should be made while the coat is being made if the easiest
    method is desired. A lining can be set into the coat after it is made, but
    the method given in this lesson gives the quickest method, which is used
    in factories for women's coats, while the tailor uses the custom-made or
    hand applied method of setting in the lining <strong>after</strong> the coat is finished,
    which is also used on men's coats.</p>
  <h4>    Quick method </h4>
  <p>The coat is made complete and lining is made complete before the outer edges
    are joined. Two coats are actually made and then they are stitched together
    all around the outer edge. The outer coat is made complete with the sleeves
    set in and the collar attached and then pressed. The lining is then stitched
    to the front facing and to the back of the neck facing, the sleeves are set
    into the lining and the collar attached and then both coats are joined together
    all around the outer edges.</p>
  <h4>    Accuracy </h4>
  <p>This method of making coats is quicker than the custom-made method, but
    it requires great accuracy so that all seams can be joined perfectly on the
    inside. It cannot be used in a coat where the lining pattern differs from
    the pattern used for the outer fabric.</p>
  <h4>    Alterations
in both </h4>
  <p>Any alterations that might be made in the outer coat when fitting must also
    be made on the inner coat, which will be the lining. All seams must be made
    exactly alike.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/05_front-edge.jpg" alt="bodice front with reinforcing fabric" width="98" height="184" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Front edge</h4>
  <p>Coats made of thin or loosely woven material will require a reinforcement
    down the facing and on the collar. A light weight tailor's canvas is excellent.
    Heavy coat canvas is too heavy for ordinary use and is only used on the mannish
    tailored coats. Preshrunk, unbleached muslin may also be used if the light
    weight linen is not available. The reinforcing material is cut on the bias
    and is cut from the same pattern as the facing and collar.</p>
  <h4>    Baste to place </h4>
  <p>The reinforcement material is then basted to the coat side of the garment,
    catching it to the coat on the inner edge with long, <strong>loose</strong> stitches, catching
    but one thread of the wool, and back stitching the loose stitch every three
    inches to hold it in place. Also baste at the outer edge. The collar will
    also have the collar reinforcement basted to it on all sides and it will
    be held in place on all seams when the collar is joined to the coat. This
    will permit outer collar and facing to be free from the reinforcement when
    the two coats are made as the outer collar is on the lining. Do not confuse
    the reinforcement with the interlining, which is made differently and will
    be explained later.</p>
  <h4>    Intricate seams </h4>
  <p>All intricate seams should be joined as directed in tailoring. If the seams
    are angular or are difficult to join perfectly, it may be necessary to use
    the right side basting as directed in the <a href="hsc-2.html#right">lesson
    on this subject</a>. This basting
    will perfect any seam.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/05_right-side.jpg" alt="shaped side front held in position with right-side basting" width="132" height="181" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Right side
basting</h4>
  <p>Prepare the seam, basting the edge to the wrong side over the sewing line
    of one single thickness of material and pressing it flat. Place the seam
    to which it is to be joined on the table and arrange the prepared section
    over it on the right side and pin to place. Slip-stitch the seam from the
    right side, catching a thread of the under section and sliding the needle
    into the fold of the upper section. Tack at the points and corners so that
    it will be held firmly in place, and press well.</p>
  <p>Remove the first basting, turn to the wrong side, clip in any inner points,
    so the seam can be turned back, lift the creased seam and stitch on the crease.
    If flat stitching is to be used it will be flat stitched <strong>after</strong> it is stitched
    on the under side of the seam.</p>
  <h4>    Flat stitch </h4>
  <p>All seams that are to be flat-stitched are first stitched on the wrong side
    in a regular seam. The seam is then pressed over to the side indicated for
    the flat stitching and the ridges are pressed perfectly flat before the stitching
    is made. The thinner the material the closer to the edge the flat stitching
    is made unless otherwise designated in pattern. The flat stitching will be
    made through three thicknesses of the material and the seam is not pressed
    open.</p>
  <p>If the goods is quite heavy it may be necessary to loosen the top tension.
    After the flat stitching is completed, press the seam again with a wet cloth
    on the wrong side. All seams must be stitched and finished complete on each
    section before the side seams are joined.</p>
  <h4 class="clear"><img src="images/05_back-complete.jpg" alt="ck of coat showing side backs and center back; side front and center front showing pocket and buttonholes" width="130" height="186" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Back complete
    Front complete</h4>
  <p>Make the back of the coat complete, joining all intricate seams, making
    any darts, tucks or pleats. Join the back of the waist to the back of the
    skirt section if the back is in two parts. Press all seams and lay aside.</p>
  <p>Make all the front complete.</p>
  <p>Make all bound buttonholes (see <a href="hsc-3.html#bound">lesson on buttonholes</a>) and pockets (see
    <a href="#pockets">lesson on pockets</a>) before the front is joined to the back. Make all seams
    of the front section, pressing and flat stitching if directed in the pattern.
    The fronts should be finished complete to the final pressing before it is
    joined to the back or to the lining. If the coat requires an alteration,
    it is advisable to run a colored basting thread down the altered seams for
    a guide and then rip the coat apart and make as directed. All alterations
    made on the coat will also be made on the lining.</p>
<h3 class="clear">    <b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><a name="making" id="making"></a></i></font></b>Tailoring&#8212;Group II</h3>
  <h4>    <img src="images/05_bound.jpg" alt="scrap of cloth pinned over location of bound buttonhole" width="117" height="166" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Bound
buttonholes</h4>
  <p>Bound buttonholes are made of the same material as the coat and should be
    made in the coat before the lining is applied. It is advisable to make a
    sample buttonhole first. The binding material is cut on the lengthwise thread
    (the selvage down the long side of the material). Cut the scrap at least
    an inch longer and at least three inches wider than the buttonhole.</p>
  <p>Mark the line for the buttonhole with chalk and then baste with small stitches
    along this line, as the stitching will be made from the wrong side; but the
    scrap is placed on the right side of the goods. Pin the scrap to the right
    side, evenly spaced over the basted line, with an equal portion on each side
    and at each end. (See complete <a href="hsc-3.html#bound">lesson on buttonholes</a>.)</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/05_stitch.jpg" alt="bound buttonhole stitched and snipped" width="112" height="110" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Stitch</h4>
  <p>Stitch the width of the binding according to the thickness of the material.
    Thin material may be made with the edge but an eighth of an inch wide, heavy
    material may be a quarter inch but not wider. Gauge the stitching from the
    center line; stitch to the corner, lower the needle into the goods, raise
    the presser foot and turn the goods, lower the foot and <strong>count the
    stitches across the end.</strong> Three to five stitches are sufficient. The end stitches should
    touch the basted mark for the buttonhole, Repeat the perfect corner stitching
    continuing down the outer side and then count the stitches across the other
    end. This is important.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    Turn and press</h4>
  <p>Slash the <img src="images/05_turn-press-c.jpg" alt="lining and facing stitched at outer edges" width="85" height="165" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />center<img src="images/05_turn-b.jpg" alt="bound buttonhole stitched and snipped" width="86" height="173" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /> line<img src="images/05_turn-press.jpg" alt="bound buttonhole stitched and snipped" width="132" height="127" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /> leaving a point of goods at each end. Pull the goods
    through the slot and <strong>press</strong> out the opening, making perfect corners. This
    is one of the secrets of perfect buttonholes.</p>
  <p>Then bring up one edge to fill half the opening and press it flat with moisture.
    Bring up the other edge to fill the complete opening. Turn to the under side
    of the binding, lift the corners, and stitch across the point; trim off.
    (See complete instructions for bound buttonholes.) After the buttonholes
    are made the coat can be attached to the lining.</p>
  <p>Unless there is a special pattern for the lining, use the front section
    of the coat pattern to cut the front of the lining. Cut off the width of
    the facing, allowing for the seam. Then use the remaining portion of the
    front pattern for the silk lining. Join the facing to the lining and press
    the seam flat but not open, pressing over the silk edge but not the wool
    edge.</p>
  <p>Match the complete front of the lining to the complete front of the coat
    before the side seams are joined. They should match perfectly on all edges
    as the seams will later be sewed together on the inside of the coat.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/05_back-lining.jpg" alt="placement of back lining, cut larger at top" width="132" height="190" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Back of lining</h4>
  <p>The back of the lining must be cut larger through the center back to prevent
    a drawing through the shoulders. When a special lining pattern is provided,
    follow the instructions accompanying it. Otherwise, use the same pattern
    as the coat back; place it off the fold of the material, one-half inch at
    the neck and slope it so that the lining is the same width as the outside
    at the hem. Press the extra amount over the edge of the pattern into a fold.
    This will be set into the coat as a fold.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/05_facing-back.jpg" alt="back facing at collar" width="99" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Facing in the
back</h4>
  <p>The lining will wear better if a wool facing is flat stitched to the lining
    at the back of the neck. This facing can be cut from the back pattern if
    a pattern for this section is not furnished. It should be cut the same width
    on the shoulder seam as the end of the front facing. It is machine-stitched
    around the raw edge of the curve; the edge is turned under and basted flat.
    It is then pinned and basted and flat stitched to the silk lining that was
    made with the extra fold in the center. The silk can be trimmed from under
    the facing after stitching.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/05_stay-tape.jpg" alt="stay tape stitched to armholes and neck edges" width="132" height="170" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Stay tape for
armhole</h4>
  <p>A stay tape is now stitched to the upper edges of the front and back of
    the coat at the sleeve-seam and around the neck. This should be stitched
    to the wrong side of the goods and should be a narrow thin preshrunk tape
    (one quarter-inch wide). This tape will prevent the armhole from stretching
    and will hold it firmly in place. It will also be stitched around the armhole
    of the set-in sleeve after the shoulder seam is joined.</p>
  <h4>    The sleeve </h4>
  <p>The epaulet or raglan sleeves should now be basted to the body extending
    the seams to the neck. The seams are pressed open or are pressed downward
    and flat-stitched as directed.</p>
  <h4>    Pockets </h4>
  <p>All pockets must be made before the lining is applied. (See <a href="#pockets">lesson
    on pockets</a>    in this series.)</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/05_shoulder-seam.jpg" alt="dart from shoulder to breast point, sewing and clipped" width="108" height="140" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Shoulder seam</h4>
  <p>The shoulder seams must be joined, for the set-in sleeve, before the collar
    is attached. The shoulder darts have been basted, stitched and pressed, trimmed
    off and the seam has been pressed open, pressing any pucker at the end of
    the dart flat. (See <a href="hsc-2.html#darts">lesson on darts</a>.) The front
    shoulder seam is usually cut a trifle narrower than the back seam. The ends
    of the seam are matched and
    pinned at the sewing lines, working with the back seam uppermost. After the
    two ends are pinned, then the seam is matched at the sewing line, pinned,
    basted and stitched. The seam is then pressed open.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    Dart<img src="images/05_dart-b.jpg" alt="placement of shoulder dart in lining" width="132" height="158" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /> in<img src="images/05_dart-a.jpg" alt="placement of shoulder dart in lining" width="91" height="181" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /> lining</h4>
  <p>The front dart must also be placed in the lining. It is basted in but is
    not stitched; the basting is removed when the coat is finished. Tuck the
    dart to the front, do not open the dart by cutting. The shoulder seam of
    the lining will be stitched across the shoulder dart as it is basted, pinning
    and matching the back seam as directed. The back neck facing has been flat-stitched
    to the back of the lining as directed and the edges of the two narrow portions
    of the wool facing at the shoulder seam should match.</p>
  <p>The under-arm seam remains open on both the coat and the lining until the
    collar is stitched to place. If the sleeve is an epaulet or raglan shoulder,
    the sleeves are set into both the coat and the lining to make the neck line
    complete. All seams are pressed open or flat-stitched while the under-arm
    seam remains open.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    The collar</h4>
  <p>The collar<img src="images/05_collar-a.jpg" alt="collar joined to neck edge, with side seams still open" width="132" height="165" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /> is now applied, matching it to the center back. The under collar
    is basted to the coat and the outer collar is basted to the facing and lining,
    as this collar will roll over and be on the outside when it is finished.
    The collar lengths should be exactly the same. After the two collars are
    carefully matched and basted to place, they are again measured, then stitched,
    and the seam is pressed open. If the collar is a notched collar as in the
    mannish coats, be sure to allow for a seam at the notch. If the inner curve
    is clipped into the sewing line at the notch while the material is still
    on the pattern, this seam allowance would be noticed and would not be forgotten.</p>
  <p class="clear">When<img src="images/05_collar-c.jpg" alt="undercollar, undercollar with stitching line, and stitching on neck edge down center front  of front of garment" width="132" height="178" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /> making <img src="images/05_collar-b.jpg" alt="collar attached to neck edge, with arrow pointing to notch point" width="132" height="155" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />a notched collar, it is advisable for the amateur to baste over
    the seam and press both points of the notch and trim off the points before
    the two collars are joined. It will make the joining easier as the sewing
    lines will be perfectly marked.</p>
  <p>The under collar should be smaller than the outer collar on woolen fabrics
    so that the seam will roll under when finished and will make the edge seam
    invisible. (See <a href="hsc-3.html#collars">lesson on collars</a>.) The under collar is trimmed off one quarter-inch
    around the outer edges. Notched collars will not only be trimmed on the outer
    edge but will also be trimmed off at the notch on the facing, gradually diminishing
    the trimming to nothing at the neck line. The seam will be trimmed from one-eighth
    to a quarter inch, depending upon the weight of the material. The thicker
    material will require the quarter-inch trim, while the thinner material will
    only need one-eighth.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/05_join-collars.jpg" alt="collar sewn to neck, with arrow pointing to front edge of seam" width="115" height="194" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Join collars
to coat</h4>
  <p>Join the outer collar to the facing and the under collar to the coat along
    the neckline. Both these seams will then be pressed open. This is a step
    that is always required in good tailoring and is so often omitted. If this
    seam is not pressed open a bulge will develop when the two collars are placed
    together and the effect will be quite &quot;home made.&quot; Press the seams
    to a keen edge and do not trim off the seam, as one side of the seam will
    be used later to hold the two collars together on the inside of the coat.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    Straighten
the seam</h4>
  <p><img src="images/05_straighten.jpg" alt="seam, pressed, showing stitching is uneven" width="132" height="155" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />The under-arm seam will now be joined, placing the seams flat on the table.
    Place the back on the bottom and lay the front sections over it. Pin the
    seams to place and then baste carefully, matching the sewing lines as marked
    or altered. Baste the same seams on the lining.</p>
  <p>For light weight wool, place the side seam on the press board, flatten the
    seam to one side and press the seam on the coat with a damp cloth. This will
    give a perfectly straight line to follow for the stitching. Lift the creased
    seam and stitch on the crease on both the lining and the coat, then press
    the seam open. Heavy wool, satin and velvet should have all seams chalk-marked
    with a ruler before stitching.</p>
  <h4>    Armhole stay </h4>
  <p>The armhole is now stayed with a narrow tape, or it can be stayed before
    the underarm seam is joined. This stay will hold the armhole in shape and
    will prevent the seams from bursting when the coat is worn.</p>
  <h4>    Set the sleeve </h4>
  <p>Set the sleeve into the armhole according to the pattern notches. A quick,
    easy method of setting sleeves without gathers is given in the <a href="hsc-4.html#sleeves">lesson
    on sleeves</a>.</p>
  <h4>    Tailored
sleeve cap </h4>
  <p>If a mannish coat is being made, the fullness around the sleeve cap must
    be shrunk out before the sleeve is set. Place two rows of gathers around
    the sleeve cap a half-inch apart. Draw up the gathers and tack to the size
    of the armhole. Turn the sleeve wrong side out; slide the cap over the small
    end of the press board. Place a wet cloth on it and press shifting the gathers
    until all the fullness disappears.</p>
  <h4>    The stay </h4>
  <p>A tape stay should be basted and stitched all around the edge of the coat.
    Baste and stitch the tape to the wrong side of the seam so it will remain
    in the coat. The edge stitching will be made on one edge of the tape and
    on the sewing line.</p>
  <h4>    Work with both
coat and lining </h4>
  <p>When the sleeves are set into the coat they should be set into the lining
    also. When the collar facing is attached to the coat, the collar is attached
    to the lining. This method will often prevent errors when alterations are
    made. If any alteration is made on the outer coat, the same amount should
    also be altered on the lining.</p>
  <p>If the coat is to be interlined, this is done before the lining sections
    are joined. (See <a href="#interlining">lesson on interlining</a>.)</p>
  <h4>    Two coats </h4>
  <p>There will now be two perfectly matched coats&#8212;one, the outer coat
    with the collar facing attached and the other will be the lining with the
    facing and outer collar attached. (See other lessons.) They will now be joined
    around the outer edges.</p>
  <p>Do not spare the pressing. Good tailoring requires much pressing. Each section
    should be finished and pressed complete before the next step is taken. The
    pressing not only perfects the work and makes the next step easier but also
    gives a finished effect which is encouraging as the work progresses.</p>
<h3 class="clear">    Reinforcement</h3>
  <h4>Reinforcement
    <img src="images/05_reenforce-b.jpg" alt="back bodice showing reenforcement along armholes, shoulder, and neck, and along bottom" width="132" height="174" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />versus <img src="images/05_reenforce-a.jpg" alt="bodice front showing reinforcement along armhole, shoulder, front, and bottom" width="121" height="202" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />inter
lining</h4>
  <p>The terms interlining and reinforcement are often confused. The interlining
    is used to make the coat heavier and is stitched in with the seams of the
    lining, while the reinforcement is the tailor's canvas or preshrunk unbleached
    muslin that is stitched to the wool material to make the edge firm.</p>
  <p>A medium weight unbleached muslin is preshrunk thoroughly, wetting it and
    pressing it when almost dry. If tailor's canvas is used, it should not be
    any heavier than the muslin. The heavy canvas is only used for the mannish
    tailored coats. The canvas does not require shrinking.</p>
  <p class="clear">All the edges of loosely <img src="images/05_reenforce-e.jpg" alt="sleeve, showing reenforcement along cuff" width="132" height="206" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />woven<img src="images/05_reenforce-d.jpg" alt="bodice showing stitching of reinforcement along armhole, shoulder, and front" width="132" height="153" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /> material,<img src="images/05_reenforce-c.jpg" alt="sleeve, showing reenforcement along sleeve cap" width="76" height="199" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /> such as light weight tweed, should
    be reinforced; the front edge of the jacket or coat, the neck, the complete
    armhole and the lower edge of the coat or jacket. The cap of the sleeve should
    also be reinforced, as well as the lower edge of the sleeve. The fullness
    at the cap of the sleeve should be gathered twice and shrunk out (see <a href="hsc-1.html#shrink">lesson
    on shrinking</a>) before the bias strip of muslin is basted to the V-shaped cap.
    All collars and cuffs are also reinforced.</p>
  <p>All reinforcing material should be cut on the bias, two to three inches
    is usually sufficient. Place the wool section on the muslin with the longest
    section on the most bias part of the goods. Cut off the exposed edge, remove
    the wool and cut off a three-inch width following the shaped edge cut from
    the wool.</p>
  <p>The muslin is then basted to the wrong side of the edge for which it was
    cut. It is basted to place with the material resting flat on the table. Machine
    stitch the outer edge close to the sewing line and just outside of it. This
    reinforcement will be caught into the seam of the wool.</p>
  <p>After the edge is stitched the raw edge is then trimmed off as closely as
    possible to the seam, only about an eighth of an inch remaining. The loose
    edge is then caught loosely to the wool with thread of a matching color.</p>
  <h3 class="clear">Tailoring&#8212;Group III</h3>
  <h3><b><em><a name="joined" id="joined"></a></em></b>Lining and Coat Joined</h3>
  <h4>      Join the two
    coats </h4>
  <p>The outer coat will be placed on the table right side up with the wrong
    side next to the table, the sleeves will also be turned wrong side out.</p>
<h4>    <img src="images/05_join-edges.jpg" alt="front, showing lining joined along front edge" width="98" height="196" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Join the edges</h4>
  <p>Place the lining coat over the outer coat and push the lining sleeves into
    the coat sleeves, then pin the two coats together at the center of the back
    of the collar. Pin all joining seams of the collar. They should be perfectly
    matched. Slide the basting board under the edge of the coat and pin; then
    baste the long coat facing to the coat edge, making the edges match perfectly.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    Join the collars</h4>
  <p><img src="images/05_join-collars-b.jpg" alt="lining stitched to front edge and along collar" width="117" height="170" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />The two outer edges of the collars will now be joined together. Match the
    center backs and pin, then match any points and seams. Ease the larger collar
    to match the smaller collar, pinning and basting from the side of the larger
    collar or from the facing side of the coat. Carefully watch the sewing lines,
    as the wider seam allowance will be followed when basting. Some of the original
    seam allowance has been trimmed off the under collar. The original seam on
    this piece is ignored. Make all seams equal width.</p>
  <h4>    Baste the coat
edge </h4>
  <p>The long coat edge down the front should be matched, pinned and basted flat
    on the table or on the basting board. If the back and front sections of the
    lining and coat match perfectly the outer edges should match.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/05_press-open.jpg" alt="facing joined to collar and front, and seam pressed open" width="132" height="164" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Press open edge</h4>
  <p>After the collar edge is stitched and the facing is joined, this seam must
    be pressed open. This is an important step and is usually omitted. A perfect
    edge cannot be turned unless the seam is pressed open, and the seam cannot
    be pressed open if it is trimmed off before it is pressed. If the corner
    is small and it is difficult to turn it and press the seam open, one side
    of the seam can be pressed back, as it remains wrong side out. Press one
    edge back; then turn the material over and press the other edge back. If
    the seam can be opened out it will be easier to press it flat.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/05_trim-off.jpg" alt="collar edges clipped and notched" width="115" height="68" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Trim off</h4>
  <p>After the seam is pressed open it can now be trimmed off to one-quarter-inch.
    If the collar is curved, clip the edges with notches so that the turned seam
    will not develop a bulk at the edge. Clip off all outer corners and clip
    in all inner points, then turn the edge and baste flat.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/05_hem-allowed.jpg" alt="sleeve cuff with hem allowance" width="75" height="129" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Hem allowed
on sleeves</h4>
  <p>Coat sleeves usually have a hem allowance of about an inch and a quarter
    for a hem, which is turned up without a seam at the edge. Even if the coat
    has a cuff, the sleeve is hemmed and the cuff is finished complete and then
    applied. Hems are also allowed on loose coat sleeves unless the lower edge
    is curved or shaped. A fitted facing is then used as a finish.</p>
  <h4 class="clear"><img src="images/05_reinforcement.jpg" alt="inside of sleeve showing reinforcement along wrist" width="72" height="136" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Reinforcement</h4>
  <p>If the sleeve at the wrist will not be finished with a cuff, the edge should
    be reinforced with a two-inch bias strip of thin tailor's canvas or a preshrunk
    bias of medium weight, unbleached muslin. This is applied <strong>after</strong> the sleeve
    is sewed together. Crease back the lower edge of the coat sleeve to determine
    the exact sleeve length. Turn the sleeve to the wrong side and baste this
    strip on to the wrong side of the sleeve, using thread that matches the coat
    goods, as the stitches will remain in the coat. Baste the lower edge of the
    strip to the edge of the crease, not the sleeve edge, basting to the coat
    side and not the hem side. Hold the muslin rather close, stretched slightly,
    as it is basted over the heavy material and when it is turned it will be
    <strong>under</strong> it and should be smaller. Overlap the ends on the straight thread of
    the muslin and not on the bias. Catch to the seams of the coat. Leave the
    top edge free. Turn the hem back over the muslin and catch to place with
    loose stitches before the lining is brought down and over it.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">Wrist of<img src="images/05_mannish-b.jpg" alt="sleeve with cuff, and inside view of reinforcement at wrist" width="128" height="182" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />    mannish<img src="images/05_mannish-a.jpg" alt="side view of sleeve showing stitching down along wrist  placket" width="67" height="188" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /> coats</h4>
  <p>The wrist finish of a mannish tailored coat has a simulated opening on the
    back edge. Extra material is allowed on the pattern to finish this opening.
    When the back seam of this sleeve is basted, baste to the edge of the sleeve
    and across this extra material. It is advisable to chalk mark this line for
    basting, continuing the line of the side seam. This basting will later be
    removed but is necessary for perfect tailoring.</p>
  <p>The sleeve seam will then be stitched as directed in the pattern, stitching
    around the edges of the extra fold. Turn the sleeve right side out and press
    up the hem, making a crease at the edge of the turning. Use a wet cloth for
    pressing. Turn the sleeve wrong side out and baste in the reinforcement as
    directed. If the material is heavy, some of the surplus material of the pleat
    can be trimmed away on the wrong side from the under part of the hem only.
    The buttons used on this sleeve are sewed through both edges of the fold
    but not the lining. Remove the basting at the edge when finished.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/05_applied.jpg" alt="cuff being applied to sleeve" width="84" height="149" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Applied cuffs</h4>
  <p>All cuffs that are made on woolen coats should be made separate from the
    coat. The sleeve edge is finished with a hem and without any reinforcement.
    The cuff is made complete and is slip-stitched to the coat edge, usually
    dropping a trifle below the sleeve edge. Fur cuffs are often made larger
    than the sleeve at the wrist and are caught only at the seam. (See <a href="#cuffs">lesson
    on cuffs</a>.)</p>
  <h4 class="clear"><img src="images/05_pockets-a.jpg" alt="pocket attached on inside to the lining" width="90" height="98" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Pockets</h4>
  <p>Slot pockets, which are often made on tailored short coats, are made similar
    to a bound buttonhole. Tailored pockets with a welt are also easily made.
    The lower side of the pocket material is lifted and pressed to fill the opening
    with the top section pressed down over it. (See complete <a href="#pockets">lesson
    on pockets</a>.)</p>
  <p class="clear"><img src="images/05_pockets-b.jpg" alt="cuff being applied to sleeve" width="92" height="193" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Patch pockets are lined and made complete before they are applied to the
    coat. All pockets are made before the front of the coat is attached to the
    back or the lining is joined. If a pocket is desired in the lining of the
    coat, it should be made and set in before the lining is attached to the coat.
    One side of the pocket opening is attached to the lining and the other side
    to the coat. (See full directions in <a href="#pockets">lesson on pockets</a>.)</p>
  <h4>    Join edges </h4>
  <p>After the outer coat is complete with the facing of the collar attached
    and the lining is complete with the outer collar attached, the two coats
    are placed on the table and the collar edges carefully pinned together, then
    pinned down the front and basted. After the edge is stitched straight, <strong>the
    seam if pressed open</strong> before the coat is turned and basted all around the
    edge. After the edge is finished, the lining seams and the coat seams are
    attached on the inside of the coat by reaching up into the coat and drawing
    them out, after they are pinned from the right side.</p>
<h3 class="clear">    Joining Lining Seams to Coat Seams</h3>
  <h4>    <img src="images/05_neck-lines.jpg" alt="arrows pointing to seams  where collar joins neck" width="132" height="96" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Seams of neck
lines joined</h4>
  <p>The neck line seam of the coat must be joined to the neck line seam of the
    lining on the wrong side of the coat. Fasten the seams together at the neck.
    Bring the neck line of the facing, matching the two opened seams, face to
    face and pin together along the full length of the seam matching the centers.
    The two protruding edges of the seams, which will be the lower edge of each
    seam, will now be sewed together by hand with heavy thread on the wrong side.
    This step is most important and is usually omitted, permitting the collar
    and lining to slide out of position and producing a &quot;home made&quot; appearance.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/05_back-armhole.jpg" alt="arrows pointing to back of armhole" width="100" height="150" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Back of armhole</h4>
  <p>The back of the armholes of the coat are now attached to the back armholes
    of the lining. The shoulder seam is matched and the under-arm seam is matched.
    The armholes are then matched between these two points, hand-sewing the two
    opened seams face to face, sewing the back part of the edges. They will be
    perfectly matched and lapped with one seam on top of the other. Join the
    seams of both sleeves from the inside between the two coats.</p>
  <h4 class="clear"><img src="images/05_sleeves.jpg" alt="side view of sleeve with seam stitched" width="99" height="188" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Sleeves seams
attached</h4>
  <p>The sleeve lining will now be attached to the lining of the coat on the
    wrong side at the under-arm seam. The sleeve lining and coat are wrong side
    out. The sleeve seam is pinned to the coat seam of the sleeve working from
    the armhole downward. When the elbow is reached a half-inch fold is made
    in the lining of the sleeve seam and attached to the coat seam to make the
    lining looser than the coat. The two seams are then joined to within three
    inches of the wrist. The seams are joined as they are pressed open.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    The wrist </h4>
  <p>After the seams are joined, reach into the sleeve from the coat side and
    turn it wrong side out. Finish the hem as directed and turn under the lining
    one inch from the edge and catch to the hem of the sleeve.</p>
<h4>    <img src="images/05_side-seams.jpg" alt="side seams of coat and lining" width="132" height="156" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Side seams</h4>
  <p>The side seams of the coat and lining should now be joined together. Place
    the coat on the table with the lining uppermost and with the right side of
    the lining out. Place a row of pins down the side seams on the front edge
    of the seam, slightly stretching the seam of the coat and not the lining
    seam, so that the lining seam will be looser than the coat seam.</p>
  <p>After the full length of the seam is pinned together reach up into the back
    of the coat and draw out this seam from the armhole. Sew the two back edges
    of the seam together to within six inches of the hem. Repeat on the other
    side seam.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">The hem</h4>
  <p>The <img src="images/05_hem-b.jpg" alt="lining and facing of coat hemmed" width="120" height="202" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />length<img src="images/05_hem.jpg" alt="hem marked on coat and facing" width="113" height="203" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /> of the coat should now be marked, and the lower edge of the facing
    should be pinned to the coat while it is on the figure. Place the pins along
    the edge of the hem. The coat is then removed and placed on the table. The
    edge of the hem is basted across the front facing, basting the facing to
    the coat as it hangs open. Place the coat on the press board, lining side
    up, and bring the hem of the facing and coat over the lining and press. This
    will make a crease for a perfect hem across both the facing and the hem and
    will prevent the facing from dropping below the hem line of the coat. Remove
    the basting, turn the facing back to the wrong side and baste the edges together,
    matching the creases, then machine stitch or hem straight across. If the
    material is heavy the facing should then be trimmed back to a seam's width.
    If the material is light weight, the hem can be creased up on this line and
  finished as a hem, then caught at the edge across the opened facing and coat.</p>
  <p>The coat hem can be cross-stitched or slip stitched to the coat without
    turning under the edge at the hem, if the lining is to be attached to the
    coat at the hem. If the lining is to be free of the hem, then the hem will
    be finished with ribbon seam binding and the lining will be hemmed and caught
    to the coat at the side seams.</p>

  <h4>      <img src="images/05_facing.jpg" alt="facing from yoke of back down to bottom of center front" width="129" height="180" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Facing</h4>
  <p>Coats made without a lining should have the facing or a partial lining extend
    to the underarm seam for a depth of two inches at the under-arm curve. The
    back will also be lined to this depth. This facing and lining will be made
    of the same material as the coat, or can be extended from the regular width
    of the facing with lining material. In this case the lining material will
    also be used for the back facing below the two-inch material facing at the
    neck in the back. This will join to the shoulder seams of the front facing.
    The wool material of the facings will be flat-stitched to the lining as directed
    for the neck facing at the back in the lining.</p>
  <h4>    Seam finish </h4>
  <p>The hem of the unlined coat is finished with binding. The seams are bound
    either with bias seam-binding or the bias binding may be made of lining material,
    as all the seams must be finished. The binding made from the material offers
    a wider width with which to work and is easier to handle.</p>
  <h4>    The hem </h4>
  <p>The hem of the coat is hung, pressed back and made perfectly flat with no
    darts or gathers. (See <a href="hsc-4.html#hems">lesson for making hems</a>.) Mark off an even width and
    baste the binding to the hem with the basting board or magazine placed between
    the hem and the coat.</p>

  <p>A coat will be given more body and more warmth if an interlining is added.
    This can be made of cotton flannel or thin interlining wool. The latter is
    preferable as it gives more warmth with less bulk. Thin cotton flannel is
    excellent to give material more body, in material such as silk, if added
  warmth is not desired.</p>
  <p>The interlining is cut from the pattern of the lining. Each section of the
    lining is opened and placed on the interlining material and basted all around
    the edges before it is cut. The interlining will remain basted to the silk
    until the side seams are joined when all four thicknesses of material will
    be stitched into one seam and the seams pressed open.</p>
  <p class="clear">The<img src="images/05_interlining-b.jpg" alt="interlining of side front and sleeve" width="132" height="163" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /> interlining is cut much shorter than the lining, usually extending below
    the hips but not to the hem. The sleeves are only cut to the top of the cuff.
    The lower edge hangs loose from the side seams.</p>
  <p>The center back of the lining is cut wider than the coat and the interlining
    will also be cut wider, but the heavy material should not be folded into
    a dart. Split the center back of the interlining to below the shoulders and
    overlap the top to match the coat. The slash remains open for freedom through
    the back.</p>
  <p class="clear"><img src="images/05_interlining-c.jpg" alt="side seam of interlining" width="132" height="178" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />The front dart is treated in the same manner. The dart line is split and
    overlapped and is not folded in as it will be in the silk lining. Overlap
    and baste the interlining to the shoulder seam and then baste the silk.</p>
  <p>The front facing is stitched to the front edge of the lining only, the seam
    is pressed flat, over toward the lining, then the interlining is caught to
    this seam with loose stitches before the facing is joined to the coat. It
    is not seamed into the seam with the lining.</p>
<h3>    <b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><a name="relining" id="relining"></a></i></font></b>Hand Applied Linings</h3>
  <h4>    Relining coats </h4>
  <p>The lining that is applied by hand-sewing is made differently. This method
    is used by the tailor and is used when relining coats.</p>
  <h4>    The pattern </h4>
  <p>If a coat is to be relined, save the old lining, rip it apart and press
    flat for a pattern. It is difficult to secure a perfect pattern for the lining
    without the old pattern as a guide. The new lining should be cut exactly
    like the old lining without allowances. If the old lining fit the coat, it
    will make a perfect pattern for the new lining.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/05_cut-stitch.jpg" alt="side view of side seam with shoulder seam sewn" width="131" height="195" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Cut and stitch</h4>
  <p>Cut the lining and stitch it together on the side seams. The sleeve linings
    are made and set into the coat after the body is lined. The shoulder seam
    remains open until later. The side seams are also pressed open.</p>
  <p>If a bust form is available it will be convenient to use but it is not a
    necessity. If the form is used, place the coat on the form wrong side out,
    and set the lining onto the coat.</p>
  <p>The side seams of the lining can either be machine stitched, pressed open
    and attached to the side seams of the coat as previously described, or the
    front sections of the lining can each be basted to the back edge of the side
    seams and shoulder seams as the garment lies flat on the table, and the back
    section of the lining will then be basted over the front section, with the
    edges of the seams turned under, turning them at the center of the pressed
    open seam of the outer coat. The lining is then slip stitched down with the
    tailor's slip stitch. (See <a href="hsc-4.html#hems">lesson on hem</a>.)</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/05_facing-b.jpg" alt="basting board being used to help baste lining and facing into place" width="84" height="147" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Facing</h4>
  <p>Slide the long basting board or magazine into the front of the coat as it
    is folded to the center front. Bring the lining to the front and over the
    facing, turn under the edge of the lining and pin. Pin the full length of
    the facing edge before basting as this line must be perfectly arranged without
    drawing. The coat again is slightly stretched so that the lining will be
    looser than the coat.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/05_dart.jpg" alt="dart marked from shoulder of side front to breast point" width="90" height="182" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />The dart</h4>
  <p>Fold under the dart toward the front and baste the front edge of the lining
    to the shoulder seam of the coat,. These stitches will remain in the coat;
    make them on the back edge of the seam. Baste the dart shut. After it is
    pressed, the basting will be removed. The dart is not stitched shut, but
    is needed for looseness across the chest.</p>
  <p>The back of the lining, is then brought over the front at the shoulder seam,
    turning under all edges. It is now ready to apply by hand.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/05_sleeves-b.jpg" alt="sleeve with dart marked on seam, with gathered sleeve cap, and smoothly set into armhole" width="132" height="196" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Sleeves</h4>
  <p>The sleeves are now set into the armhole. The coat sleeve is first turned
    wrong side out and the lining wrong side out. Be sure to select the lining
    that belongs to the sleeve, do not reverse the linings. Slide them onto the
    arm as they bill be worn to be sure of the right lining.</p>
  <p>The side seams of the sleeves lining are then basted to the side seams of
    the coat with a tuck in the lining at the elbow to prevent any drawing on
    the outer sleeve. (See lined coats.) The seams are both pressed open and
    one side of the seam only is basted. Both the coat sleeve and the sleeve
    lining are wrong side out. (See previous method.)</p>
  <p>There are two methods of finishing the sleeve cap. The sleeve cap can be
    turned back and gathered with very small stitches, and finished over the
    armhole of the lining after it has been basted to the armhole of the coat;
    or preferably, baste the sleeve cap to the armhole with small stitches, basting
    to the outer edge of the pressed-open seam of the armhole as these stitches
    will remain. Sew close to the seam. Turn under the edge of the armhole lining,
    clipping it at the curve, and baste the armhole over the sleeve cap and stitch
    to place with the tailor's slip stitch.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/05_hand-sewing.jpg" alt="slip-stitching lining into coat" width="132" height="96" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Hand sewing</h4>
  <p>The lining is set into the coat with the tailor's slip stitch. This stitch
    differs from the regular slip stitch in the method of holding the material
    while working. (See slip stitched hem.)</p>
  <p>The edge of the lining is basted to the coat an eighth-inch from the edge.
    When the slip stitch is made, fold the lining back at this joining edge so
    that the wool faces the worker and the lining is back from the eye. Take
    a stitch into the wool and on the same stitch slide the needle into a fold
    of the lining. Draw out the thread and repeat the stitch, a small stitch
    in the under-seam and a slide stitch in the fold of the lining. This makes
    a stitch back from the edge of the fold and will make it in. visible when
    flat.</p>

<h3>    <b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="fur" id="fur"></a></font></b>FUR</h3>
<h4>  The pattern </h4>
<p>Fur is handled differently than cloth, both in cutting and sewing. A pattern
    of cloth must first be made to secure the exact pattern for the fur. All
    the alterations must be made on the cloth pattern. The fur is then matched
    and cut to fit the pattern.</p>
  <p>Fur collars are made with the fur running toward the center back or straight
    down. Wide shaped collars are made with the fur running down. Cuffs are made
    with the fur running from the front to the back on the top of the cuff. The
    upper part of the pelt is heavier than the under side, and this quality of
    the fur should be matched when joining.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/05_cutting.jpg" alt="using a razor blade to cut along pencil line on fur" width="132" height="118" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Cutting</h4>
  <p>It is necessary to cut fur in numerous pieces to match the quality and color.
    Determine the section to be cut out, make a pencil line for the cutting and
    cut from the pelt side, cutting with a razor blade, pinning the top edge
    of the pelt to the basting board and cutting downward as the pelt is held
    away from the board. This prevents cutting any of the long hair of the fur.</p>
<h4 class="clear">  <img src="images/05_joining.jpg" alt="hand-sewn seam along fur" width="96" height="157" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Joining</h4>
  <p>Fur machines are used for joining fur in manufacturing, but the home sewer
    does not have this convenience and must join it by hand. The pelt is laid
    with the furs together and the seam is overcast closely with firm thread,
    not heavy thread as it will cut the fur. Use short strands of thread in the
    needle as the work will progress more rapidly. If the fur has a thin pelt,
    use a fine needle so as not to split the pelt.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">Padding</h4>
  <p>Fur requires padding to give <img src="images/05_padding-b.jpg" alt="padding stitch" width="132" height="167" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />the <img src="images/05_padding.jpg" alt="padding stitch" width="75" height="174" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />desired effect of softness, hence it is
    necessary to pad the collars and cuffs and sometimes the whole coat. Cotton
    sheet wadding is used, it can be purchased at the lining counter of any department
    store. Two thicknesses makes a normal padding, four sheets makes a thick
    padding, the amount to use will depend upon the thickness desired; the thicker
    the padding, the thicker the fur appears.</p>
  <p>Fur cloth is handled the same as fur when making a collar and cuffs. The
    same padding and edge finish will be used to give it more body.</p>
  <p>The sheet wadding will be cut to fit the collar, patching the under pieces
    if so desired, as it will all be caught to the pelt. The outer sheet should
    not be pieced. Do not overlap the cotton. Catch the cotton to the pelt side
    of the fur with a staggered stitch, taking first a stitch on an upper line
    and then a stitch on a lower line, working from the right to the left. Make
    the stitches about two inches apart. Continue until all the cotton is held
    to the pelt.</p>
  <p>If the collar or cuffs are shaped with darts, these darts should be cut
    out of the wadding so as not to make it too thick. Catch the edges to the
    pelt.</p>
  <h4>    Edge finish </h4>
  <p>The edge of the fur must be faced back with half-inch cotton tape. Machine
    stitch or overcast the tape flat and as close as possible to the edge of
    the fur with the tape extending over the edge. The corners of the tape will
    be mitered when the corners are turned and will not be cut off.</p>
  <p>The cotton wadding should extend under the tape as it is turned back and
    caught to the wadding. The tape is not caught through to the pelt when finished.
    Fell the tape down, rolling the fur over the edge as it rests in place flat
    to the cotton.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/05_attached.jpg" alt="attaching lining to fur collar" width="132" height="111" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Attached collar</h4>
  <p>The lining is now ready to apply to the fur collar. The coat or the lining
    is applied to the collar rather than the collar being applied to the coat.</p>
  <p>Pin the lining of the collar to place, pin under the edges and baste to
    position. Sew from the lining side of the collar. Apply with a slip stitch.
    Slide the needle into a fold of the lining and catch to a few threads of
    the tape on the fur. Repeat until the lining is completely attached.</p>
  <p>The collar is sewed to the coat in the same manner. It should be sewed with
    heavy thread. Sew the neck of the coat to the collar, catching the tape edge
    of the fur. Tack securely. The fur side is held to the back and the coat
    to the front when sewing fur to the coat.</p>
  <h4>    Large collars </h4>
  <p>Large fur collars that are melon-shaped should have the lining caught up
    to the pelt of the fur on the underside to hold it in place so that the lining
    will not drop. The stitches are made as invisible as possible.</p>
  <p>Worn sections in fur coats can be replaced by purchasing pelts from the
    furrier to match. Cut out the worn spots and cut a pattern to fit; then cut
    a new section and sew in as directed.</p>
<h3 class="clear">    <b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="pockets" id="pockets"></a></font></b>POCKETS, CUFFS AND SHIELDS</h3>
  <h4>    <img src="images/05_practical.jpg" alt="pocket, and tailor tacked marking on garment where pocket (and buttonhole) will be placed" width="132" height="174" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Practical pocket</h4>
  <p>There are many kinds of pockets used in tailoring, but many of them are
    quite difficult to make and are usually used only by the tailor. Slot pockets
    are as easy to make as bound buttonholes and are made quite similarly. They
    give an additional touch of trimming to many tailored dresses and dressmaker
    coats, especially the tailored pocket with a welt.</p>
  <p>As all material works somewhat differently, it is advisable to make a sample
    pocket of the material of the garment before making the pocket. Carefully
    follow each step as given, and the pocket develops so perfectly that it will
    be a pleasure to make them.</p>
  <p>Each step of the pocket construction will be pressed; therefore, carefully
    follow the directions for each step of the pressing, as the iron saves much
    time and perfects the work quickly.</p>
  <p>Both sides of the garment should be marked for the pocket slot, marking
    with tailor's tacks. Do not depend upon measurements for placing pockets
    evenly.</p>
  <h4 class="clear"><img src="images/05_make-sample.jpg" alt="sample pocket" width="132" height="162" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Make a sample
    pocket</h4>
  <p>For example: Make a sample pocket four inches wide and the welt, or top
    of the pocket, will be three-quarters inch deep. The pocket material will
    be cut five inches wide and ten inches long. This should be cut on the lengthwise
    of the goods.</p>
  <p>Press the pocket material in half across the width, folding the wrong sides
    together for the crease. If there is a stripe or a cord in the material,
    be sure to press mark on the <strong>straight line</strong> of the cord or the stripe.</p>
  <p class="clear">Apply the <strong>right</strong>    side <img src="images/05_make-b.jpg" alt="pocket, folded and flat" width="132" height="143" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />of the pocket material to the basted line on the <strong>right</strong>    side of the garment, matching the crease to the line with the right sides
    of the material together. Slip stitch the crease to the basted line on the
    dress. If this line is not straight, the threads in the welt of the pocket
    will be crooked.</p>
  <p>Open the pocket piece and pin at the top and bottom. Half will now be above
    and half below the line. The basted line will be covered. Pin all four corners
    of the pocket material to place.</p>
  <p class="clear"><img src="images/05_make-c.jpg" alt="pocket welt being formed" width="132" height="108" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Turn the garment to the wrong side (or use sample material) and chalk mark
    the box opening or welt (as illustrated), making the basted line through
    the center. Mark a straight line at one-half inch above the basted line and
    also at one-quarter of an inch below the line. Mark off the ends so as to
    make a four-inch length on each line. Machine stitch around the lines, starting
    in the center of one long side; when the corners are reached lower the needle
    into the corner, lift the presser foot of the machine and turn, using the
    needle as a pivot.</p>
<p class="clear"><img src="images/05_make-d.jpg" alt="pocket being applied to garment" width="132" height="198" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Count the stitches across the end so that both ends will be made the same.
    Make each comer true; continue stitching down the second long side and overlap
    the stitches. The lines should be equally spaced.</p>
  <p>The center line will now be slashed, starting at the center and not at the
    end. Slash to within one-half inch of the end and then clip to the corners.
    Repeat the operation on the other end. This point will be used later to hold
    the pocket in place. Be sure not to clip the machine stitching. If this should
    occur, restitch on the same line.</p>
  <p>Turn to the wrong side, draw through the material and press out the opening
    into four true corners.</p>
  <p class="clear"><img src="images/05_make-e.jpg" alt="garment folded to show pocket applied on inside" width="132" height="163" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Lift the lower section and bring it up to fill the opening, press open the
    lower seam, then turn back and press flat. This will press the welt in place,
    filling the opening completely.</p>
  <p>This next step is important and is easily forgotten. Pin the lower edge
    of the welt to the pocket on the welt side of the seam; turn the garment
    with the pocket side down on the machine, fold back the front or dress side
    of the pocket and machine stitch across this lower seam to hold the welt
    to the pocket. The stitches are not visible on the right side.</p>
  <p>Place the pocket on the press board with the right side down and press the
    back of the pocket, folding down the upper section of the pocket material
    to press the pocket together.</p>
  <p class="clear"><img src="images/05_make-f.jpg" alt="still more steps in attaching pocket to garment" width="132" height="166" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />The ends of the pocket are now ready to be stitched. Place the pocket wrong
    side down on the machine; fold back the dress away from the points that were
    clipped at the ends. Start to stitch at the top of the point, stitching from
    the point side of the seam. Machine stitch over the point and continue down
    around the pocket to shape it and up to the other point and across it. Stitch
    on the first, machine stitching across the point. If the stitches are made
    too far back the pocket will bulge.</p>
  <p>This finishes the pocket. Trim off the shaped edge as desired. The edges
    can be overcast. With a little practice this pocket can be made complete
    in five minutes.</p>
  <p class="clear"><img src="images/05_make-g.jpg" alt="strips of pocket welt matching strips of garment" width="132" height="191" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />If the dress is trimmed in a contrasting material the welt can be made of
    this material by using two separate pieces on the back, each piece five inches
    long, using the upper section of the dress material and the lower section
    of the contrasting. The two pieces are placed along the basted line for the
    pocket. If there are stripes in the dress material this top section must
    match the stripes perfectly when placed on the basting, as this will be the
    joining seam of the pocket and garment. Make the pocket as directed. The
    trimming material will be at the bottom and will be brought up to fill the
    opening with its welt. The top section will be the back section of the pocket
    and should match the dress.</p>

  <p><img src="images/05_welt-a.jpg" alt="applying a separate welt" width="132" height="159" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />A separate pocket welt is made, turned and pressed before it is set into
    the slashed opening. This pocket is used on tailoring and is more difficult
    to make than the one just described. This pocket is also used on diagonal
    openings.</p>
  <p>The pocket is marked and the opening is slashed and clipped to the corners.
    A straight piece of tailor's canvas is basted to the back of the opening.
    Make the welt according to the pattern (see illustration). It is stayed with
    an extra piece of thin tailor's canvas inside. Clip the corners and turn,
    pressing flat, before basting to the opening. If it is flat stitched this
    should also be done before applying. Baste the welt to the slashed opening
    of the pocket together with the front of the pocket as cut from the pattern.</p>
  <p class="clear"><img src="images/05_welt-b.jpg" alt="separate welt being applied" width="132" height="170" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />On the matching side of the pocket, or upper edge, baste the lining side
    of the pocket with the edges meeting along the basted line for the pocket
    opening. Stitch down both sides and across the ends. Turn to the wrong side,
    pull out the welt and press. Hold the pocket in position with pins and then
    baste and stitch around the edges, stitching across the points if flat stitched,
    or slip stitch down. Machine stitch around the under side of the pocket.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    Curved pockets</h4>
  <p><img src="images/05_curved.jpg" alt="curved pocket marked on garment" width="112" height="123" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />A curved pocket can be made either like a bound buttonhole with a narrow
    binding or can be made with a shaped welt according to the rules for an applied
    welt. The former is easier to make. Mark the pocket according to the pattern,
    or when remodeling, mark a pocket with a saucer, beginning and ending the
    pocket on the straight thread of the material.</p>
  <p>As this line in the pocket will run on a bias line on the garment, it is
    advisable to baste a straight strip across the back of the pocket edge for
    a stay to keep the edge from stretching. Baste this cotton or linen strip
    across the back of the pocket edge, then baste the line through both the
    coat and the stay. The tailor's tacks will give the line of the pocket for
    the first placement.</p>
  <h4 class="clear"><img src="images/05_pocket-a.jpg" alt="curved pocket opening being basted to scrap fabric" width="132" height="165" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />The pocket</h4>
  <p>Select a lengthwise piece of the coat material that will be three times
    the length of the pocket and two inches wider, measuring on the straight
    thread of the material. Turn the coat to the right side and place the pocket
    section on the goods with the right side of the scrap to the <strong>right</strong> side of
    the coat and with the top of the scrap extending two inches above the top
    of the pocket mark. Keep the threads of material matching.</p>
  <p>Pin and baste to place and then turn to the wrong side and machine stitch
    the curve, keeping a quarter inch from the center line. Stitch across the
    ends even with the straight thread of the goods. The space between the stitched
    lines will be one-half inch, the bound edges one-fourth inch. Slash open
    the center line along the first basting, starting at the center of the pocket,
    and clip to within a half inch of the ends. Clip to each point. This point
    of goods will be used later. Pull the pocket material through the opening.
    Press back the corners. Be sure to press them into true points&#8212;much
    of the success of the pocket depends upon true corners.</p>
  <p class="clear"><img src="images/05_pocket-b.jpg" alt="basted edges of curved pocket" width="132" height="165" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Paste back the edges of the pocket and make a simulated binding, basting
    the edge an even width at one-quarter inch. One edge should fill only half
    the opening. As the curve is cut on the bias and the binding material was
    placed on the same thread as the garment, the binding will also be cut on
    the bias and can be rolled back to shape itself to the curve. This could
    not be done if the edge was cut on the straight. Baste the other side of
    the pocket, making true corners. Cross stitch the edges together and press
    flat.</p>
  <p>Before the lower section is brought to the top the binding on the lower
    edge must be machine stitched on the right side following the crease of the
    curve. If the seam is pressed open the stitching can be made in the crease
    of the seam. If the seam has not been pressed open, then stitch below the
    binding as close as possible to it.</p>
  <p class="clear"><img src="images/05_pocket-c.jpg" alt="stitching around pocket" width="105" height="143" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />After the lower edge is stitched, bring up the back of the pocket and baste
    to place covering the opening. Then machine stitch along the upper curve
    along the binding to match the lower curve, stitching through the back of
    the pocket. Turn to the wrong side and machine stitch all around the pocket,
    stitching across the points at the ends. Trim the edges as desired.</p>
  <p>Pockets can be bound with military braid the same as buttonholes are bound
    with commercial seam binding. (See rules for bias binding.) The use of military
    braid requires careful basting. It is advisable to make several sample pockets
    first.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">Patch pockets</h4>
  <p><img src="images/05_patch.jpg" alt="patch pocket, rightside out, with stitching along edges" width="105" height="109" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Patch pockets look easy to make, but they are only easy when they are made
    correctly. Otherwise many difficulties will be encountered. Patch pockets
    should be lined with the same silk as the coat lining. The pocket is stitched
    to the pocket lining, turned and pressed before it is applied.</p>
  <p>Cut the lining the same size as the pocket, or an inch shorter if the pocket
    material extends down into the lining. Trim off the edges of the lining a
    quarter inch, depending upon the weight of the goods. This will make the
    sides and end of the pocket smaller than the outer pocket so that the seam
    will roll under.</p>
  <p class="clear"><img src="images/05_patch-b.jpg" alt="patch pocket, rightside out, with stitching along edges" width="132" height="111" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />A pocket flap or a facing that is stitched flat to the right side must be
    made and finished complete before the lining is applied. Then pin the lining
    to place, stretching it to match the pocket. Work from the center of the
    lower edge of the pocket and pin and baste to place.</p>
  <p>Stitch the lining to the pocket, starting the stitches on one straight side
    and stitch around to within two inches of the beginning of the stitching
    on the side. Leave this space open for turning. Trim the seam quite close.</p>
  <p class="clear"><img src="images/05_patch-c.jpg" alt="patch pocket, rightside out, with stitching along edges" width="127" height="174" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Notch the edge of the seam for turning to remove all surplus material from
    the seam. Turn and baste at the edge and press flat. Slip stitch the open
    space closed. If the pocket is on a wool coat, press well with a wet cloth.
    The pocket should be perfect before it is stitched to the coat. Baste to
    the coat and flat stitch according to the pattern, usually back from the
    edge. Make double stitching at the ends.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">Pockets in coat
    linings</h4>
  <p><img src="images/05_pockets-linings.jpg" alt="pocket marked on inside of side front" width="82" height="178" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />A pocket should be placed in the lining of the coat when there is no pocket
    on the outer coat. The pocket is placed in the lining before the lining is
    finished to the coat. There are two types of pockets, the invisible pocket
    and the corded or shirred pocket.</p>
  <p>The invisible pocket is placed between the lining and coat; the under side
    of the right side of the coat lining, so that it can be reached with the
    left hand without opening the coat. If preferred, it can be placed on the
    left side of the coat where it can be reached only with the coat opened.
    It is placed at the hip line at the edge of the lining where the lining is
    joined to the coat facing.</p>
  <p class="clear">Cut two<img src="images/05_pockets-lining-c.jpg" alt="pocket applied" width="91" height="180" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /> pieces of coat lining <img src="images/05_pockets-lining-b.jpg" alt="pocket marked on inside of side front" width="105" height="177" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />eight inches long and five inches wide. Baste
    the stitch together. Stitch across the top down the long edge and curving
    around the short end of the pocket and then up three inches on the other
    side. This should leave five inches for the hand opening.</p>
  <p>The pocket is attached to the coat at the hand opening. Machine stitch to
    the edge on the wrong side of the lining; turn and press at the edge. If
    the lining is in the coat before the pocket is made, then the pocket seam
    can be cross stitched to the lining at the edge. The lining is attached to
    the coat up to the pocket and then the back edge of the pocket is attached
    to the coat under the lining.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/05_corded.jpg" alt="two styles of pockets with cording" width="132" height="157" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Corded pockets</h4>
  <p>A pocket is often corded and applied on the right side of the lining on
    evening coats. It is made of double silk, stitched around the pocket and
    turned at a small opening at the lower edge. Baste and press. Stitch two
    rows across the top one inch from the upper edge to make a space for a cord.
    Also attach across the lower edge. Clip open the double material on the wrong
    side and draw a small cable cord through the stitched opening. There should
    be two rows of stitching for each cord. Draw up the pocket to the desired
    size and stitch to the lining.</p>
<h3 class="clear">    <b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="cuffs" id="cuffs"></a></font></b>CUFFS AND SHIELDS</h3>
  <h4><img src="images/05_cuffs.jpg" alt="view of sleeve with seam sewn, and cuffs, interlining, and lining" width="132" height="171" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Cuffs</h4>
  <p>Cuffs should be cut a trifle larger than the width of the edge of the sleeve
    if the edges are to be joined or are to meet. This is not so important in
    silk as it is in heavy coats. The thickness of the coat sleeve will enlarge
    the size of the cuff at least a quarter inch. The coat sleeve is hemmed,
    not faced, and the cuff is made complete and then applied. This prevents
    a bulk of material at the wrist.</p>
  <p>Wide coat cuffs should be interlined with tailor's canvas or muslin. Narrow,
    tailored cuffs are also often interlined with bias-cut canvas used in mannish
    tailoring.</p>
  <p>It is most important to trim back the edges of the under facing of cuffs
    so that the edge will turn without bulging and the seams will not be visible
    from the right side. Trim back a quarter inch on both the top and the sides.
    This will make the cuff facing smaller than the outer cuff.</p>
  <p>Linings or facings of coat cuffs should be made of the lining of the coat
    rather than a double section of the material. The lower edge of the coating
    should be turned back over the trimmed inner reinforcement, pressed and the
    silk lining felled to it. Press perfectly before applying to the sleeve.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/05_applied-b.jpg" alt="cuff applied to sleeve" width="132" height="143" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Applied</h4>
  <p>Pin the cuff on the edge of the finished sleeve. Test to see that it fits
    perfectly. If the cuff has an opening at the back, this opening will be placed
    at the back of the sleeve and not at the seam. For a one-piece sleeve fold
    the sleeve with the seam in the center of the wrist. Place a pin at the back
    edge of the fold. This will be the point where the back of the cuff will
    rest.</p>
  <p>Tack the open cuff ends together on the wrong side, pin to the mark at the
    back of the sleeve, and slide the cuff down an eighth inch below the edge
    of the sleeve and pin all around the cuff. It will then be slip stitched
    to place.</p>
<h3 class="clear">    Shields</h3>
  <h4><img src="images/05_shields.jpg" alt="underarm shields" width="132" height="146" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Shields</h4>
  <p>Coats often have shields covered with the same silk as the lining.</p>
  <p>Purchase a good quality of shields. Rubberized cloth is advisable in preference
    to rubber. Cut the shield in two on the curve of the arm. Using this for
    a pattern, cut two sections of silk, making them one-half inch or more wider
    than the shield on the outer curve. The cut edge of the shield of the arm
    curve has no seam allowance.</p>
  <p>Hold the silk on top, basting the silk to the shield, matching the edges
    and easing in the silk on the bias parts. Start at the top with both the
    shield and silk matching, make a narrow seam. The silk will be puckered to
    the shield with the edges matching.</p>
  <p>Machine stitch this basted seam; remove the basting and turn. The silk will
    now roll over the edges of the shield and make a cloth edge for slip stitching
    to the coat lining. Do not press.</p>
  <p>Make the other side of the shield in the same manner and turn. Place the
    two finished sections with the silk sides together and machine stitch the
    shield back to its original joining at the under arm. There will be a raw
    edge of all four sections in one seam, the two parts of the shield and the
    two seams of the silk.</p>
  <p>Place the shield into the coat over the finished lining, sliding the shield
    to the front. Pin to place with several pins. Lift the shield at the edge
    with the lining toward you and the shield to the back so that lost the edge
    of the shield is visible. Then slip stitch the shield to place with the tailor's
    slip stitch, making the stitches invisible. Tack securely at the armhole.
    (See rules for tailor's slip stitched hem.)</p>
  <p>Turn the sleeve wrong side out, and apply the other side of the shield in
    the same manner.</p>
  <p>    Cross stitched The shield can then be cross stitched all around the edge
      <strong>after</strong> it is slip stitched. Use buttonhole twist for the cross stitching.
      The edge of the pocket can also be cross stitched. The yoke is likewise
cross stitched, as is the end of the dart.</p>

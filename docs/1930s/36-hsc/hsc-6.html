<h3>Materials</h3>
  <h4>      Be cautious
when cutting </h4>
  <p>It is necessary to be more cautious when cutting some materials than when
    cutting others, as the one way materials, plains and stripes, large floral
    patterns and napped materials develop complications different from plain
    material. The goods should be examined and the arrangement of the pattern
    fully understood for the type of material before the material is cut.</p>
  <h4>    When in doubt </h4>
  <p>When in doubt as to whether the material has an up and down, it is advisable
    to place all the sections of the pattern with the top of the pattern to the
    top of the goods. Many pattern layouts are arranged in this manner so that
    they will apply to one way material. It is advisable, however, to determine
    the correct placement of each piece before cutting even the first section.
    If a layout shows pieces reversed, it is intended only for use when cutting
    a fabric without a distinct up and down.</p>
  <h4>    Never
compromise </h4>
  <p>Never compromise on the lengthwise thread when cutting intricate materials.
    It is advisable to piece an inconspicuous corner rather than to cut one section
    upside down. More of this type of material is required than material on which
    the pattern can be reversed. This should be borne in mind when the good is
    purchased.</p>
  <h4>    Different
surface </h4>
  <p>All materials that have a different surface on the wrong and right side
    will be easily detected. If all the pattern is laid out right side up and
    all placed in one direction before the material is cut, it will be easier
    to avoid errors in cutting. Cutting this material one piece at a time often
    leads to tragic results. Place all the pattern on the goods before cutting
    and carefully check the number of pieces.</p>
  <h4>    Up and
down prints </h4>
  <p>Study figured prints to determine if the figures all run one way or if some
    of them are upside down. If all the designs are one way, then all the pattern
    must be placed one way on the goods. If some of the designs are upside down,
    then the pattern can usually be placed either way. Small designs are usually
    reversed and can be cut either way, but be cautious when cutting large floral
    patterns. These must also be placed correctly on the pattern. Large plaids
    also require caution. Nap materials will also have a decided up and down
    and must be cut with all sections placed with the top of the pattern to the
    top of the material.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <b><a name="diagonals" id="diagonals"></a></b>Diagonal
weaves</h4>
  <p>The diagonal weaves, such as serge materials,<img src="images/06_diagonal-a.jpg" alt="bodice front with diagonal pattern" width="127" height="137" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /> have a decided twill running
    diagonally across the material. There are many striped materials that are
    also printed with a diagonal stripe. If this stripe is not understood, some
    of the sections may be cut incorrectly, and if the material is turned to
    the wrong side, or it cut crosswise, the stripe will run in the opposite
    direction. The pattern, however, can be turned upside down and the diagonal
    will remain the same, but the pattern cannot be placed on the crosswise or
    on the wrong side unless the stripes are supposed to converge on a center
    line. It will then be necessary to change the thread of material for cutting.
    (See rules for stripes.)</p>
  <p class="clear">All diagonal <img src="images/06_diagonal-b.jpg" alt="different ways diagonal lines may line up along bias strips" width="132" height="106" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />weaves will run from the high left to the low right; from the
    left shoulder to the right hip. If undecided as to which is the correct line,
    hold the piece up to the body and follow this rule for the right side. The
    diagonal lines will follow this rule on all sections of the garment.</p>
  <p>When cutting bias strips for binding, be sure to make all the lines of the
    diagonal run in the same direction with the lines running short across the
    bias strip.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <b><a name="floral" id="floral"></a></b><img src="images/06_floral.jpg" alt="two dress fronts, one with three large flowers down center front, and one with offset flowers, two down left side of garment, three down right side" width="132" height="159" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Large floral
patterns</h4>
  <p>Large floral patterns should be cut with the pattern placed down the center
    front and back or else placed symmetrically on each side, measuring from
    the centers. The same is true of cutting large plaids; the center of a large
    block should be placed in the center of the section. Select the dominant
    figure and plan the pattern around it. Hold the goods up to the figure and
    determine the desired effect. A large figure should come below or at the
    sides of a neck line. The general effect of the placement of the figures
    determines much of the effect of the finished garment. This type of material
    requires more material for the matching, and it is advisable to purchase
    an additional quarter or half yard of material.</p>
  <h4>    <b><a name="stripes" id="stripes"></a></b>Stripes
and plaids </h4>
  <p>There are many lessons that should be understood before attempting to make
    a striped or plaid dress. Much of the beauty of the garment depends upon
    the perfect matching of converging lines of the stripes. The <a href="hsc-2.html#basting">lessons
    on right side basting</a> will be valuable for reference.</p>
  <p>Work out some of these problems before making the garment.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/06_plaid.jpg" alt="stripe patterns forming a plaid" width="98" height="127" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Study the plaid
    or striped
material</h4>
  <p>Many plaid materials have a decided up and down; two sides of the plaid
    will have heavier stripes than the other two sides. This uneven plaid must
    be cut with all the heavy stripes at the bottom of the pattern and all stripes
    must join on the seams. Materials with variegated stripes or the Roman striped
    material should match on the dominant stripes, as it will be impossible to
    match all stripes of the pattern.</p>
  <h4>    Select the
pattern </h4>
  <p>Select the pattern for a striped or plaid dress with the pattern illustrated
    in stripes if converging lines are desired. If a plaid pattern is selected
    it is advisable to pencil mark the lines of the stripes on the tissue pattern
    before cutting the garment. Only a few lines are necessary, sufficient to
    determine the correct line to use for cutting. The line of the stripe can
    be marked in preference to the lengthwise thread of material as is usually
    found. Also mark the lines on the illustration. If the pattern illustration
    gives a definite line for the stripes, and some of the lines are to be changed,
    it is advisable to pencil mark both the new lines on the pattern and also
    the lines on the illustration.</p>
  <h4>    Piecing stripes </h4>
  <p>It is often necessary to piece the corners of material that is cut on the
    bias. This is especially true of cutting converging lines in the seams of
    striped dresses. Stripes and plaid can easily be pieced if the rules for
    right side basting are followed. The piecing will then be inconspicuous.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/06_cutting.jpg" alt="bodice front pattern piece laid at an angle along stripes" width="132" height="144" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Cutting stripes
and plaids</h4>
  <p>When cutting stripes and plaids it is advisable to cut single sections rather
    than to cut double as is generally the rule. Plan the cutting carefully;
    then cut one side of the dress if the center has a seam. If the pattern is
    placed on the right side of the material when cutting the first section,
    turn the goods to the wrong side and place this same pattern with the goods
    pinned to it for the matching section, pinning it to the matching stripe
    on the wrong side of the goods. This will put the wrong sides of the goods
    together; they will match on the center seam if the pattern has been placed
    so as to match the stripes.</p>
  <h4>    Wasteful </h4>
  <p>Cutting stripes and plaids is often wasteful, as the pattern must be drawn
    down to match the lines of the plaids. If the plaids are widely spaced, it
    may be necessary to waste several inches of the material for a perfect match.
    It is also advisable to cut wide seams for stripes and plaids, as it is sometimes
    necessary to slide the seam over to match a stripe. It is therefore advisable
    to purchase extra one-quarter to one-half yard of material if wide stripes
    and large plaids are to be used.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/06_matching.jpg" alt="lines marked on skirt pattern to show where fabric stripes will be matched at seam line" width="128" height="184" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Matching
side seams</h4>
  <p>The side seams of stripes should also match. This makes the cutting even
    more difficult, but the perfect matching makes the garment attractive and
    is well worth the effort.</p>
  <p>Let us assume that the back of the skirt has been cut first. Do not remove
    the goods from the back pattern. Press over the seam of this back section
    at the sewing line and place the pattern on the matching section of the front
    of the skirt, placing it at the sewing line of the front pattern. Then pencil
    mark the same stripe on the front of the pattern marking the dominant stripe
    or some definite stripe for identification when cutting. Make at least two
    sets of pencil marks for the stripe line on the pattern and also mark the
    direction in which they will run.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/06_cut-front.jpg" alt="skirt fronts laid at right angles on striped fabric" width="132" height="157" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Cut the front</h4>
  <p>The front of the skirt will then be ready to place. Slide the pattern up
    or down on the goods so as to match the pencil mark to the correct stripes.
    Pin carefully, matching the pencil-marked stripes. The second stripe is as
    important as the first stripe; it will determine the slope of the material
    and pattern. Cut one section only; after the first one is cut match it to
    the back and cut the other side as directed for cutting the back.</p>
  <h4>    Joining seams </h4>
  <p>Stripes and plaids should be basted before stitching and checked to determine
    the correct matching of the stripes. This can best be accomplished with the
    right side basting rules or by pressing back one side of the seam and slip
    stitching the seam from the right side. All stripes should match perfectly.</p>
  <h4>    Sheer materials </h4>
  <p>Sheer materials are often difficult to handle. The stiff shears such as
    organdy weaves will retain their shape to a certain extent and will be easier
    to sew than the soft shears such as chiffons, georgetts and voils. It may
    even be necessary to first baste the goods to paper before stitching the
    seams. In this case a large table is necessary to be able to hold the material
    to its original shape for the pinning. The pattern should remain on the goods
    until it is pinned. If paper is not used it is advisable to place the pattern
    onto the basted seam to test it for perfect length before stitching. If this
    is not done the seam may be stretched out of shape when stitched, and the
    effect of the dress may be ruined. This is often the case when sewing bias
    edges. It may be necessary to machine stitch the raw edges of all bias edges
    before they are basted. This is often helpful when making drop shoulder yoke
    effects, stitching the edge to hold the shape. The original pattern can be
    stitched into the seam and then be torn away.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/06_sheers.jpg" alt="pins placed around edge of fabric to attached to stabilizing paper" width="132" height="144" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /><a name="sheers" id="sheers"></a>Sheers stretch</h4>
  <p>When cutting small sections of sheer material such as bias seam binding,
    it is advisable to pin the goods to a paper, straightening the material to
    its original thread before cutting. The lines of the newspaper can be followed
    to secure the straight thread of the goods. Sheer material stretches when
    cut and it is advisable to test the necessary width so as to allow for the
    stretching after it is cut. When cutting with paper, cut through both the
    paper and material.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/06_sheers-sag.jpg" alt="two skirt fronts, one showing stretching and sagging effect" width="129" height="155" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Sheers sag</h4>
  <p>Allow ample fullness at the lower edge of the skirt when cutting from sheer
    material, as the bias of sheer material sags greatly. This sagging will reduce
    the fullness of the skirt. A skirt pattern that is only slightly circular
    on heavy material may be perfectly plain and straight if cut from sheer material
    and may not look like the pattern picture. If a circular skirt is to be full
    and is to be cut from sheer material, measure the lower edge of the skirt
    and if it is not amply wide, increase the fullness at the lower edge by splicing
    and spreading the pattern. Spread the pattern on the bias section only. It
    is advisable to ask the pattern saleswoman if the pattern is designed for
    sheer material--or ask the width of the hem of the skirt.</p>
  <h4>    Basting </h4>
  <p>All sheer material should be basted flat on the table; never in the hands
    if the seams are long. Place the more bias section on top. Straighten each
    edge to its original shape and pin to place, then baste flat.</p>
  <p>All short seams should be pinned together as they lie flat, matching the
    ends of the seams first and then pinning in the centers. Be sure to match
    all notches when basting with shears, as the bias edges will soon lose their
    shape.</p>
  <h4>    Stitch with
paper </h4>
  <p>It is sometimes difficult to machine stitch sheer materials, as the seam
    will pucker. Baste a strip of tissue paper along the seam and as the machine
    stitches over the paper it will separate and can easily be removed.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/06_neck-lines.jpg" alt="machine-stitched neckline with shoulder seams joined" width="132" height="101" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Neck lines
of sheers</h4>
  <p>Neck lines and curves of sheer fabrics should be machine stitched around
    the raw edge before the finish is applied or the matching seam joined. Hold
    the material straight on the straight thread of the goods when stitching.
    (See machine stitching.) Test to determine if it lies flat after it is stitched.
    Slide the basting board into the neck. A magazine can be used if the basting
    board is not at hand.</p>
  <h4>    Sheer hems </h4>
  <p>Hems on sheer material are made narrow. They can be picoted (cutting away
    half of the hemstitching) or the hem can be rolled by hand.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/06_narrow-hems.jpg" alt="narrow hems" width="132" height="156" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Narrow hems
on sheers</h4>
  <p>Stitch the hem as close to the edge as possible. Do not turn under the edge.
    Trim off any frayed threads, roll under the edge and slip stitch the hem,
    trimming off a few inches ahead of the hand sewing. Trim to an eighth-inch
    from the machine stitches. If the edge is trimmed closer and rolled smaller
    it will be possible to make a very small hem. Catch the end of the hem to
    the basting board with a pin and then make a tension on the hem as it is
    rolled. Push under the edge with the point of the needle and the hem can
    be made as narrow as desired.</p>
  <h4>    Inside finish
of sheers </h4>
  <p>Good dressmakers finish the seams of shears, for the garment will be transparent.
    All seams can either be hemstitched and trimmed on the outer edge of the
    hemstitching or one edge can be turned over the other edge and slip-stitched
    to place or can be hemstitched for a finish. French seams may be used by
    the expert seamstress.</p>
  <h4>    <b><a name="nap" id="nap"></a></b>Nap and pile </h4>
  <p>Materials such as velvets and broadcloths have a rough surface of threads.
    The threads are either long and pressed flat which makes a pile fabric as
    in broadcloth, or the threads are shorter as in velvet, making a nap fabric.
    They may be very short as in velour and have no distinct up or down.</p>
  <h4>    Pile fabrics </h4>
  <p>The difference between nap and pile can easily be detected as the hand is
    rubbed back and forth over the surface of the material. Pile fabrics roughen
    easily. The surface also becomes darker when roughened as does the surface
    of an Axminster rug when brushed against the pile. Camel's hair coating also
    has a decided pile to the fabric and should all be cut with the pile running
    <strong>down</strong> on the material.</p>
  <h4>    Nap fabrics </h4>
  <p>Napped materials have a shorter thread, which makes it more difficult to
    determine the correct way for cutting; the nap must run <strong>up</strong>. It requires experience
    to easily detect the feeling of napped material as the hand is rubbed over
    the goods. The difference can also be seen if the material is draped over
    a chair, using both ends of the material for the draping. One end will appear
    much darker than the other end, it is the darker material that is draped
    correctly. All velvet weaves should deepen the sheen of the fabric. The reverse
    material can be used as a contrasting trimming but the garment should be
    cut with the darker sheen. <strong>Cut all napped material with the nap running up.</strong></p>
  <h4>    Velveteen </h4>
  <p>Velveteen has a nap that should run up. It is clipped so close that it is
    difficult to detect the correct way for cutting by feeling with the hands.
    Drape material to determine the darker sheen which will be the correct way
    for cutting.</p>
  <h4>    Velour weaves </h4>
  <p>Velour weaves have a rough surface but there is no sheen to the material
    and can therefore be cut either way. A safe rule to follow, however, is to
    cut all napped material with the nap running <strong>up</strong>.</p>
  <h4>    Tailor's variation </h4>
  <p>The tailor often cuts plain napped material on the crosswise thread of the
    goods for economy in cutting. As coating is 54 inches wide this is possible
    if the material is thoroughly understood. The width of the goods can thus
    be used for the length; the sheen is not apparent and the pattern can be
    placed to better advantage. The tailor often uses insets of the reverse material
    on widely spaced seams. This can be tested on scraps to determine the effect
    desired.</p>
  <h4>    <b><a name="satins" id="satins"></a></b>Satin </h4>
  <p>Satin material should be well-tailored. Satin cannot be ripped and altered
    as easily as other materials and should therefore not be attempted by the
    amateur. Marks of stitching and pressing are often difficult to remove.</p>
  <p>While satin does not have a nap or pile, it does change in the sheen on
    the crosswise thread and can be self trimmed beautifully. Drape the goods
    over a chair both lengthwise and crosswise and detect the darker and lighter
    shades of the goods. The lighter shade will be on the crosswise of the material.
    The garment is always cut on the lengthwise but can be trimmed on the crosswise.
    Mark any yoke or trimming sections that are to be changed when cutting. Draw
    new &quot;lengthwise thread of material&quot; on the pattern section that
    will be changed.</p>
  <h4>    Velvets </h4>
  <p>Velvet is cut, basted, marked and pressed differently from all other materials.
    The amateur should not attempt to make a velvet garment without first understanding
    the material. Upon the correct handling of velvet depends the success or
    failure of the garment. If handling velvet is a new experience in sewing
    it is advisable to make a few samples of the various problems before the
    garment is made.</p>
  <h4>    Up and down </h4>
  <p>There is a decided up and down to the velvet. It is cut with the nap running
    <strong>up</strong> which makes the garment darker in sheen. Definitely determine the top
    of the material and place all sections of the pattern with the top of the
    pattern to the top of the velvet.</p>
  <h4>    The pattern </h4>
  <p>The pattern should be pinned to the wrong side of velvet when cutting. This
    will reverse all printed patterns as they are printed right side out. All
    marks should be made on the lining of the velvet which will necessitate cutting
    from the wrong side. As velvet does not fold to a keen edge, a center mark
    should be made with chalk before the material is folded, if directions are
    given to cut double. Single cutting is advisable. Chalk-mark the sewing lines,
    tailor-tack all darts, tucks and folds. There should be no pressed pleats
    in velvet as the pleat will flatten the material when pressed.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/06_pins.jpg" alt="pins placed at a slant along seam line" width="132" height="138" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Pins</h4>
  <p>Pin all velvet seams with many pins. When the seams are pinned together
    place all pins slanting to the sewing line, placing the point of the pin
    on the line. This slanting pin will assist in preventing the material from
    sliding. Pin all sections together with the material flat on the table. Match
    the sewing lines carefully. The full length of the seam should be pinned
    before it is basted. Match both ends of the seam and pin closely as the material
    will slip when basting.</p>
  <h4>    Dressmaker's
basting </h4>
  <p>Baste velvet with close dressmaker's bastings. The seams of velvet will
    slide when machine-stitched; time may be saved if the whole dress is sewed
    by hand with buttonhole twist or heavy sewing thread. The sewing should be
    back stitched every few inches to hold firmly in place. If the machine is
    used, it is advisable to loosen the tension.</p>
  <h4>    Finishes of velvet </h4>
  <p>All finished bindings, facings and hems of velvets are made by hand. All
    finished edges are not turned under in velvet but are cross-stitched down
    or finished with ribbon seam-binding. Narrow seams, such as seams under a
    facing or binding, are pressed open with the fingernail and are not steamed.
    A velvet facing is sometimes held back with an invisible running stitch to
    hold it flat. (See &quot;waist finish.&quot;)</p>
  <h4>    Pressing </h4>
  <p>Velvet is not pressed flat, it must be steamed or pressed with the thumb
    nail or on a needle board. (See rules for pressing.)</p>

  <h3>    <b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="trimmings" id="trimmings"></a></font></b>TRIMMING SUGGESTIONS</h3>
  <p>Trimming suggestions are given with patterns but it is not always possible
    to use a pattern. A clever touch of trimming on a remodeled dress gives the
    touch of interest that is so desired and often eliminates the possibility
    of a &quot;home made&quot; look.</p>
  <h4>    Contrasting
materials </h4>
  <p>Contrasting material of plain color is often used in various ways as a trimming,
    possibly matched with buttons and a belt buckle. It may be worked into the
    dress in collars and cuffs, with scarfs or bows, a yoke and sleeve portion,
    or possibly the whole sleeve is made of contrasting material. Insets and
    godets, pleated sections and ruffles, or possibly the whole upper portion
    of the waist.</p>
  <p>The trimming material may be of the same quality as the material of the
    dress or of lace. It is advisable to purchase the trimming when the material
    is purchased as most stores stock contrasting colors for their fabrics. The
    color contrast varies with the seasons. If a garment is to be remodeled,
    it is advisable to match the material and the trimming. Sales people will
    offer excellent advice if it is requested.</p>
  <h4>    Twin fabrics </h4>
  <p>Twin fabrics make an excellent trimming. Printed fabrics such as polka-dots
    are made in twin materials, one has the dark background with the light dots
    and the other HAD the light background with the dark dots. The dark background
    material is usually made into the dress, and is trimmed with the other material,
    using the latter for collar, cuffs and revers, belts and ties.</p>
  <p>Net material can be used effectively for yokes and sleeves. It can be trimmed
    with folds of the dress material stitched in uniform width across the net
    or can follow in equal widths around the neck line of the yoke.</p>
  <h4>    Matching figures </h4>
  <p>If the material is figured, the trimming material should match the one of
    the colors of the figures; the color most becoming to the wearer should be
    selected. If the color is bright, a small portion is usually all that is
    necessary to use. Too much color may ruin the effect of the garment. Do not
    overtrim the dress.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/06_bright.jpg" alt="colored seam binding and tape applied as an accent" width="132" height="155" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Bright colors</h4>
  <p>A touch of bright color can be added in various shapes and sizes of buttons.
    Colored seam binding can be used in various ways, such as stitched tape for
    lacing through bound buttonholes. and colored edge on neck lines and sleeves.
    Tape can be faggoted together to make fancy shaped collars and cuffs, cutting
    a heavy paper pattern and basting the tape to the paper in rows. Tape can
    be stitched in lattice effect in sleeves or yokes to form a trimming.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/06_hand.jpg" alt="hand fagotting as a feather stitch, or straight across" width="132" height="188" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Hand faggotting</h4>
  <p>Narrow braids are usually faggotted with hand work. The braid is basted
    to the pattern, leaving a quarter-inch space between the rows. Use embroidery
    thread or knitting silk or heavy buttonhole twist, depending upon the effect
    desired. The stitch can be made as a feather stitch, working from left to
    right, making it cross in the center, or can be made straight across the
    opening, catching the thread to the opposite side and winding the head of
    the needle around the thread back to the beginning of the stitch.</p>
  <h4>    Faggoted yokes </h4>
  <p>Small figured material can be trimmed with a plain colored faggoting either
    of faggoted braid or made by hand with the same stitch as just described.
    This makes a most effective trimming as the outline of the cut of the dress
    is outlined with the openwork of the faggoting.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/06_braid.jpg" alt="faggoting braid applied to collar yoke" width="132" height="162" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Braid applied</h4>
  <p>Faggoting braid can be purchased by the yard at a reasonable price. The
    edge of the seam is basted to paper and the faggoting is basted under the
    edge of the material as it is folded back. Be sure to fold back more than
    the regular seam allowance or the garment will be too large. The center of
    the braid will be the center of the seam. The full seam allowance can usually
    be cut off before the braid is set in. After the braid is basted to the seam
    it is flat-stitched to place from the right side.</p>
  <h4>    Buttons </h4>
  <p>Buttons make an attractive trimming for many dresses. If the dress is light
    the buttons can be darker or if the dress is figured the buttons can be selected
    to match one of the colors. Large buttons and small buttons, oval ones and
    round, bar shaped and square, made of metal or glass, of bone or wood, carved
    and filigree, buttons covered with the matching material, either made by
    machine or covered by hand--there will surely be a button to suit the purpose.
    Buckles are often made to match the buttons and can also be covered with
    cloth. (See <a href="hsc-3.html#buttons">lesson on buttons</a>.)</p>
  <h4>    Bound
buttonholes </h4>
  <p>Bound buttonholes make a smart trimming for many tailored types of dresses.
    They are bound with material either like the dress or of a contrast. Usually
    the button furnishes the contrast and the buttonhole is bound with the same
    material as the dress. When one buttonhole is used, as a slot opening through
    which a tie or scarf is drawn, it is often bound with a contrasting material.
    A row of bound buttonholes furnishes a smart trimming for many tailored dresses.
    (See <a href="hsc-3.html#bound">lesson on bound buttonholes</a>.)</p>
  <h4>Ties</h4>
  <p>Ties also make a clever trimming when cleverly placed and are made correctly.
    Ties can be stitched into the shoulder seam and knotted at the side, front,
    or the back. Ties can be looped into a flat ascot tie at the throat or can
    be slipped through loops that have been stitched into the neck line or cut
    into the neck line of the dress.</p>
  <p class="clear">Two buttonholes can be placed close<img src="images/06_ties-b.jpg" alt="different ways ties can be used at neckline and waist" width="132" height="157" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /> together<img src="images/06_ties-a.jpg" alt="decorative collar scarft tied at front, and loops used to hold it in place" width="132" height="111" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /> and can be used for an excuse
    to hold a bow tie, or a tie can be caught to the neck line and drawn through
    these buttonholes. Ties can be made of two different colors or two shades
    of the same color. They can be seamed at the center back, brought to the
    front and made into a tie of two shades.</p>
  <p>Ties can be caught at the neck line with metal clips or can be run through
    slides which will also ornament the dress. Ties can be made as cords and
    laced through buttonhole slots or metal eyelets that can be punched by the
    button maker. Cords can be made from braided loops and either tied or used
    as a necklace.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/06_cutting-b.jpg" alt="layout on fabric of cutting ties on a bias or along lengthwise edge of goods" width="132" height="177" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Cutting ties</h4>
  <p>Ties should be cut correctly or they will not hang gracefully. Material
    for the ties should be cut on the lengthwise of the goods or on the bias;
    never cut a tie on the crosswise thread. Ties can also be cut on a true bias
    if they are wide but they will reduce in width as they are stretched in the
    tying. A tie that is to be washed should be cut on the lengthwise rather
    than on the bias, especially if it is made double. A double bias tie will
    not press perfectly after it is washed.</p>
  <p>Cut ties with ample fullness if they are to fall softly; thin, narrow ties
    are not effective. They should also be of ample length; the sheerer the material
    the wider the tie should be cut. When ties are cut double they are made rather
    narrow and are either looped or tied in a flat bow.</p>
  <h3>    Make a sample </h3>
  <p>It is sometimes advisable to make a sample tie of similar material to secure
    the desired effect before cutting the goods. It will then be possible to
    secure the correct length and width; an inch extra on the width makes a difference
    and a tie too short might ruin the dress.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/06_layout.jpg" alt="where to place seam if piecing together tie" width="64" height="195" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />The layout</h4>
  <p>Plan the layout of the tie when cutting the dress. There is usually ample
    material for a tie if the correct length is planned when cutting the dress.
    Long ties cut on the bias may be pieced in the knot or at the back, but the
    piecing must be made along the lengthwise thread of the material. This will
    be on the selvage of the goods. Never piece a tie across the bias of the
    tie. Press the seam open and flat. French seam if the tie is of one thickness.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    Finish of ties</h4>
  <p><img src="images/06_finish.jpg" alt="ways to finish the edges of ties" width="132" height="181" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Ties can be finished on the edge with a piquot made by splitting hemstitching.
    They may also be hemmed by hand or with the narrow machine hemmer. Bias ties
    should have the, raw edge stitched on the machine to hold it firm for the
    turning. A smaller and neater hem can be rolled if the edge is stitched.
    Do not turn under the edge, but stitch it an eight-inch from the cut edge.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    Scarfs</h4>
  <p><img src="images/06_scarfs.jpg" alt="triangle scarf as decorative neck treatment" width="100" height="91" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Triangular sections of material similar to half of a diagonally folded handkerchief,
    can be used as a scarf, tied either at the back or the front. Two sections
    can be tied together at the back of the neck and overlapped into a vest effect.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    Tying a bow</h4>
  <p><img src="images/06_tying.jpg" alt="best method to tie decorative bow" width="132" height="174" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />There is a trick to tying a bow perfectly. The knot overlaps one section
    only and should not be twisted. The two loops should be at the top of the
    bow and the two ends at the bottom with the cross loop straight down from
    the bow between the two loops.</p>
  <p>Overlap the two ends, bringing one end up to the top; this end will be used
    for the cross loop. Draw the two ends as close as they will be drawn in the
    tie, drawing the two ends at right angles to the circle, one end straight
    up and the other straight down. Make the first loop with the lower end, bring
    the upper end down over the loop and push it through the tie to form the
    second loop, draw up to position. The top section makes the overlap. Practice
    tying a bow around a vase or some small object; it may require some practice
    to understand how it should be done. A man's bow tie is tied in the same
    manner. Practice tying friend husband's tie.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/06_tailored.jpg" alt="how to construct a tailored bow" width="123" height="198" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Tailored bow</h4>
  <p>A tailored bow is often used as a flat trimming; it is cut in sections and
    sewed to position with formal folds at each end. Velvet ribbon or double
    silk sections make excellent tailored bows. They require no lining, lie flat
    and are very effective, at the side of the neck line or in the center front.
    Bias strips can be made double with the seam down the center on the under
    side of the fold. The edges will not be pressed but will remain soft. Heavy
    material such as crepe and velvet make excellent tailored bows.</p>
  <p>Cut the strips on the true bias of the material or a lengthwise, cutting
    the strips twice as wide and twice as long as the single loop. Two loops
    are used on each side.</p>
  <p>The cross section will be half as long as the loops. Stitch each section
    together and turn. Do not press the seam open nor press the edges. Fold the
    seam down the center of the loop. Overlap the end with a fold or pleat in
    the center and pin to place. Do the same with the other end of the loop.
    Tack the two ends with the folds with the needle and thread. Make the other
    loop in the same manner. One continuous piece can be used if so desired.
    Repeat the same operation for the second two loops. The under loops can be
    a trifle longer than the loops on top if so desired. Fold in the edge of
    the cross tab, sew to back of the loop, bring over and cover the front and
    finish at the back. The bow is sewed together and not tied.</p>
  <h4>    Pleating </h4>
  <p>Pleating is effectively used for trimming. It is often made on a matching
    or contrasting material. The pleating can be made very narrow and used as
    an edge trimming on revers, collars, cuffs and various portions of the dress.
    Narrow pleating is steam pleated by machine; it should be hemstitched for
    an edge finish before it is pleated. (See <a href="hsc-4.html#pleats">lesson
    on pleats</a>.) Narrow pleating
    may be shirred across the top in several rows.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/06_sunburst.jpg" alt="square with crosswise folds, folded so it can be cut into a circle" width="112" height="187" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Sunburst pleats</h4>
  <p>Sunburst or fan pleats can be made at home and are very attractive. They
    can be used as insets on skirts, in sleeves or on revers.</p>
  <p>Make a paper pattern of the pleats or a sample. Fold square of paper so
    as to cut a circle. Split the circle through the center, making but half
    a circle. The circle should be folded in many sections. Unfold the paper
    and fold it up as a fan, reversing the creases that are folded the wrong
    way.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    The material</h4>
  <p><img src="images/06_material.jpg" alt="fabric pleated into sunburst pleats" width="127" height="118" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />The pleated section of the material will be cut and folded in the same manner.
    The hem must be made before pleating. Allow for the seams at the sides. Fold
    up the goods and baste the outer edge of each pleat. The under edge will
    be automatically pressed to place when the pleats are pressed. Reverse all
    pleats necessary to make the fan. After they are all basted, fold all the
    edges even and over-cast together for a final pressing. Press with moisture
    so they will be steamed to position. Remove the bastings and the perfect
    fan pleat is ready to set into the garment.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">Godets</h4>
  <p>A godet is a segment <img src="images/06_godets-b.jpg" alt="use of godets in peplum, collar ruff, and sleeve trimming" width="132" height="168" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />of a<img src="images/06_godets.jpg" alt="decorative godet in skirt, and pattern piece before it is attached to skirt" width="131" height="187" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /> circle used as an inset in the garment, usually
    in the skirt. It is shaped like a &quot;piece of pie.&quot; The lengthwise
    thread of the material is usually placed down the center of the godet with
    the sides on the bias. This will give an additional fullness to a narrow
    skirt, setting the godet into a slash on both sides, or it can be used to
    give added fullness on a sleeve or revere collar effect.</p>
  <p>Long sections of material can be utilized by joining them with godets. This
    will make long circular sections that can be used for skirt tiers, or can
    be used to give additional length to a skirt. It can also be used to make
    long flared revers for the surplus neck opening or for sleeve trimmings.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">Jabots</h4>
  <p>Scraps <img src="images/06_jabots-b.jpg" alt="triangular piece draped into jabot" width="113" height="165" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />of material <img src="images/06_jabots-a.jpg" alt="shirred and gathered jabots" width="132" height="137" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />can be used as jabots, shirred at the side, corded in
    several rows or caught to the garment on the center with a metal clip. The
    jabot will be the dress trimming. It can be made of lace, or scraps of lace
    stitched together, a bit of embroidery material with a piquoted edge or a
    fancy colored handkerchief gathered through the center either straight or
  on the bias.</p>
  <p>Jabots can be made in various shapes and sizes. They are used as a trimming
    in the front of the dress at the neck. They are usually made of soft materials--often
    of lace. They should be quite full so as to fall in graceful folds. A circle
    can be split to the center, finished on the cut edge, gathered across the
    center and caught through the center with a long clip, the points held up
    on the dress and a butterfly is made. A circular lace piece makes an excellent
    jabot of this type.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    Collars&#8212;cuffs</h4>
  <p><img src="images/06_collars.jpg" alt="ruffled collars and cuffs" width="132" height="128" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Vests, cuffs, collars and revers can be made with varied fullness as a trimming.
    They may be tucked from the seam for a few inches, ending in a ruffle, making
    the tuck on either the right or the wrong side of the goods. Several rows
    of shirring can be used in the same manner or the shirring can be corded.
    A space can be shirred and an inch left plain within another row of shirring
    before the material remains free in a frill.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    Darts</h4>
  <p><img src="images/06_darts.jpg" alt="darts used to add fullness " width="127" height="147" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Darts can be made in collars and cuffs to add fullness. They can be made
    on either the right or the wrong side. Use a straight piece of goods. The
    point of the dart is at the joining seam of the collar or cuff and it will
    be stitched only a portion of the depth of the collar with the end puffing
    out into fullness. This dart can be set into a plain collar or cuff pattern,
    splitting the pattern and spreading it twice the width of the dart, about
    one inch for each dart.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    Shirring</h4>
  <p><img src="images/06_shirring.jpg" alt="parallel gathering stitches along edge of fabric form basis for shirring" width="92" height="187" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Shirring makes an effective trimming. It is used in many parts of the garment.
    A straight-across wide strip of material can be shirred for a collar or cuff,
    material can be shirred for the top of a sleeve and the plain sleeve pattern
    used after the shirting is made.</p>
  <p>To make shirring by machine, loosen the top tension, stitch several straight
    flat rows of stitching with the material right side up on the machine as
    it is the lower thread that will be drawn up. Keep the thread from tangling
    on the under side.</p>
  <p>After all the rows are stitched, turn to wrong side, and tie the threads
    on one end, testing each thread to see that it is knotted. Pull out the under
    thread of all the rows, even them up and wrap them <strong>all</strong> around the finger
    and gradually push up the gathers to the desired fullness. Drawing them all
    up at once diminishes the strain on any one thread and prevents them from
    breaking and also makes an even fluting of the gathers.</p>
  <h4>    Machine fluting
and pleating </h4>
  <p>Use the gatherer of the sewing machine for making wider fluting and small
    pleating. Loosen the top tension as this thread will be removed later. Make
    two or more rows of gathering the desired fullness. For pleating, make the
    rows one-half inch apart. Press flat, remove all the stitching but the first
    row and the material is pleated. Leave two or more rows in and it will be
    fluted between the rows.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/06_corded.jpg" alt="shirring formed through use of cording" width="132" height="143" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Corded shirring</h4>
  <p>Corded shirting is effective especially on velvets and collars. Various
    effects can be secured with cording. Make several rows of tucks on the right
    side of the material. They should be made by hand on velvet. The tuck must
    be sufficiently wide to take a cable cord at least one-eighth inch thick.
    Mark the rows so that they will be evenly spaced. The cable cord can be purchased
    at a notion counter. Wrap the end of the cord with thread and sew this end
    to a bodkin and draw the bodkin through the tuck, making it longer than the
    desired length of the finished portion. Cut off the cord and draw through
    the other cord sections. After all the cords are drawn through the tucks,
    draw them all up to the pattern shape. They should all be shaped simultaneously
    so as to pull the shirring crosswise.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/06_puffed.jpg" alt="fabric is gathered along corded shirring to form puffs" width="132" height="147" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Puffed shirring</h4>
  <p>Shirring can be puffed for velvet coat collars or for pillows and various
    trimmings.</p>
  <p>Draw up the cords as previously explained in corded shirring, then baste
    the outer edge of the shirring to a cloth pattern of the collar. Place a
    small roll of cotton sheet wadding under the puff and sew the second row
    of cord to place holding up the puff. Continue to the full size of the collar.</p>
  <h4>    Lace trimmings </h4>
  <p>Shaped yoke effects can be purchased to be used as insets on dresses, the
    outer edge is stitched to the garment and the material is trimmed away underneath.
    Many smart lace effects are offered for lingerie, shaped sections of lace
    can also be purchased for inset trimmings.</p>
  <h4>    Narrow lace </h4>
  <p>Narrow lace may be used for many purposes. There is a heavy thread that
    runs through the top edge that can be drawn up as a gathering thread. The
    lace is then either stitched on for the right side with the lace on the wrong
    side or felled on by hand.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">Scallops</h4>
  <p>Scallops make an excellent trimming on the edges of revers, collars, cuffs,
    and often on hems. The facing is made like the outer section, cutting it
    on the same thread of the materials.</p>
  <p>Cut a paper pattern of the collar or hem. <img src="images/06_scollops.jpg" alt="scalloped edging, applied to lapels" width="132" height="157" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Fold the edge into an evenly spaced
    division of the length, judging the size of the scallop desired. Select a
    dish or small object a trifle larger than the space, as the scallops do not
    run to a sharp point at the joining. Mark the scallop on the folded paper
    and cut it out. The edge will then be marked for the full length of the material.
    Pin the paper to the goods and pencil mark around the edge of the scallops.
    The corners should be a semi-circular. The points at the joining can be marked
    off with a pencil mark, reducing their depth. (See illustration.)</p>
  <p class="clear">Baste <img src="images/06_scollops-b.jpg" alt="scallops with facings, machine stitched at edges" width="115" height="177" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />the facing to the collar. Machine-stitch the shaped scallops to the
    facing, using the machine needle as a pivot when the point is reached. (See
    <a href="hsc-1.html#practice">lesson on machine stitching</a>.) Trim the seam very close, clip the point and
    turn, baste the edges closely, and press.</p>
  <p>Battlement trimming is made in squares instead of scallops and also makes
    a trimming edge for plain collars. Even up the space as for scallops. Mark
    off the squares, making the lines evenly spaced. Stitch to the shaped facing
    in perfect points, trim the seams, clip the corners, turn and press.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    Flares</h4>
  <p><img src="images/06_flares.jpg" alt="forming flares from square with slashed opening" width="132" height="184" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Flared collars, cuffs, reveres or skirt tiers can be added to the dress
    by cutting squares of material, folding double into a smaller square, slashing
    open one side, cutting a small circle from the point, one-quarter of the
    length to be covered with the flare. Open the piece and there will appear
    a rippled flare with four points. The corners can be cut off to form a circle.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    Appliquet</h4>
  <p><img src="images/06_appliquet.jpg" alt="circles being basted and appliqueted into position" width="132" height="150" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Appliquet makes an effective trimming on children's cloth aprons, pillows
    and many novelties. These appliquets can be traced from animal pictures or
    can be made of overlapped circles. The appliquet is cut from bright colored
    materials. The raw edge is usually sewed to the garment with small stitches
    and then is blanket stitched around the edge with embroidery floss.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    Tube trimming</h4>
  <p><img src="images/06_tube-trimming.jpg" alt="corded tubes used to make decorative shapes" width="115" height="149" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Corded tubes, made like tailored loops, of the material or of a contrasting
    color, makes an effective trimming for ties, braided belts, a necklace caught
    in the back with a clasp or frog, or lapped in the front with a tassel. Smaller
    strands can be looped and grouped together to form a shoulder or neck cluster
    for an ornament. The material is made as directed for making loops on the
    <a href="hsc-3.html#tailored">lesson on &quot;tailored loops.&quot;</a></p>
  <h4>    Stitching </h4>
  <p>Flat stitching often gives the trimming for tailored dresses. (See rules
    for flat stitching.) Collars, cuffs and belts are often filled completely
    with rows of stitching. (See <a href="hsc-4.html#belts">lesson on belts</a>.) The part to be stitched must
    be made of even width and must be stitched with even rows of stitching to
    be effective.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/06_floss.jpg" alt="decorative stitching along lapels" width="109" height="107" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Floss stitching</h4>
  <p>Fancy stitching can be made with floss, or knitting silk. It can be made
    in straight rows or can be stitched into squares or diamond shapes. All lines
    should be marked on the wrong side of the goods for the stitching or a true
    gauge is used.</p>
  <p>Wind the bobbin of the sewing machine with heavy floss. Loosen the upper
    tension only and stitch from the wrong side. The effect will be similar to
    embroidery, the upper thread can be of a different color or black to make
    even a more effective trimming. Bands stitched in squares for Tuxedo fold
    on a coat of silk with cuffs and pockets to match is most effective. A collar
    or yoke stitched with several rows of floss also is effective. Belt tabs
    and trimming insets can also be made. It is advisable to practice on a sample
    before stitching the garment.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/06_hemstitched.jpg" alt="strips with hemstitching" width="82" height="145" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Hemstitched
strips</h4>
  <p>Attractive organdy trimming can be made by hemstitching two or more colors
    together, using narrow strips of equal width, and stitching them into a seam.
    The hemstitching is then split into a piquot edge and will not be visible.
    Collars, cuffs or sash ends can be made in this manner.</p>
  <h4>    Home
hemstitching </h4>
  <p>Hemstitching can be made at home. Folded tissue paper can be placed between
    the material of the seams. Both tensions should be loose. The paper is removed
    after the seam is stitched. The sides are then pressed back and stitched
    at the edge.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/06_homemade.jpg" alt="long u-shaped wire to use as a tool to asssist hemstitching" width="122" height="196" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Homemade
appliance</h4>
  <p>A hemstitching appliance can be made at home by a handy man. (See illustration.)
    Use an eighth-inch heavy wire, bending the ends into a double bar, very close
    (one-eighth inch) together. It should be six to eight inches long.</p>
  <p>This bar is placed between the two edges of material on the seam when stitching
    and the needle travels between the two sides of the bar. The curved end is
    out in front and the open end of the bar is under the presser foot so that
    it can be drawn through the material as the seam progresses. Better results
    will be secured if the two edges are first stitched together plain, then
    the bar is used as close as possible to the first stitching. This makes it
    possible to make the hemstitching more evenly spaced.</p>
  <p>After the seam is finished, pull out the outer stitching, trim off the outer
    seam, press. back the sides and flat-stitch the edges. Various effects can
    be secured by practice.</p>
  <h4>    Tailored pockets </h4>
  <p>Tailored pockets in dresses make an effective trimming. (See <a href="hsc-5.html#pockets">lesson
      on pockets</a>.)
    Pockets and bound buttonholes will be all that is required to take the dress
    out of the homemade class.</p>
<h4>Velvet </h4>
  <p>Velvet or velveteen is often used for collars and cuffs on tailored dresses,
    often in a contrasting material. It is advisable to understand the handling
    of velvet before using it for trimming. (See <a href="hsc-6.html">lesson on
    materials</a>.)</p>
  <h4>    Fur </h4>
  <p>Fur is used for trimming in various ways, often in banding.</p>
  <p>Fur is used in small quantities on a dress. A touch of fur is all that is
    required for smartness.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/06_flowers.jpg" alt="fabric flowers formed from square, stitched and gathered" width="132" height="161" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Flowers</h4>
  <p>Flowers can be made of material to be used as an effective trimming. They
    can be made of organdy or silk, of ribbon or of various crocheted effects.
    The material folds and rolls beautifully on the bias. The easiest and most
    effective quick flower is made from a square of silk, folded cornerwise,
    gathered across the corner and drawn up into a cup shape. Several of these
    petals are made and overlapped into a bud.</p>

  <h3>      <b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="commercially" id="commercially"></a></font></b>SEWING COMMERCIALLY</h3>
  <h4>      Why dressmakers
    fail </h4>
  <p>There are many women who desire to earn money by sewing but realize that
    they do not have sufficient knowledge of the subject to enable them to conduct
    a profitable business. The amateur dressmaker often makes a failure when
    she sews by the &quot;hit-and-miss&quot; method. She does not understand
    the fitting problems encountered and through her errors her profits are &quot;ripped&quot; away
    and she finally loses her best customers.</p>
  <p>It is surprising how quickly a customer will sense the inability of the
    dressmaker even though she may know nothing about sewing. She at least knows
    how clothes should look and should &quot;feel&quot;, as perfect fittings
    always insures a comfortable dress. A misfit dress may &quot;look&quot; right
    but may &quot;feel&quot; most uncomfortable and the customer will never return.
    Therefore the dressmaker must understand her business.</p>
  <h4>    How to succeed </h4>
  <p>Success in sewing commercially is not in the ability to wildly slash into
    material but it is in learning to proceed step by step to eliminate all lost
    motion. This has been proven by the dress manufacturers. It is necessary
    to know how to handle different materials, what to do first, where to look
    for mistakes and how to avoid them, and how to secure the desired result
    the first time and avoid ripping. Many methods taught may secure the result
    eventually but the struggle is too great for commercial purposes.</p>
  <p>A dressmaker can earn as she learns. There will be no overhead expense as
    she can work at home and do the work herself. She should at least take a
    complete course in sewing, such as given in these lessons. The lessons will
    be a constant source of information as she encounters problems that have
    not appeared before. She should have a thorough understanding of the subject
    of fitting different figures, not only through pattern alterations but also
    fitting the actual dress after it is assembled and on the woman. These 80
    problems are all explained and illustrated in our <a href="hsc-7.html">lessons
    on &quot;Fitting.&quot;</a></p>
  <h4>    Confidence </h4>
  <p>The dressmaker that instills confidence in her customer is the one who can
    copy any illustration. Many smartly dressed women like to design their own
    clothes and must hire a dressmaker to make them. This dressmaker must cut
    her own patterns and can charge for the service. She is the exclusive dressmaker;
    her garments are distinctive. The customer is willing to pay a greater price
    for being able to have the garment she wants and have it made correctly.
    Well dressed women do not wear a cheap grade of clothes and do not object
    to paying for service rendered.</p>
  <h4>    Fitting </h4>
  <p>The dressmaker that can FIT is the one who succeeds. A well fitted dress
    is a pleasure to wear and the customer will return. Hard-to-fit women are
    driven to the ready to wear departments because they cannot fit themselves.
    The needle work may be exquisite and the style of the latest but if the dress
    is not comfortable and does not fit, the customer is not satisfied and will
    not only not return but will advertise the fact. A satisfied customer is
    the dressmaker's best advertisement.</p>
  <h4>    Types of figures </h4>
  <p>The successful dressmaker must also study and understand individual types
    of figures and be able to suggest the best styles for them. This is a service
    that should be rendered only by the better priced dressmaker, for it often
    requires some time to select the desired pattern. The cheap dressmaker should
    ask the customer to select her pattern and bring it with the material. It
    is not necessary to know how to sketch to be an exclusive dressmaker. The
    many fashion books, both of the French and American publishers, will furnish
    all the ideas that are necessary, but it is essential to be able to harmonize
    different sleeves with dresses, different collars, or trimmings. This is
    often necessary even when the pattern is purchased; it must be changed to
    meet the needs of the individual.</p>
  <h4>    Tact is essential </h4>
  <p>Tact is also an essential of the successful dressmaker. She must have a
    quick and intuitive apprehension of what is necessary to hold the confidence
    of her customer. She must have an ever-ready discernment in avoiding any
    action or statement that would offend. One misspoken phrase may be the cause
    of losing a good customer. She must always seem to be following the suggestions
    while in reality she has completely changed the ideas that her customer had
    when she arrived. For example: The customer arrives with the determination
    to have a certain dress. She has the material and the pattern. You see immediately
    that the pattern is not suitable for the figure. It will make her appear
    larger than her size. Do not say immediately &quot;This pattern will not
    do, you will have to select another one, this will make you look too big.&quot; But
    rather say &quot;Mrs. ________, I believe that if you had of selected one
    of the straighter line patterns that this dress would have been so slenderizing.&quot; You
    have touched her sensitive spot, her size; she wants to look smaller and
    will do anything to accomplish that aim. She will even discard that pattern
    and buy another one. But if she had heard the first remark she would have
    said, &quot;Well, if you do not want to make it I will take it to Mrs. _________&quot;</p>
  <h4>    Patience </h4>
  <p>Never lose patience and never lose your temper with a customer, assume that
    she is always right. Make her think so if possible, if she insists that a
    pin should be moved, and you are just as certain that it will ruin the dress,
    move it, but make it as it should be later, if necessary.</p>
  <h4>    Neatness </h4>
  <p>The dressmaker should advertise her business by wearing neat, well made,
    and well fitted dresses. They need not be of fine material but she should
    make them herself. The customer will ask, &quot;Did you make that dress?&quot; She
    will surely be judged by her appearance.</p>
  <h4>    Business at
home </h4>
  <p>As the dressmaker usually starts her business in her home, do not fail to
    always keep in mind that the home is also the place of business and treat
    it as such. Odors of cooking should be carefully avoided, the reception room
    should be cleaned early in the morning to be neat and clean when the early
    customer arrives. There should be a waiting room where she will not have
    to encounter the family if she comes in the evening. This is not a social
    affair and she will appreciate it if you do not treat it as such. Attend
    strictly to business.</p>
  <h4>    Sewing by
the day </h4>
  <p>There must always be a beginning and as there are many things to learn to
    gain confidence, it is often wise to sew in homes by the day for a time until
    you have established the value of your work. One or two good customers will
    recommend you to others until your time will be filled. As a beginner, the
    wages will be small but you can consider it more as an apprenticeship and
    plan to actually start your own business when your own confidence is established.
    Dressmaking in the homes of others will also bring in many problems of alterations
    and remodeling that are all good lessons in dressmaking. Consider them as
    such for they are often nerve-trying. Study each problem as it presents itself
    and remember how it was done and why. This knowledge may be of value to you
    later.</p>
  <h4>    How to advertise </h4>
  <p>A dressmaking business can be advertised in a small way. A small advertisement
    in the &quot;Situations Wanted&quot; may bring good results as a beginning.
    Returns may be slow, but if only two or three good customers respond, they
    will build the business if your services are what they expect. Printed announcements
    are excellent to send out to a selected mailing list. The quality of the
    announcement should represent the business that you expect to secure. Good
    customers expect good advertising and will expect good work from the advertiser.
    Do not mention prices. Secure the interest first, set the price last. Never
    set a price over the 'phone or upon the first arrival of the customer. Dresses
    differ as much in making as in materials. They will always say that &quot;It
    is a simple plain dress&quot; and it may turn out to be very complicated
    and you have given the price without knowing. Tell her that you cannot set
    the price without seeing the material and pattern, or offer a range of prices
    for the cheapest to the highest priced.</p>
  <h4>    The Particular
Customer </h4>
  <p>It is the particular woman today who hires her clothes made. If she is satisfied
    with dresses like those her neighbor wears, or if she is easily fitted, she
    often buys them ready-made. But if the alterations cost as much as the garment
    and it is then not satisfactory, she prefers to have the dressmaker make
    it, and you will find her particular and with ideas of her own. The dressmaker
    must be tactful enough to cope with these customers.</p>
  <h4>    Judging price </h4>
  <p>Before starting in business, it is well to time the hours spent on making
    your own clothes and then decide on the price per hour you intend to charge
    for your time. It will take longer time to make a dress as a beginner than
    when experienced in sewing. For this reason the cost per hour cannot be computed
    too high. More money will be made as experience is gained. It is better to
    make fewer dresses at a greater price and save your health than to make many
    dresses at a cheaper price and work till the wee small hours of the morning
    to make a living.</p>
  <h4>    Check cost of
ready-to-wear </h4>
  <p>Shop in the better dress departments of the department stores, learn the
    prices of the better grade dresses, for this is the kind that the dressmaker
    will make. Then shop for the same material in the fabric departments and
    learn the price of the materials of these dresses and compute the amount
    of material that is in the dress. Subtract one from the other and you will
    have the price for the sewing if you want to compete with the ready-to-wear
    departments. This same comparison does not balance when figured against the
    cheap ready-to-wear dresses. These dresses are made by pitifully cheap labor
    and cannot be equated by the dressmaker. Not enough of the cheap material
    dresses are made by the dressmaker to pay to set a price. Sew only the better
    fabrics and learn to do the work sufficiently well to demand an adequate
    price for labor.</p>
  <h4>    Learn the
business </h4>
  <p>There are very few <strong>good</strong> dressmakers. There have been so many so-called dressmakers
    who have known nothing about fitting and have ruined the reputation of all
    dressmakers with their ruined goods for the customer, whose motto is &quot;Beware
    of the dressmaker.&quot; She has had so much material ruined that she is
    cautious. So <strong>learn</strong> the business before your reputation as a dressmaker is
    also ruined. Build up the confidence of your customers. They are willing
    to give you a trial but will not return if they are not satisfied.</p>
  <h4>    How to raise
prices </h4>
  <p>It is always possible to raise the price of your work by eliminating the
    cheaper dresses. Tell your customers that you are now taking only the better
    dresses. This will also build confidence. In the beginning it is necessary
    to accept any and all work that comes to the sewing room but as work increases,
    the undesirable work and the undesirable customers can be eliminated by being
    too busy to do the work.</p>
  <h4>    How to gauge
work </h4>
  <p>Keep work two weeks ahead if possible before you secure help. It requires
    at least two weeks' work in the shop to keep the cutting and fittings running
    evenly. The dress will be planned with the customer, will later be cut and
    basted and laid aside for the first fitting before any more work can be done
    on it. The customer may disappoint you for her appointment, and other work
    must take its place. The customer should never be reprimanded for not keeping
    her appointment, although it may have inconvenienced the dressmaker.</p>
  <h4>    Health </h4>
  <p>Sewing is a pleasure if all goes well and the hours are not too long. It
    is poor business to work far into the night to complete a dress for a thoughtless
    customer. If sewing is to be a vocation for several years, the health must
    be considered. When help is needed, it is best to secure a young girl who
    is willing to learn your methods and take your dictation. Teach her to do
    the hand sewing that takes so much valuable time. If the sewing room has
    sufficient work to hire several women, one will be found more efficient than
    the other for certain work. This special work should be given to that woman.</p>
  <h4>    Self-confidence </h4>
  <p>Self-confidence will be the first thing to master and this will be developed
    by actually working out the. problems as they are given in the lessons. As
    the problems are classified, the simile dresses can be made first and as
    the more difficult dresses are made, the more difficult problems can be mastered.
    Refer to the lessons for the instructions as all problems are covered.</p>
  <h4>    Simple dresses
first </h4>
  <p>Simple dresses can be made for friends while learning. If you have previously
    been sewing many things for yourself, you can do remodeling as this will
    teach you many things in designing.</p>
  <p>As the lessons progress, new garments can be made, making the wash dress
    first and later attempting the silk, and last the coats. Coats require very
    accurate work and will be good training. Good tailoring methods produce good
    results in dressmaking.</p>
  <h4>    Fitting essential </h4>
  <p>After the fitting lessons are learned, many avenues are opened. Sewing can
    then be started in earnest, you can do cutting and fitting, with the customer
    finishing the dress. You can also be in a position to teach others the art,
    commercializing on the knowledge that you have learned. You can thus pay
    for your lessons in a short time and at the same time be learning more about
    the business.</p>
  <h4>    Remodeling </h4>
  <p>Remodeling is interesting if one can make the most of the goods at hand.
    This usually requires clever manipulation to make a garment. If there is
    sufficient material, it is always possible to make something of it. Never
    try to make a larger or a longer dress from one that is too small, but a
    smaller or shorter garment can be made.</p>
  <h4>    Shopping for
customers </h4>
  <p>Do not shop for your customers unless an additional charge is made. Insist
    that the customer matches the materials and selects the trimmings, giving
    them suggestions. It is only the exclusive dressmaker charging high prices
    for her garments who can furnish materials. All materials should be purchased
    by the customer and also the threads and straps, or findings, as they are
    called. If the dressmaker furnishes these extras, an additional charge for
    them should be made.</p>
  <h4>    Exercise </h4>
  <p>A dressmaker should take some outdoor exercise every day; a brisk walk to
    the store is better than no fresh air (and when away from the house no one
    can call he). That is the one disadvantage of having a dressmaking shop in
    the home. She, like a doctor, is always on duty and as sewing is very confining,
    it is necessary to health to take a walk each day. Start working earlier
    rather than working late at night.</p>
  <h4>    Nervousness </h4>
  <p>Avoid allowing the customer to press you for service immediately. She may
    demand that the dress be made immediately, then will not wear it for a week
    after it is finished. The woman who has a dressmaker usually has many dresses
    and will respect you for keeping her waiting. If everything seems to go wrong
    with the dress, it is a sure indication that you are nervous. Lay the dress
    aside and do something else for a time. When the dress is taken up again
    all will be well and sewing will run smoothly.</p>
  <h4>    Light </h4>
  <p>Good light is important in any sewing room whether you sew at home or go
    out by the day. Do not face the direct light, especially the sunny side of
    the room, but rather have the light at the window to one side. As one usually
    sits at the machine and sews, place the machine to the side of the window,
    a north window if possible. Place the machine so that the light falls to
    the left of the machine on the needle.</p>
  <h4>    Cutting table
for work room </h4>
  <p>A good cutting table is essential. It should be 40 inches wide and as long
    as possible. The top can be made of rough board and it should be covered
    with one solid piece of linoleum. Any table should be covered so as to make
    a smooth surface where the material can be held down with pins if necessary.
    The table should be higher than a dining table so that the worker can conveniently
    work without leaning over. Any table can be set on blocks or cans to bring
    it to the desired height. A light frame could be made by a carpenter and
    covered with wall board. It could then be placed over the ordinary table
    and removed when necessary.</p>
  <h4>    Ironing board </h4>
  <p>The ironing board and iron must occupy a place in the sewing room, for it
    will be used often. It can be placed under a drop electric light if an extra
    window is not available. The cutting table can be placed in a corner with
    the drop light over it, or in the center of the room if possible.</p>
  <h4>    Sewing machine </h4>
  <p>Keep the sewing machine well oiled with sewing machine oil, not the household
    oil that is recommended for all purposes. It is too heavy and will soon clog
    the machine. If the machine runs heavy, oil it well with kerosene and run
    for a few minutes. This will cut the dry oil. Then oil with good oil; if
    used steadily, it should be oiled every few days. When cleaning off the surplus
    oil, wipe the bar above the needle. This part cannot be seen and is usually
    forgotten and it is from this place that the oil drops on the goods.</p>
  <h4>    Fitting room </h4>
  <p>The fitting room should be equipped with a long mirror so the customer can
    see the full length of her dress. If possible this room should be separated
    from the waiting room, as many customers bring their friends to the fittings
    and the extra suggestions often cause confusion. The light should fall on
    the customer or a good light directly on the mirror. A small platform raised
    six inches off the floor is convenient for hanging skirts. All fitting should
    be done in front of a mirror. The dressmaker should look in the glass at
    the dress. The mirror will show defects that cannot be detected with the
    eye.</p>
  <h4>    Fitting </h4>
  <p>Stand back of the customer for all fitting if possible. The customer wants
    to watch the fitting in the mirror and does not want her view obstructed.
    Fit the dress right side out and make all alterations later. (See right-side
    basting.) Set the sleeves from the right side, hang the skirt according to
    the directions given in &quot;Hanging skirts.&quot; The fitting of the hips
    should be tested as the customer is seated, so provide a straight chair for
    the fitting room. The dressmaker should fit the dress as she thinks best
    and then ask the customer if it is satisfactory. Never ask her advice as
    to the method of fitting. She is paying the dressmaker for this work and
    she should know what is to be done.</p>
  <h4>    The hem </h4>
  <p>The length of the hem should be decided by the customer. She may ask your
    advice about the length, it will then be advisable to pin up the length suggested
    and see the effect. If the customer is changeable, it may be best to pin
    up the hem all around as she may change her mind.</p>
  <h4>    Affirmative
answers </h4>
  <p>Always converse with the customer in complimentary terms about the dress,
    but be businesslike and not gushing. Ask all questions so that the answer
    will be in the affirmative. If the neck should be lower, ask if she does
    not think that the neck would be more becoming if it were a trifle lower.
    Make a definite assertion and let her confirm it. This instills confidence
    in the mind of the customer.</p>
  <h4>    Appointments </h4>
  <p>Every sewing room should have an appointment book. All appointments should
    be written, the date and the name, and the hour for the fitting. Opposite
    the name, write the pattern number decided upon and the book from which it
    was selected, also the number of the page in the book. This is important
    as the busy dressmaker may confuse the designs. If a price has been set on
    the work, this also should be noted.</p>
  <h4>    Measurement
slips </h4>
  <p>Measurement slips should be provided for measurements of the customer. Several
    can be made by hand with carbon paper. Use the <a href="hsc-7.html#chart">set
    of measurements</a> given
    with these lessons. Place the name and address of the customer on this slip,
    also the phone number. Keep this list of names and addresses; it may be.
    valuable years later.</p>
  <h4>    Pattern books </h4>
  <p>It is always necessary to have several pattern books in the waiting room
    to use for selecting patterns or designs. Keep only the latest books; too
    many books are confusing. The customer will think it is necessary to look
    through all the books, no matter how many there are to see. If just the latest
    books are in evidence, she will select more quickly. Keep the old books in
    the work room for reference. They may be valuable for ideas when it is necessary
    to change the design of a pattern.</p>
  <h4>    French books </h4>
  <p>For the better class of customers, it is advisable to have one or more French
    books in reserve from which to select. These dresses should cost more for
    the making as the pattern must be designed and cut and the pattern is usually
    of intricate design, and the dress will be harder to make. Do not offer these
    books to customers who want cheap dresses. They will select the French design
    but will not pay the price.</p>
  <h4>    Finished fitting </h4>
  <p>It is always best to have a finished fitting. It may be necessary to change
    a strap or make some minor alteration and will make a more satisfied customer.
    The garment should then be carefully packed in a small suit box. These are
    sold by large paper companies by the hundred. It will pay to place an order
    for at least a hundred together with a ream of cheap tissue paper to use
    for packing.</p>
  <h4>    Packing </h4>
  <p>To pack the dress: lay it out on the table with the front of the dress uppermost,
    sleeves out to the side. Pick it up at the center front so that the first
    fold will be down the center front with the back on the inside. Lay this
    flat. Then fold the circular part of the side of the skirt over to the front
    and the sleeves to the front, making the dress as narrow as the width of
    the box, keeping it as flat as possible. Place a sheet of tissue paper in
    the box, lay in the bottom edge of the skirt and fold the skirt back to the
    width of the box. If the dress is sheer, crush tissue paper and place between
    the folds. Lay the dress back and forth in the box-like pleats, placing the
    neck and collar of the dress on the top with the tissue between the folds.</p>

<h3><font
			face="Arial"><b><em><a name="sleeves" id="sleeves"></a></em></b></font>Setting Sleeves</h3>
  <p>      Perfect sleeves Sleeves must be cut perfectly. They should be cut together
      if possible to eliminate any possibility of cutting two sleeves for the
      same arm. Place the right sides of the material together for cutting. If
      one sleeve has been cut, turn the remaining material over to the other
      side and repin the pattern to both sleeves. Do not remove the one sleeve;
      pin them both to the pattern. The pattern will be used later for marking
the sewing lines.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/04_match.jpg" alt="armhole with side seams and shoulder seams joined" width="132" height="148" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Match armhole
and sleeve</h4>
  <p>A simple method of testing the correct sleeve to set into a certain armhole
    is to turn the sleeve right side out, slide the sleeve into the arm that
    is to wear it, then find the matching armhole. Place a pin on the back or
    front of the sleeve cap for identification later.</p>
  <p>Set the right side of the sleeve to the right side of the dress at the underarm
    seam. This is easily done if the underarm seam is pinned first. Open both
    seams, flatten them together, and pin. Do the same with the other sleeve.
    This will check to determine if both sleeves have been made for the same
    arm. This is a common error.</p>
  <h4>    Set-in sleeve </h4>
  <p>A closely fitted sleeve set into a round armhole should be set into the
    armhole without gathers at the top of the sleeve, even though there will
    be some fullness on the sides. This fullness on the sides of the sleeve cap
    is necessary for smooth fitting over the curve of the arm and will make the
    armhole smaller than the sleeve cap. This fullness will be worked into the
    sleeve by the method given, turning the sleeve back over the hand when pinning
    to the armhole.</p>
  <p>All sleeves set into round armholes will be set in this manner, even though
    they are full gathered sleeves. The full sleeves will be gathered evenly
    as directed in the pattern and will be pinned to the armhole as directed
    in this lesson by turning the sleeve back over the hand.</p>
  <h4>    Armholes </h4>
  <p>The armhole of the dress should be held in shape by the sleeve or should
    be stayed with machine stitching (not hand sewing). The armhole should be
    stayed before the garment is fitted or it will be stretched out of shape;
    the more the garment is tried on without the sleeve or without staying the
    armhole, the more the armhole will be stretched.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/04_match-lines.jpg" alt="bodice front with dotted line along sewing line of armhole" width="88" height="169" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Match sewing
lines</h4>
  <p> It is important to match the sewing lines. When setting a sleeve. Many
    sleeves are made too large for the armhole because too much seam has been
    allowed.
    The same is true of the armhole; it becomes smaller as the seam is widened.
    Increasing an outer circle of the sleeve cap lengthens the outer line, and
    decreasing the inner circle of the armhole shortens the line. Therefore,
    cut small seams when cutting armholes and sleeves, not over three-eighths
    inch.
    Fit the pattern, and an extra allowance will not be necessary. If an extra
  allowance has been made, mark the sewing line by our quick method.</p>
  <h4>    No gathers
in sleeves</h4>
  <p>The modern method of setting a plain sleeve into the armhole requires no
    gathers, even though there is a slight fullness in the sleeve cap. The old-fashioned
    method originated with the full top sleeve, which required a gathering thread
    and all the fullness eased to the top.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/04_fullness.jpg" alt="one-piece sleeve, flat, with arrows pointing to fullness of sleeve cap" width="132" height="135" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />No fullness
at the top</h4>
  <p>Plain sleeves have no fullness at the top, for it is impossible to successfully
    ease in fullness along a straight thread of goods. Fullness cannot be eased
    out only as a bias and the top of a plain sleeve cap is on a straight thread
    and not a bias. Fullness will pucker when eased across the top of the sleeve.
    The underarm curve of the sleeve is also cut on a straight thread of material,
    which makes it impractical to ease in fullness at the underarm of the sleeve.
    Therefore, all fullness in the cap of the sleeve must be eased in on the
    slanting side of the sleeve cap, which is cut on the bias. The back and front
    of the side sleeve caps will absorb all the fullness easily.</p>
<h4>    Factory method</h4>
  <p> All factory-made dresses have the plain sleeves set in without gathers,
    and all the fullness is eased in on the sides of the sleeve cap without gathers.
  No fullness is placed at the top of the sleeve.</p>
  <p>The sleeve will be set in with pins. After it has been pinned to the underarm
    seam, pin the sleeve to the armhole at one and one-half inches to the front
    of the underarm seam and one and one-half inches to the back of the seam.
    This will make it pinned flat to the armhole for three inches at the bottom.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/04_pins.jpg" alt="sleeve pinned into armhole, pins on inside" width="132" height="167" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Pins crosswise</h4>
  <p> Place all pins crosswise to the armhole and hold the sleeve uppermost with
  the armhole to the back.</p>
  <p>It is now necessary to fold the sleeve to find the center at the top. Place
    a pin for the mark. Fold the armhole <strong>flat</strong> (not stretched) to find the center
    and place a pin. Then pin these two centers together, holding the sleeve
    toward you. Place the pins crosswise to the seam.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/04_three-inches.jpg" alt="sleeve folded, with arrow pointing at center" width="132" height="174" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Three inches
plain</h4>
  <p> There will also be three inches across the top of the sleeve plain. One
    and one-half inches on each side of the center pin.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/04_important.jpg" alt="arrow pointing to matching seams of sleeve and side seam on armhole, showing even fullness" width="132" height="158" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Important</h4>
  <p>Remember: <strong>Three inches</strong> at the top and <strong>three inches</strong> at the bottom of the
    sleeve are plain, and if the center has been correctly determined, there
    will be an equal amount of fullness on both the back and front of the cap
    of the sleeve.</p>
  <p>As you now look into the sleeve it is down inside of the armhole with fullness
    on both sides. It will now be reversed and will be turned out with the sleeve
    out and the armhole inside the sleeve.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    Turn the
sleeve cap</h4>
  <p><img src="images/04_turn.jpg" alt="sleeve being turned" width="132" height="152" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Place the thumbs inside the sleeve as it rests inside the armhole. Turn
    the fingers up and the hands back so that the palms of the hands are outward.
    This will turn the sleeve out, and the armhole will be under the sleeve.
    Do not turn back the whole sleeve. It is only the sleeve cap that will be
    turned back. The sleeve will now be resting as it will be when worn over
    the shoulder. The fullness had almost all disappeared.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    Remaining
fullness</h4>
  <p><img src="images/04_remaining.jpg" alt="sleeve, insideout, showing pins to ease fullness" width="132" height="146" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />All the remaining fullness will be worked out with pins on the <strong>bias</strong> edge
    of the sleeve cap. As the sleeve is turned back over the hands, place a pin
    in the center of the fullness on one side of the sleeve. Then place a pin
    in the center of the remaining fullness on each side of that pin and continue
    until all the fullness is worked out. The pins will be an inch apart. Repeat
    on the other side.</p>
  <h4>    Uneven </h4>
  <p>If there is more fullness on one side of the sleeve than the other, then
    the center was not found correctly. The center at the top of the sleeve will
    have to be changed to even up the fullness. On very large sleeves some of
    the fullness can be eased a trifle lower to the underarm, as this type of
    arm often has a small armhole and a large arm.</p>
  <h4>    Test </h4>
  <p>The sleeve can now be tested for perfect setting. Keep the sleeve wrong
    side out and slide the fingers into the armhole and flatten out the sleeve.
    Hold it in a rather stretched position to determine if there will be any
    drawing in the cap. If there is, there will be diagonal lines running from
    the pins that are wrong.</p>
  <p>Remove the pins and the sleeve will slip to the correct place. Repin to
    position. There should be no drawing in the sleeve as the hands are held
    into the shoulder and slightly stretched. Clip the curve of the armhole before
    stitching.</p>
  <h4>    Stitch </h4>
  <p>The sleeve can now be stitched into the armhole without basting if one is
    an experienced sewer. If not, baste to position and then machine stitch with
    the sleeve on top. Open the shoulder seam and spread it back and away from
    the armhole as the back edge will draw if stitched into the seam.</p>
  <h4>    Remove the pins </h4>
  <p>Remove the pins as the basting or the machine stitching approaches. The
    heads of the pins being placed outward makes this possible.</p>
  <h4 class="clear"><img src="images/04_too-much.jpg" alt="bodice front and back joined at shoulder seam, laid flat, with flat sleeve sewn into armhole" width="132" height="172" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Too much seam</h4>
  <p>Stitch on the sewing line of the pattern. If the seam is stitched too wide
    the sleeve will draw across the cap or the armhole will ripple. This also
    often happens when the inexperienced sewer attempts to set a sleeve into
    the armhole without any fullness. If there is more fullness than can be stitched
    out smoothly, take an eighth-inch deeper seam. This will reduce the fullness.
    Too much fullness will also puff the sleeve, which is another indication
    of the seam being too narrow.</p>
  <p>Sleeves can be set into the armhole before the dress is joined at the underarm,
    as is done in factory-made dresses, but the above method will prove more
    helpful. Fullness is eased out on the bias section even with the factory
    method.</p>
  <h4>    Sleeves
    extending
to the neck</h4>
  <p>Saddle shoulders and epaulet sleeves are fitted at the underarm and all
    require some ease at the sleeve cap, but not as much as the set-in type.
    The fullness is equally distributed along the seam between the shoulder and
    armhole before the underarm seam is joined.</p>
  <h4>    Raglan </h4>
  <p>Raglan sleeves are looser and are not fitted up under the arm, hence do
    not require fullness in the sleeve cap but the underarm is looser.</p>
  <p>    Armhole finishes Never French-seam a sleeve into the armhole. The ease that
      is necessary in the finished stitching makes it very difficult to French-seam,
      as it is necessary to allow so much fullness on the first stitching that
      the importance of the final stitching is ignored. If there is not a great
      amount allowed on the first stitching it will all vanish with the second
      stitching and will draw the sleeve cap.</p>
  <p>Armhole seams should be pressed open and overcast on each side on all heavy
    material. Firm material may be picked if the seam is sufficiently wide for
    final pinking.</p>
  <h4>    Sheer materials </h4>
  <p>Sleeves made of sheer material may have the seams rolled for a finish, rolling
    under one edge and slip stitching it to the seam.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/04_right-side.jpg" alt="bodice being worn, with sleeve pinned into place and basted into position" width="132" height="185" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Right side
sleeve setting</h4>
  <p> It is often advisable to pin a sleeve into the armhole while the dress
    is on the customer. The edges of the sleeve cap are turned under and the
    sleeve is
    pinned to the dress just as it will be finished. To be able to baste this
    to place without removing the pins must be accomplished with right-side bastings.
  See rules for right-side basting.</p>
  <p>Practice setting a sleeve by using two crepe paper napkins or handkerchiefs.
    Fold one diagonally and pin to represent the sleeve cap. Fold the other in
    half on the straight grain of material and pin shut, making it one inch smaller
    than the diagonally folded napkin. The smaller one will represent the armhole
    and the larger one the sleeve. Slide the sleeve into the armhole and follow
    these directions as given.</p>

  <h3>    <b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="pleats" id="pleats"></a></font></b>PLEATS</h3>
  <h4>    Uses </h4>
  <p>Pleats are used both for trimming and to add fullness to the section in
    which they are placed. Single pleats are basted and made into the garment,
    while a series of pleats are usually made with a pleating machine.</p>
  <h4>    Length of
material</h4>
  <p>If pleating is to be sent to the pleater, the length to be pleated will
    b three times the length of the space to be filled. If a ten-inch space is
    to be filled, it will be necessary to prepare thirty inches to cover the
    ten-inch space. As the pleats do not overlap, it requires three inches of
    material for one inch of space.</p>
  <h4>    Hem pleats </h4>
  <p>All material that is to be pleated by the machine should be hemmed before
    it is pleated, as it is difficult to make a perfect hem in pleated material
    after it has been steamed.</p>
  <h4>    Width of pleats </h4>
  <p>Pleating is usually made on the lengthwise thread of the goods, and a uniform
    width is necessary to retain the straight thread down each pleat.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/04_seams-pleats-a.jpg" alt="pleats, showing one pleat with a seam along fold" width="132" height="118" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Seams in pleats</h4>
  <p>If pleated sections are to be made by hand, plan to have all joining seams
    on the underlap of the pleat. The seam is not pressed open only at the hem.</p>
  <p>There are several kinds of pleats, each being popular in its season of fashion.
    Plain pleats, knife pleats, box pleats, inverted box pleats, sunburst or
    fan pleats and accordion pleats are some of them.</p>
  <p class="clear"><img src="images/04_seams-pleats-b.jpg" alt="seam in box pleat" width="132" height="142" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />A box pleat is made with two pleats lapping in opposite directions
    with the fold of the joining pleats meeting on the wrong side of the garment.</p>
  <p class="clear"><img src="images/04_seams-pleats-c.jpg" alt="seam in inverted pleat" width="132" height="123" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />An inverted box pleat is made with the edges of the two pleats meeting on
    the right side of the goods. An inverted box pleat is often used at the end
    of skirt seams to produce fullness at the lower edge.</p>
<h4 class="clear">  Knife pleats</h4>
<p> <img src="images/04_knife.jpg" alt="knife pleats, with center box pleat" width="132" height="130" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Several plain pleats made by machine are termed &quot;knife&quot; pleats. There
  are several combinations that are often used on full pleated skirts. These
  pleats are made only by the professional pleater. Most large department stores
  will furnish this service.</p>
<p>A complete skirt made of knife pleating is usually made with a box pleat
    at the center front, with the knife pleats at the side, lapping to the back
    or in small groups with a center box. If all the pleats lap to the back and
    all the skirt is pleated, the material must be prepared and pleated open
    as in the rules for a middy skirt. The joining seam will be at the center
    back or under a pleat, and it will be basted to match the pleat edge.</p>
<p class="clear"><img src="images/04_sunburst.jpg" alt="sunburst pleats" width="125" height="133" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Sunburst pleats are made like the folds of a fan; they are sometimes termed &quot;fan
    pleats&quot;. These can be made at home as an inset and are very effective.
    (See <a href="hsc-6.html">lesson on trimmings</a>.)</p>
  <p class="clear"><img src="images/04_accordion.jpg" alt="accordion pleats" width="127" height="152" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Accordion pleats can be made only by machine. They are made so as to completely
    overlap one another and do not lie flat. They must be hemmed before they
    are pleated. A gathering thread is usually run across the top of the pleating
    to baste to position.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    Piquoted edges
for pleats</h4>
  <p> <img src="images/04_piquoted.jpg" alt="pleats with piquoted edges" width="132" height="141" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Hemstitching that is split for a piquot edge makes an excellent finish
    for narrow pleating. If a great quantity is to be used of one material, mark
    a
    large piece of material into the width desired, chalk mark the lines with
    a ruler. Allow three times the running length for the length to be made when
    pleated. Have these lines hemstitched and cut apart on the hemstitching.
    This
    will make the edge of each strip finished. It will require just half the
    amount of hemstitching if only every other line is hemstitched. This will
    leave one
    unfinished edge on each strip. Each line will be separated. Join the narrow
    strips <strong>under</strong> the folds of the pleats, matching the fold of the pleating rather
  than the thread of the goods, as the material may not pleat even.</p>
  <h4>    Pleated sections </h4>
  <p>Pleated sections should be made complete and pressed flat before they are
    set into the garment. If there is a box pleat in the back of the waist, finish
    it complete before sewing to the yoke. If there is a pleated section in the
    waist or skirt, finish it complete even to the final pressing before it is
    set into the garment. All pleats at the end of seams, such as a center box
    in front, should also be finished before the side seams are joined. (See
    other <a href="hsc-4.html#pleats">lesson on pleats</a>.) An intricate section of pleating may require right
    side basting to set the pleats correctly into the garment. (See rules for
    <a href="hsc-2.html#right">right side basting</a>.)</p>
  <h4>    Marking </h4>
  <p>Pleats are always marked on patterns either with lines or with symbols.
    These must be followed. Fold up the pattern into the pleats as they will
    be made in the garment so that the outer edge of the pleats can be located.
    This is the important mark to be followed. Mark this line in the material
    and also its matching line.</p>
  <h4>Crease-mark all
    pleats in single
sections</h4>
  <p>Pleats should all be crease-marked in single sections of material as they
    lie on the garment when finished. The best method of marking is to mark with
    creases made with a hot iron.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/04_crease-mark.jpg" alt="crease marks made along pleats" width="132" height="172" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Crease-mark
the pleats</h4>
  <p>Some makes of patterns have printed lines and other makes have lines of
    perforations to show where material is to be folded to make pleats. A simple
    way to lay the pleats in the material is to pin the pattern to the fabric
    along these lines. Then lay the pleats in both pattern and material and crease-mark
    with the iron or with the fingers. (See <a href="hsc-2.html#marking">lesson
    on marking seams</a>.)</p>
  <h4>    Chalk mark
the pleats</h4>
  <p> If this method is not used there must be some kind of a straight line to
    follow. Chalk-mark the goods on the right side of the dress, making a long
    line with
    the yardstick the full length of the pleat. This outer line will later be
    folded back and pressed for a crease on the edge before it is basted to the
    pleat.
    This keen edge is so necessary for perfect work and it requires less time
    for creasing than it does to fold under a wiry piece of material for basting.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">Box pleat set in</h4>
  <p>A pleated section is <img src="images/04_box-pleat-b.jpg" alt="set-in section to form pleat" width="132" height="136" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />often set <img src="images/04_box-pleat-a.jpg" alt="skirt with box pleat for kick pleat" width="72" height="181" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />into a slash in the skirt which requires
    perfect tailoring to make the point perfect. The small pleated section is
    marked with a crease down the center. This line will be used later.</p>
  <p>If the pleats are finished to a point, the seam must be taken very narrow
    on the skirt side, graduating to an even narrower width at the top and to
    within two or three threads of the point. The seam is an even width the full
    length of the inset. Stitch from the slash side of the seam. The pleated
    section should extend a half inch above the top of the point.</p>
  <p>After the pleated section is stitched to the slash, press the seam open
    to make a perfect turning. The pleat will turn back on the seam, rather than
    back in a fold of the pleat. After the seam has been pressed open turn back
    the pleat at the edge and baste flat and press. Do the same to the other
    side.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/04_join-center.jpg" alt="stabilizing stitching over top of kick pleat on skirt" width="73" height="187" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Join to center</h4>
  <p> Place the skirt section right side up on the table or over the basting
    board and place the center crease of the pleated section to the center of
    the slash.
    Then baste the edges of the pleats to meet this crease. Cross-stitch the
    edge at the top so that when the final pressing is given, the pleats will
    not spread.</p>
  <p>If it is too difficult to make a perfect point, open the point and join
    with right side basting.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/04_inset-pleats.jpg" alt="inset pleat onto skirt for kick pleat" width="89" height="192" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Inset pleats with
square top</h4>
  <p> Pleats set into slashed openings can be made with pleats on each side of
    the slot. The pleated section is creased down the center. Slash the opening
    to
    within a half-inch of the top, clip to the sides of the points so as to make
  the seam one-half inch wide.</p>
  <p>Join the pleated section to each side. Press open the edge seams; baste
    the pleat back at the edge. Bring the pleats over to meet the center crease
    made in this pleated section before setting into the skirt. Baste flat. Turn
    under the point at the top and slip-stitch to the pleats. Press all flat.
    Stitch the top of the pleats to place from the wrong side, following the
    crease under the point.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/04_marking-hems.jpg" alt="skirt with kick pleat basted closed, with hem marked" width="79" height="188" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Marking hems
of pleats</h4>
  <p> This is one of the tricks of the tailor's trade and it is necessary to
    make the pleats all fall on an even line at the lower edge.</p>
  <p>All pleats should be basted to the bottom of the open hem and will remain
    basted until after the skirt is hung and the hem is pressed up. The pleats
    are then pressed up on the hem line as they are basted shut. The bastings
    are then removed and the crease will be followed for the hem. This will make
    a perfect hem along the lower edge of the pleats, and will make the back
    edge of the pleat a trifle shorter than the front. This is necessary for
    perfect hanging.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    Marking
box pleats</h4>
  <p> Box pleats must have a center crease. Press mark the center line and also
    the outer edge of the pleat, as this center line will be used later when
    basting.</p>
  <p>An inverted pleat should be carefully made; the edges must be straight and
    should meet perfectly. The pleat should be made in the material while the
    section lies flat. It must be made complete and flat stitched before it is
    joined to another section.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/04_center-box.jpg" alt="back view of inside of skirt with center box-pleat marked, and side view of additional fabric added to center back seam to allow box pleat to be formed" width="132" height="144" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Center box cut
    in one with
the skirt</h4>
  <p> All lines of the pleat should be marked with creases if possible. If the
    material cannot be creased, draw a chalk line with a long ruler and thread
    tack. The
    back edge of the large folds which will be the back center of the pleat should
    be marked with a crease to make it straight, as this will be the line that
  will be matched with the two folds of the pleats as they meet.</p>
  <p>After the back and edges are marked, open the pleat, place it flat on the
    table and baste the edges of the pleats to the center line of the fold. Baste
    the full length of the pleat and do not remove the bastings until the garment
    is to be hemmed.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/04_separate-back.jpg" alt="inside back view of skirt with separate back piece added for pleat" width="80" height="185" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Separate back
section</h4>
  <p> A box pleat can be made with a separate section at the back. This is often
    a saving of goods, as this pleat is not cut on a fold.</p>
  <p>Mark the edges of the pleats and baste together if pleat is at the lower
    part of the skirt. Press the seam to one side to crease for perfect stitching.
    Machine stitch as far as desired to the top of the pleat. Press the seam
    open and flat.</p>
  <p>With the skirt section wrong side up, slide the basting board or magazine
    under one side of the pleat. When the back pleat section is placed to position,
    baste it to the pleat as the pleat rests flat on the basting board. If the
    basting board is not used the stitches will be caught to the front of the
    skirt. The flat surface will permit the pleat to lie perfectly flat with
    no puckers. After the side seams of the pleat are stitched, press the pleat
    flat. Do not press open the seams. The only part of a pleat seam that is
    pressed open is that portion inside of the hem.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/04_stitch-across.jpg" alt="back view of pleat on skirt showing reinforcing at top" width="75" height="184" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Stitch across top</h4>
  <p>All box pleats that do not extend to the top of the skirt should be stitched
    across the top of the pleat. This line will follow the pattern indication,
    or if the material has a definite line of material or stripe, follow this
    line. Otherwise, the stitching can be straight across, pointed downward or
    upward. The upward point is more graceful and relieves the strain on the
    seams. Tack or tie the point well, as there is a great strain on this point
    in closely fitted skirts.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    Seams opened</h4>
  <p>When<img src="images/04_seams-opened.jpg" alt="back view of pleat on skirt showing reinforcing at top" width="78" height="187" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /> an under-lapping pleat is made at the bottom of the side seam of a
    skirt, it will be handled in the same manner, basting the side seam the full
    length to the lower edge of the skirt through the pleat. This basting will
    remain in the pleat until the final finish. This basting insures a keen edge
    on the pleat, a perfectly straight line down the side, and a perfect edge
    across the bottom of the pleat. It is necessary to baste the line to the
    bottom to secure accurate results. Pleated skirts for uniforms or middy skirts
    that are fitted at the waist are made by a different method.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    A middy skirt</h4>
  <p><img src="images/04_middy.jpg" alt="knife pleats with center box pleat, which will be formed into a middy skirt" width="132" height="109" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />The skirt is made open and flat. It is measured from the hip size for the
    amount of material to have pleated, and the hip size is also used for the
    measure to which the skirt is made. Serge is the material generally used.
    It is fifty-four inches wide and it will require two or more skirt lengths.
    One length is cut down the fold and half is sewed to each side of the front
    section so as not to have a seam near the front. Figure three times the size
    of the hips and this will give the correct amount to prepare for the pleating.</p>
  <h4>    Hem </h4>
  <p>The seams are pressed open. Press the goods down the center. Decide on the
    width of the pleat. Measure a center box pleat at this width. Mark all pleats
    at the hip line and also at the hem line. Chalk lines will connect these
    marks after the pleats are spaced. Do not mark at the waist as this will
    be changed later to fit closer.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/04_mark-pleats.jpg" alt="fabric with three pleats marked" width="132" height="138" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Mark the pleats</h4>
  <p>Work from the right side of the material. If the pleats are to be two inches
    wide, mark every two inches from the center front both at the hip line and
    at the hem line for the pleats. Place the material on the table and chalk
    mark each line the full length, using a yardstick.</p>
  <h4>    Pleat edges </h4>
  <p>Every fourth line will be the outer edge of a pleat counting from the first
    line drawn. It requires six inches to make one two-inch pleat, three times
    the width. Time will be saved if the outer edge of each pleat is pressed
    on the turning, picking up the goods along each six-inch line and as the
    material is folded double on this line, pressing it folded in one crease.
    Pin the ends to the press board if so desired. It will hold the ends of the
    pleat in place. Plan to make the joining seams of the material invisible.
    If the seams are pressed open they may be placed anywhere under the pleat.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/04_baste-hip.jpg" alt="knife pleats with center box pleat  with pleat edges basted" width="132" height="138" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Baste to the
hip line</h4>
  <p>Lay in the pleats with pins as marked, lapping all toward the center back.
    There will be a seam at the center back or under one of the back pleats after
    the skirt is finished. When they are all pinned to place at the hip line
    only, measure to see if the hips are the desired width. If not, slide the
    pleats either way a trifle to secure the correct hip size. When the correct
    size is secured, slide the basting board under the pleats and run a basting
    thread along the hip line to hold the pleats in position. Then baste each
    pleat to the bottom of the skirt following the chalk lines.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">Waist line</h4>
  <p>Use a belting<img src="images/04_waist-line-b.jpg" alt="stay tape at upper and lower hip lines" width="107" height="185" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /> or<img src="images/04_waist-line-a.jpg" alt="knife pleats pleats being tapered at top edge" width="117" height="176" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /> tape for a waist stay. (See <a href="#belts">lesson on
      belts</a>.) Work from
    the center. Pin the center box at the center of the belt. Pin each center
    back to the belting, measuring the exact belt size. There should be an extension
  of the belting for the underlap of the closing.</p>
  <p>All pleats will remain on the straight thread of material on the <strong>outer</strong> edge
    of the pleat. All over-lapping will be made on the wrong side of the pleat.
    The hip pleats should have the greatest over-lap as there is more curve at
    the hip.</p>
  <p>After the hip line and waist line are adjusted to size, catch a tape across
    the hip line on the wrong side at four inches below the waist line, catching
    the back edge of the pleat. This tape will remain on the skirt to hold the
    pleats in place. There should also be a tape around the hip line. The tape
    is tacked on one edge only to the under-fold of the pleat.</p>
  <p>If desired, the pleats can then be stitched from the waist to the hip line,
    stitching close to the outer edge from the right side of the skirt. Apply
    the belt as for skirts.</p>
  <p>Middy skirts attached to a waist lining can be made of straight pleating
    without fitting in at the waist line. The skirt is hemmed and pleated as
    directed and hung from the hem upward.</p>
  <p>Practice each lesson by making pleats in crepe paper. The lesson will be
    quickly learned and will be interesting.</p>

  <h3>    <b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="hanging" id="hanging"></a></font></b>HANGING SKIRTS</h3>
  <p>    Hem requisites Skirts should be hung equidistant from the floor unless
        otherwise designed; all pleats should be flat and should hang on an even
        line at the
      lower edge. The hem should not be too wide; the stitches should be invisible
      and should be handmade. The hem should be pressed to a knife edge at the
  lower edge but should not be pressed through to the right side of the goods.</p>
  <p>Baste in a test hem when making a dress. One can easily determine the desired
    length of the skirt if a hem is basted. The uniform length all around the
    skirt should then be found before making the hem.</p>
  <p>Hems on skirts should, as a rule, be not wider than two and a half or three
    inches, finished. A two-inch hem is even easier to handle, and if the skirt
    is circular or cut with a decided flare, a two-inch hem will be too wide.
    In such a case a narrow rolled hem is often the best to use, especially on
    thin materials.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/04_wide-hems.jpg" alt="fabric with deep hem folded" width="132" height="156" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Wide hems</h4>
  <p>Wide hems can be made in children's dresses to allow for &quot;let out&quot;.
    This wide hem allowance can be folded under the first turning, thus making
    the hem appear much narrower. The skirt can then be let down the width of
    the hem. This will make a hem of three thicknesses rather than two, but is
    advisable when a &quot;let-out&quot; is desired.</p>
  <h4>    Fit hips </h4>
  <p>The skirt should be belted before it is hung. A tight belt will shorten
    the skirt in the back as it will pull the skirt over the curve of the back
    at the waist. The hip line should also be fitted and the same shoes should
    be worn as will be worn when wearing the dress; different heels will alter
    the length of the skirt. Stand firmly on both feet, a slouching posture cannot
    produce a straight hem.</p>
  <p>    Sagging Circular or semi-circular skirts made of loosely woven materials
      will sag on the bias sections. Different materials will sag more or less
      according to the material used. Circular skirts should hang for several
      hours or even days to permit the weight of the material to sag down the
      necessary amount.</p>
  <p>If the dress is to be finished quickly, it is advisable to press the material
    on the wrong side, drawing down on the bias sections as it is pressed. This
    will draw out the material the same amount that it will eventually sag when
    it is worn for some time.</p>
  <p>    Trial hem A trial hem should be basted into the skirt before the first fitting.
      The skirt can be hung, even if the skirt is basted up too short.</p>
  <p>If the hem is basted too short or if a hem is to be lengthened, hang the
    whole skirt one inch shorter than desired. After the skirt is removed these
    pins are chalk marked for placement and the hem is then marked one inch lower.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/04_cross-pins.jpg" alt="pins placed vertically and horizontally, forming a &quot;plus&quot; sign" width="132" height="146" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Cross-pins</h4>
  <p> If there are only one or two short places in the skirt, hang the skirt
    the correct length on all the rest of the skirt and at the short places,
    place
    cross-pins. This will indicate that the skirt must be lengthened one inch
    at these pins.</p>
  <p>Cross-pins are also used to denote some important alteration. Pull the pin
    into the goods up to the head so that it will not slip out. Place cross-pins
    for buttons, for loops, for slashed openings, for pocket placement, etc.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/04_ruler.jpg" alt="L-shaped ruler with rubber band marking length along longer leg" width="113" height="170" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Use a ruler
or square</h4>
  <p> A tailor's square is the most satisfactory tool for marking hems on customers.
    The short arm of the square rests on the floor and the long arm stands upright
  loosely in the hand that holds the skirt. A yardstick may also be used.</p>
  <p>A ruler can also be used, but is not as convenient. A rubber band placed
    at the correct length on the square or the ruler is an advantage if the eyesight
    is poor.</p>
  <p>    Pins or chalk Marking can be made with pins or with tailor's chalk. The latter
      is quicker to use, but any changes must be rubbed off immediately or they
      will be confusing later. Pins, when placed horizontally, make a splendid
      indication of the length to be seen in the mirror.</p>
  <p>After the length has been found, turn up a portion of the front of the skirt
    as a trial so that the customer can see the length she has selected. If she
    is particular it may be well to pin up the hem all around as many judge the
    length by the back of the skirt rather than the front.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/04_circular.jpg" alt="hem of circular skirt marked with pins" width="132" height="164" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Circular skirts</h4>
<p>When hanging circular skirts, permit the skirt to hang in pleats at the
    lower edge and place a pin for the lower edge mark through the complete fold.
    The fold is then press marked as directed for hems in pleats and is trimmed
    off later when lying flat on the table. The curve can then be evened.</p>
  <p>If the skirt is trimmed off on the customer, the row of pins should be placed
    first, then the trimming should be at least one-half inch below the pins
    if the hem is to be rolled. It is not advisable to trim off a hem on the
    customer, as it is difficult to secure a straight line later. The heckled
    edge must be again trimmed, and this may make the skirt too short.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/04_hems-pleats.jpg" alt="pleats marked for hemming" width="132" height="157" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Hems in pleats</h4>
  <p>All hems in pleats should be marked with the pleats <strong>basted shut</strong> and then
    press-marked under at the turning. This will make the back edge of the pleat
    a trifle shorter than the front edge and it will never drop down at the back.
    The finished skirt should fit perfectly with the pleats basted shut, basting
    to the raw edge of the skirt before hanging. Do not depend on open pleats
    for loose fitting.</p>
  <h4>    Seams open </h4>
  <p>All joining seams inside the hems of pleats should be pressed open before
    turning. When the hem is basted up the seams should lie flat against each
    other; clip the seam just above the top of the hem.</p>
  <p>    Pleated skirts Hems on solid pleating, such as middy skirts, should be made
      on the straight thread of material and be made complete before the skirt
      is fitted, fitting from the hem upward.</p>
  <p>The lower edge of all stripes and plaids should be as straight as possible
    with the thread of the goods, so as to follow the line of the stripe. This
    may require additional darts in the back of the skirt at the waist line.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/04_hanging.jpg" alt="using a conveniently hip-height table edge to mark evenly around hips on dress being worn" width="110" height="201" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Hanging a skirt
on one's self</h4>
  <p> It is seldom possible to cut a dress or skirt to the exact length without
    a guide for individual cutting. The posture of the figure influences the
    hanging of the skirt, and it is therefore necessary to hang each skirt on
    the individual.</p>
  <p>A skirt cannot be marked correctly by laying it flat on a table. Every material
    sags to a different degree and this will make the hem uneven in places even
    though the pattern has been followed perfectly.</p>
  <p>The skirt must be suspended to secure the correct length. The best plan
    is to put the dress on and hang it to the desired length.</p>
  <p>The previous lesson dealt with hanging skirts on a customer, while this
    lesson deals with hanging a skirt on one's self. It is not difficult if the
    following method is used:</p>
  <p>Any length marked on the skirt will give an even hanging if it is marked
    <strong>below</strong> the curve of the hip line. A table is a convenient height to use as
    a guide; a yardstick can be used if so desired.</p>
  <p>Stand close to a table for marking. Be sure the height of the table is below
    the curve of the hip line. Mark with tailor's chalk or a row of pins.</p>
  <p>As you stand close to the table, place a pin in the skirt at the height
    of the table. Turn and place another pin four inches from the first pin and
    continue all around the skirt, placing the pins or marking the chalk marks
    about four inches apart.</p>
  <h4>    Mark the back </h4>
  <p>At the back, pick up the skirt at the table height and bring it to the front,
    so as to place a pin in it. A chalk mark can be made in the same manner.
    This will make a line equidistant from the floor.</p>
  <p>    Pin up a hem Before removing the skirt, reach down and pin under a trial
      hem to be sure that the skirt is the desired length.</p>
  <p>Also note if there is a short place cut in the skirt which may make it necessary
    to make it even shorter than desired.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/04_coat-hanger.jpg" alt="skirt hanging by waist from coat hanger" width="132" height="152" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Use a coat
hanger</h4>
  <p> Remove the dress and select a coat hanger with a cross bar. Slide the waist
    of the dress through the hanger above the bar. Do not place the hanger in
    the shoulders of the dress. The skirt or the dress must be hung over the
    bar at
    the waist line, and be pinned to the bar along the waist line to insure a
    straight line for marking. The dress will then be hanging as though it had
    been held
  up by the waist line with the waist dropping to the back of the dress.</p>
  <p>If the hook of the coat hanger is turned, it can be hooked over the top
    of an open door and the lower edge of the skirt will be at a convenient height
    to mark.</p>
  <h4>    Measure the
desired length</h4>
  <p>Measure the height of the table and this will give the number of inches
    from the floor that the mark on the skirt was made. If the skirt is to be
    ten inches from the floor, then subtract ten inches from the table height
    as represented by the marks on the dress. Measure the desired length down
    from the marks on the skirt. If the table is thirty inches high and the skirt
    is to be ten inches from the floor, measure twenty inches down from each
    pin to secure the desired skirt length at each pin.</p>
  <h4>    Circular skirts </h4>
  <p>If the skirt is quite circular, it is advisable to place a ruler across
    the lower edge of the skirt after several marks have been made and chalk-mark
    across the fullness, gradually shifting the fullness until the lower edge
    is marked correctly.</p>

  <h3 class="clear">    <b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="hems" id="hems"></a></font></b>HEMS</h3>
  <h4>    <img src="images/04_mark-edge.jpg" alt="skirt with bottom edge marked" width="67" height="174" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Mark the edge</h4>
  <p>Mark the lower edge of the skirt as directed in hanging skirts. Remove the
    dress and place it on the press board wrong side up. Press up the hem on
    this mark, making the crease even from mark to mark. This crease will test
    any possible mistakes in marking and will insure a perfect turning. This
    final crease marking applies to all skirts whether the hem is wide or narrow.
    It will be crease-marked before it is trimmed off.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    Press out
fullness</h4>
  <p> <img src="images/04_press-out.jpg" alt="full hem on skirt turned up, with arrows pointing to fullness in hem which must be pressed out" width="132" height="154" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />When a skirt is quite circular it is sometimes advisable to run a gathering
    thread along the top of the hem to draw out the fullness, but in most materials
  a satisfactory result can be attained by pressing.</p>
  <p>After the hem has been crease-marked, baste it on to the skirt at a quarter
    inch from the bottom of the skirt. After this has been done, place the skirt
    on the press board wrong side up and press out the fullness, pressing from
    the lower edge of the hem to the top. It may be necessary to use moisture
    as directed in the rules for pressing. Continue pressing until all the fullness
    disappears. Wool will shrink to shape more readily than any other material,
    but this fullness can be pressed out of practically all curved hems.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/04_trim-off.jpg" alt="hem, turned, with fullness pressed out, and uneven edge being trimmed off" width="132" height="160" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Trim off</h4>
  <p> After the fullness has been pressed out of the hem, it should be trimmed
    off to an even width. Check the general width to find the narrowest place
    in the
    hem, and if this place is not more than three inches wide, all the hem should
  be marked to this width.</p>
  <p>Notch a card at the desired width for the hem; a button card or a snap fastener
    card is especially good. After the hem has been trimmed off, it is ready
    for hemming.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    Turn under
the edge</h4>
  <p> Some dressmakers prefer to turn<img src="images/04_turn-under-b.jpg" alt="basting board being used  to baste hem flat" width="132" height="162" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /> under <img src="images/04_turn-under-a.jpg" alt="trimmed edge of hem being turned under" width="128" height="173" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />the raw edge of the hem and either
    run it down by machine an eighth of an inch from the edge or make a running
    stitch through it. This will be done before the hem is basted to the skirt.
    It will then be pressed before applying. The hem is then ready for basting
    to the skirt with the skirt wrong side up. Slide the press board into the
    skirt and under the portion of the hem to be basted. The hem can then be
    properly arranged, the seams matched, and it can be pinned and basted <strong>flat</strong>.</p>
  <p><strong>All wide hems should be basted flat.</strong> It is very unsatisfactory to baste
    hems in the hands. The hem stitches are made in the hand, but the hem should
    be basted to the skirt with the skirt flat on the table wrong side out and
    the basting board or magazine slid into the skirt under the hem.</p>
  <h4>    Press seams
open </h4>
  <p>Press open all seams of the skirt that will be under the hem; especially
    is this important in pleats. Make these seams match as the hem is basted.
    Never stretch the hem across the seam, for it will twist when finished. A
    twisted seam cannot be straightened in pressing.</p>
  <h4 class="clear"><img src="images/04_heavy-hems.jpg" alt="binding applied to top edge of hem" width="132" height="131" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Heavy hems are
    finished with
ribbon binding</h4>
  <p>Heavy material is not turned under at the edge of the hem. The edge is finished
    with ribbon seam-binding or a commercial bias binding, before it is caught
    to the dress. (See <a href="hsc-3.html#bias">lesson on binding</a>.) The ribbon binding should be basted
    to a curved hem <strong>after</strong> the hem is pressed up and the fullness is pressed out.
    The ribbon is basted to the raw edge of the hem with the ribbon flat. The
    basting board is slipped under the hem for the basting between the hem and
    the skirt. If this method is not used, the ribbon will either be ruffled
    or the hem will ruffle. The few minutes extra time spent in making the hem
    perfect is well worth the effort in the neatness of the finished garment.</p>
  <h4>    Wide machine
    hems are
seldom used</h4>
  <p>There are various widths of sewing machine attachments for hems, but they
    are used for narrow hems and are excellent to use when hemming long lengths
    of material. Wide hems should be turned by hand, basted, and then either
    stitched on the sewing machine or by hand. Very few dress hems are made on
    the sewing machine, even in better made cotton house dresses. If the hem
    is to be machine made, be sure to lay it flat on the table and pin it at
    the seams before basting. If the seams do not overlap perfectly the seam
    will twist when finished.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/04_creasing-hems.jpg" alt="accordion-pleated hem" width="132" height="91" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Creasing hems
by folding</h4>
  <p>Material, such as gingham, that holds a crease can be creased in the hands.
    Turn the first turn of the hem by creasing with the fingers and folding the
    edge up in the fingers as the creasing progresses, similar to making a set
    of accordion pleats about an inch wide.</p>
  <h4>    Rolled hems
without sewing</h4>
  <p>Organdy hems can be rolled between the thumb and finger, especially on the
    bias, and will remain rolled without sewing but will not be washable. Dampen
    the fingers with the lips and roll up the edge, rolling about an inch at
    a time. Practice will make perfect. This is especially useful in making flowers
    and ruffles.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/04_machine-stitch.jpg" alt="narrow, machine-stitched hem" width="132" height="161" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Machine stitch
narrow hems</h4>
  <p>Hand-sewed narrow hems should be machine-stitched close to the raw edge
    before turning&#8212;about one-eighth of an inch. As the hem is rolled under
    with the point of the needle it is slip-stitched to the skirt. Trim off the
    rough threads as the hemming progresses. One end of the hem can be pinned
    to the basting board and the hem can be made very quickly and much narrower
    than can be turned without the stitching. The stitching also prevents the
    skirt from rippling on the hem.</p>
  <h4 class="clear"><img src="images/04_faced-hems.jpg" alt="reverse view of faced hem, showing seams along facing" width="132" height="141" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Faced hems</h4>
  <p> Faced hems are made differently. The facing must be cut on the same thread
    of material as the hem or a true bias. The former is preferable. The facing
    may be made in several pieces, but all the joining seams should be made on
    a lengthwise thread of the material never on a bias. The seam must then be
    pressed open. The facing is basted to the skirt after it is trimmed off even
    at the lower edge. The facing is held a trifle tighter than the dress so
    that it will roll back when turned.</p>
  <p>After the facing is stitched to the skirt, press open the seam and trim
    it off to an eighth inch on the hem side. The facing is then turned back,
    sliding the basting board into the skirt and under the hem for the basting.
    Draw the facing back from the edge an eighth inch. Baste the hem at the lower
    edge along the seam line.</p>
  <p>This will make the joining seam invisible. After the facing is pressed back,
    join the two unfinished edges and slip-stitch one to the other. (See right
    side basting.) Stitch the seam and press open. Turn under the top edge and
    finish with a tailor's slip stitch.</p>
  <h4>    Velvet hems
    finished with
ribbon</h4>
  <p>Velvet weaves and heavy materials such as broadcloth and heavy coatings
    should be bound with ribbon seam binding before hemming.</p>

  <h4><img src="images/04_invisible.jpg" alt="hem being made with invisible stitch" width="132" height="132" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Invisible stitch
    on both right
and wrong side</h4>
  <p> The tailor's slip stitch is used for hems, facings, coat linings and any
    invisible sewing.</p>
  <p>This is an invisible stitch with no threads visible on either the wrong
    or the right side of the goods, if made correctly. Prepare the lower edge
    as directed; trim off; turn under the edge, and baste the hem as it lies
    flat on the basting board, basting one-quarter inch from the edge. Lift the
    skirt and turn the hem <strong>back</strong> from the eye, making a fold of the skirt at the
    top of the hem with the hem dropping to the back.</p>
  <p>The top of the hem now protrudes a quarter inch above the fold just made.
    Catch a thread on the skirt and in the same operation slide the needle into
    the fold of the <strong>hem</strong> and draw out the thread; again catch a thread of the
    skirt and in the same operation slide the needle into the fold of the hem.
    Continue to the end of the hem.</p>
  <h4>    Make stitches
loose</h4>
  <p> When the hem is turned back, all the stitches are invisible and if only
    a thread or two of the skirt has been caught into the needle, there will
    be no stitches
    visible on the right side. The looser the stitches the more invisible they
    will be. This is especially important to remember when hemming coats or heavy
  skirts.</p>
  <p>When making a tailored hem, it is possible to take long stitches, much longer
    than can be made with any other kind of a stitch. For this reason a hem can
    be made very quickly.</p>
  <p>When using this stitch for coat linings, the stitches must be very close
    together.</p>
  <p>Practice all hems on materials.</p>

  <h3 class="clear">    <b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="belts" id="belts"></a></font></b>BELTS</h3>
  <h4><img src="images/04_perfect-belts.jpg" alt="belt being cut from lengthwise edge of fabric" width="132" height="183" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Perfect belts</h4>
  <p> It is quite important to make the belt correctly. It must be cut right,
    made right and pressed right to secure a perfect effect.</p>
  <p>Belts should always be cut on the <strong>lengthwise</strong> thread of material and not
    on the crosswise. This is a common error. A <strong>crosswise</strong> cut belt will twist,
    but the lengthwise will always remain flat. If there is not sufficient length
    to make the belt on the lengthwise, it is advisable to piece it rather than
    make it on the crosswise. A belt of sheer material should be lined, either
    with the same material or a plain color matching the background if the material
    is figured.</p>
  <h4>    Plan the belt </h4>
  <p>Plan to cut the belt when laying out the dress; it should be cut or torn
    down the edge of the selvage. A torn belt will assure an even width, which
    is quite essential. If it is not torn, be sure to measure the width and crease
    the line for cutting, as an uneven belt is very noticeable.</p>
  <p>    Pin edges The belt will twist, even when cut correctly, if the edges are
      not pinned and matched on the thread of the goods before stitching. Pin
      the edges as they lie flat on the table; then baste or stitch.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/04_press-open.jpg" alt="seam pressed open" width="119" height="151" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Press open
the seam</h4>
  <p> This is one of the tricks of making perfect belts. <strong>Press open the
      seam after sides of the belt are joined and before it is turned.</strong> This can be accomplished
    by first pressing back one side of the seam, then placing the seam down the
  center of the belt and pressing it.</p>
  <p>The end of the belt is then stitched, either with the belt seam down the
    center or at one side. After the end is stitched the belt is turned.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/04_turn-belt.jpg" alt="safety pin being used to turn sewn belt  rightside out" width="132" height="94" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Turn the belt</h4>
  <p>To turn the belt, clip open a few stitches three inches from the finished
    point. Open the seam for an inch or more, hook a safety pin to one side of
    the seam and push the safety pin through the belt. Push out the point with
    a pencil or closed scissors. Press the finished belt according to the rules
    for pressing. Moisture must be used to make it lie flat with keen edges.</p>
  <h4 class="clear"><img src="images/04_stitched-belt-a.jpg" alt="tailor's canvas basted to belt; belt folded and sewn " width="132" height="152" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Stitched belts</h4>
  <p>  Belts on tailored garments are often filled with several rows of machine stitching.
    It is important to cut this belt of even width, as any variation in the width
    will be more evident when the belt is stitched.</p>
  <p>This type of belt requires an extra reinforcement. If the belt is cut double,
    reinforce one side only. In this case, there will be but one seam allowed
    on the reinforcement.</p>
  <p>Cut the material from pre-shrunk, unbleached muslin or thin tailor's canvas,
    cutting it on a true bias. Allow but one seam if the belt is cut double.
    After the belt has been pressed double to secure an edge line, baste this
    strip to this creased edge with matching thread; the thread will not be removed.
    This basting holds it in place when the belt is turned.</p>
  <p>Pin the belt together and baste the three edges of goods down the side,
    the two edges of the belt and the one edge of the muslin. After it is stitched,
    trim off the seam as close as possible to the stitching. Turn and press.</p>
  <p>Chalk-mark the lines for the machine stitching, as many rows as are desired.
    They are usually made about a quarter-inch apart. The belt will be filled
    completely with the stitching. Press when finished.</p>
  <p class="clear"><img src="images/04_stitched-belt-b.jpg" alt="belt with circular buckle; belt with link buckle" width="132" height="137" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />The buckle for a lapped belt will be placed on the left side of the belt,
    lapping it from the right to the left as in the rules for closing women's
    garments. If the buckle has a tongue, it must be pushed through the material
    and the end sewed over the buckle. Slide buckles will be sewed to the left
    side of the belt. The ends should extend at least two inches beyond the buckle
    when fastened. A longer tab must be fastened with a snap.</p>
  <p>Link buckles must be carefully measured with the belt. Sew one side of the
    link to the belt and try it on. Slide the other end through the link and
    measure the exact size before cutting.</p>
  <h4>    Eyelets </h4>
  <p>Eyelets for the belt tongue can be made by hand or machine. For the hand-made
    eyelets, punch the hole with a stiletto or a nut pick, making the hole the
    size of the tongue of the buckle.</p>
  <p>The hole is then worked with buttonhole twist either with over-casting with
    close stitches or with a buttonhole stitch.</p>
  <h4>    Metal eyelets </h4>
  <p>Metal eyelets can be set into the belt by a machine at a novelty shop where
    pleating and buttons are made. Three or four eyelets are usually sufficient.
    This gives the belt a tailored effect. These same eyelets can be set into
    the waist or yoke of the dress for lacings.</p>
  <h4>    Buckles made </h4>
  <p>Buckles can be covered with material either by the button maker or by hand.
    Cut a piece of material one inch larger than the buckle. Cover the piece
    with fabric patching paste and place it over the buckle with the corners
    on the bias portion, or the greatest curve on curved buckle. Stretch the
    material over the buckle, stretching as smooth as possible at the corners,
    pulling out the fullness on the bias. Trim off the surplus material after
    it is dry, as the inside of the buckle will be covered with a separate piece.
    Stitches taken across the inside of the buckle will assist in holding the
    material in place. Cut a scrap the exact size of the buckle and paste to
    the inside after the surplus goods is removed; catch to the material at the
    edges.</p>
  <h4>    Attach belts </h4>
  <p>It is advisable to attach the belt to the dress so that it is always in
    place. Attach at each under-arm seam and at the center back. If the belt
    is not tacked to the dress in the back, it will slide to the front when the
    dress is put on and the dress must be removed to change it. Belts with the
    seam on the edge will be attached with the seam at the lower edge of the
    belt.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/04_bar-tacks.jpg" alt="ached to belt" width="132" height="159" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Bar tacks</h4>
  <p>The modern method of attaching belts is with bar tacks. This eliminates
    the loops at the sides and will give a loose appearance to the belt. Pin
    to place; fold the belt back over the finger at the seam, with the center
    of the belt at the waist line. Take several stitches from the belt to the
    side seam, holding the belt away from the seam a quarter of an inch. After
    several stitches have been taken, wind the thread around the stitches with
    the head of the needle and tack. It is not necessary to buttonhole around
    the thread.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/04_thread-loops.jpg" alt="thread loop from above waist seam to below waist seam" width="82" height="151" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Thread
loops wound</h4>
  <p>If a thread loop is desired at the side seam, it will be made with buttonhole
    twist. Take a small stitch on the right side of the dress, after bringing
    the thread from the wrong side to conceal the knot. Start the thread half
    the width of the belt above the waist line, take the second stitch below
    the waist line at half the width of the belt. Repeat this stitch until there
    are at least four threads, then with the head of the needle wind the thread
    around and around these threads. Tack at the bottom with several stitches.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/04_thread-loops-crocheted.jpg" alt="hand position showing how to pull thread through loop to form crocheted belt loop" width="132" height="164" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Thread loops
crocheted</h4>
  <p>Thread loops can also be crocheted with a crochet hook or with the fingers.
    Start the loop with the needle to tack the thread to place. Take one stitch
    for the first loop of thread, reach through this loop and draw out the thread
    into another loop and continue till a long strand is crocheted. At the end
    pull the thread through the last loop to knot it and then thread the needle
    and tack the thread to the dress.</p>
  <h4>    Tailored loops </h4>
  <p>Material can be stitched into a tailored loop (see <a href="hsc-3.html#tailored">lesson
      on loops</a>), and
    used for a belt slot. In this case the loop is prepared and is stitched into
    the side seam above and below the waist line when the dress is made. This
    is often found in ready-made dresses.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">Belting</h4>
  <p> Skirt belting is used only to sty the <img src="images/04_belting-b.jpg" alt="belting material stitched to waist and turned back" width="132" height="113" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />waist <img src="images/04_belting.jpg" alt="belting fabric being applied to waist edge of skirt" width="132" height="143" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />line of a skirt. If the material
    is heavy, which is usually the case in separate skirts, seam binding, either
    silk or cotton, should also be used to reduce the bulk of the seam.</p>
  <p>Baste the waist line of the skirt over the belting with the belting extending
    at the top of the skirt. It is not turned back until later. Allow for the
    width of the seam; and match the belting to this line which will be the top
    of the skirt when the belting is turned back.</p>
  <p>Be sure to measure the exact size of the waist and pin the belting to the
    skirt at this size, measuring from the finished edge of the front to the
    seam line of the placket in the back. The extra length of belting extending
    under the placket at the back must be allowed. Place the skirt on to the
    belting and baste or pin to place; then cover the seam with seam binding
    pinned to place. As it is difficult to baste belting, it may be machine-stitched
    to place without basting if a sufficient number of pins are used to hold
    it in place. Both edges of the binding will be flat-stitched to the belting.</p>
  <p>After the skirt is stitched to the belting, it is turned back at the top
    and basted flat, then machine-stitched one-quarter inch from the edge of
    the waist line. Hooks and eyes are placed after the top is finished and are
    slid into the binding and sewed back before the belting is tacked to the
    edge of the seam.</p>

  <h3>    <b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="plackets" id="plackets"></a></font></b>PLACKETS</h3>
  <h4>    Where made </h4>
  <p>Plackets are skirt or dress openings made at the side seam at the left of
    the skirt. The dress placket extends five inches into the side seam on the
    waist and down five to seven inches on the side seam of the skirt. This opening
    will permit the closely fitted waist to be slipped over the body when the
    garment is put on. If the waist of a dress is made loose or the waist line
    is quite large, it will not be necessary to make a placket. The figure with
    a very small waist requires a longer placket than the figure with a large
    waist line.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">How lapped<img src="images/04_lapped-b.jpg" alt="side and bottom view of sleeve, showing wrist placket" width="132" height="180" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />    on<img src="images/04_lapped-a.jpg" alt="side view of bodice joined to skirt, with side placket marked" width="126" height="172" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /> skirt</h4>
  <p> The placket overlaps the back with the front edge turned under. It is closed
    flush with the seam and with the back edge extending under the seam. It is
    closed with snaps. If the waist is fitted quite close, there should be a
    hook and eye at the waist line.</p>
  <p>There are several kinds of slashed openings on necks and sleeves but they
    are not termed plackets. An opening at the seam of the sleeve may be finished
    according to the rules for plackets, and a slashed opening either in the
    sleeve or at the neck might be finished with a continuous placket finish.</p>
  <p>A slashed opening on the back edge of a sleeve laps from the front to the
    back. If the opening is on the seam of the sleeve which is inside of the
    arm, it will also lap from the front to the back but on the other side of
    the sleeve. Both openings should lap to the back so that the wearer cannot
    look into the gap.</p>
  <h4>    Types of
plackets</h4>
  <p>There are several methods of making plackets but only three are used in
    practical dressmaking. Others may be used in tailoring but are quite intricate.
    The continuous placket is used on all material that is not heavy. As the
    material is doubled it will be too heavy when used on heavy materials. Heavy
    materials can either be finished with a faced and bound placket or with extended
    seams.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/04_mark-sewing.jpg" alt="inside view of side seam" width="128" height="176" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Mark the
sewing line</h4>
  <p> All plackets, however made, should be made on the sewing line of the garment.
    For this reason, the sewing line must be marked. It is advisable to baste
    the side seam to the top and press the seam open at the placket line to make
    a
  crease on both sides of the seam. This line must be followed.</p>
  <p>All placket material should be cut on the lengthwise thread of the material.
    Crosswise or bias material will not lie flat, and will produce a bulging
    effect that is not produced with the lengthwise. The placket edge must not
    be stretched; both sides must match. This makes it advisable to pin the placket
    strip to the opening before it is stitched and then measured to determine
    the matching length. Plackets on dresses should be finished narrow, about
    one-half inch wide, and usually with a continuous placket, as the stitches
    must not show on the right side. If the placket is made too wide, it will
    draw on the seam at the waistline when turned back.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/04_continuous-placket.jpg" alt="side seam clipped at hip line" width="56" height="158" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Continuous
    placket seam
clipped</h4>
  <p>Continuous binding for the placket is the most popular, as it is easily
    and quickly made and is finished either by machine or by hands. Cut a strip
    of the goods of silk or cotton an inch and a half wide with a selvage on
    one side. The selvage makes a strong edge. When basting on the finish, hold
    the skirt on top and the finish strip underneath. It will not stretch as
    easily when basted in this manner. The seam at the hip must also be clipped
    into the sewing line so that the placket opening can be stretched into an
    opened line as the finish is applied. Trim back the sewing line to within
    a quarter of an inch of the crease, which should have been made when the
    seam was pressed back to mark the placket.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/04_finished.jpg" alt="side placket with machine stitching" width="119" height="178" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Finished by
machine</h4>
  <p>For the machine finished placket the dress is held <strong>right side</strong> out, the finish
    strip is pinned <strong>under</strong> the dress or skirt at the top on the back portion,
    the seam will be on the right side. Pin the full length, place a pin EXACTLY
    at the sewing line where the stitching ends at the bottom. (This is important.)
    Straighten the placket out and pin the finish to the front side. After it
    is pinned to place, measure to see that both edges are <strong>exactly</strong> the same length
    before stitching. This may prevent ripping later. Baste and stitch, following
    the sewing lines on the dress and be sure to stitch to the <strong>point</strong> and not
    curve off at the end of the seam. The placket is then pinned, and basted
    over the seam, completely covering the first stitching. Watch the bottom.
    Be sure not to twist the material when stitching. The finish should be straight
    and flat.</p>
  <p>    Hand finished Follow the same method as explained in machine-finished plackets
      but turn the dress to the wrong side rather than the right side. This will
      make the first seam on the wrong side of the garment rather than on the
      right side as it is made. In the machine finish. The final finish will
      be made on the wrong side, while the machine finish is on the right side.</p>
  <p>Cut the material on the lengthwise thread and baste it on by the same method,
    starting at the top and pinning to the bottom to the clipped seam and up
    the front edge. Test to determine if both edges match. Stitch and then finish
    by hand with a slip-stitch.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/04_pressed.jpg" alt="side placket finished and pressed" width="132" height="164" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Pressed</h4>
  <p>Turn the dress to the wrong side for both types of plackets. Baste or pin
    the two top edges of the finish together while the binding is open; then
    machine-stitch across them twice. Trim off. The front edge will then be pressed
    <strong>under</strong> the front, and the back edge will extend. The snaps can be sewed to
    the finish without the stitches being visible.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    Faced and
bound</h4>
  <p> <img src="images/04_faced-bound.jpg" alt="waist placket bound" width="132" height="156" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />This finish is used on heavier materials, and is made with two short strips
    rather than with one long strip. The front strip is cut one and a half inches
    wide and the back two and a half inches wide. They are both made a half-inch
    longer than the opening. This placket will be finished on the wrong side,
    and will also be cut on the lengthwise thread of material.</p>
  <p>Baste with the dress right side out and with the placket held on top. Pin
    to position, measure to determine if both edges match in length; baste on
    the seeing line of the garment. Machine-stitch; <strong>press the seam open</strong> before
    turning back. Baste back the front edge and press. If the material is not
    too heavy, turn under the outer edge and slip-stitch to the garment on the
    front. On the back section the finish will be folded double and slip-stitched
    to the seam. The front finish folds under; the back edge extends. Overlap
    the edges on the right side and pin together. Turn the skirt to the wrong
    side and press. Machine-stitch the two placket strips together at the bottom,
    or catch the back piece to the front piece. Be sure that the top of the front
    is the correct length when turned back.</p>

  <p> This placket is used on heavy skirt material and must be cut into the dress.
    An extra inch must be allowed on the seam at the left side of the skirt on
    both the back and front; especially on the back; the front can be finished
    back with seam binding if necessary. If the extra allowance is not made,
    a single strip of material can be stitched to the back edge and the seam
    pressed open. One thickness of goods is used; the edge is pinked.</p>
  <p>The sewing line must be marked at the placket line, the seam can be basted
    together and pressed open to secure this line. The bastings can then be removed
    and the perfect line is made to follow for the placket.</p>
  <p>Turn the skirt to the wrong side, hand sew a length of ribbon seam binding
    next to the crease on the placket side on both the back and front edges.
    This ribbon will keep the material from stretching and will make a stay for
    the snaps.</p>
  <p>Baste back the edge of the placket on the front side and catch with a few
    stitches. Attach the front and back lower edges of the placket together.
    Set the snaps and press. If the material frays, bind the edges with silk
    seam binding.</p>
  <h4>    Slashed
openings</h4>
  <p> Slashed openings are often bound with the slash straightened out, stitching
    the binding with a narrow seam which gradually diminishes to the point on
    the dress side only. The binding seam remains the same width. Baste with
    the dress
    side out and with seam line visible. The slash is opened into a straight
    line for the first stitching. The binding is finished down with a slip-stitch.
    A
    slashed opening on a neck or sleeve will be faced if small loops are used
    for fastening. (See bias binding.)</p>
  <p>Make sample plackets of crepe paper.</p>

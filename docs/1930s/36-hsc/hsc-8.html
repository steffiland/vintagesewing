  <h3><em><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="back" id="back"></a></font></strong></em>The Back</h3>
  <h4>Back of waist </h4>
  <p>Fitting the dress in the back above the armpits is the most important part
    of fitting and is usually completely ignored. The comfort of the dress depends
    upon the perfect fitting of this section, as the depths and widths vary greatly
    for each individual figure and if not fitted correctly will affect the fitting
    of the front, sleeves and even the hanging of the skirt. Therefore, carefully
    study the problems of the back for it may be that therein lies the trouble.</p>
  <ol>
    <img src="images/08_pouch-upper.jpg" alt="bodice back" width="132" height="146" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />    
    <li><strong><a name="back1" id="back1"></a></strong>  Pouch across the upper back</li>
  </ol>
  <p> Cause: This pouch often occurs in a dress with a fitted sleeve when
      the figure is short from the armpit to the shoulders and neck. Over-erect
      figures and
    those with square shoulders have this difficulty.</p>
  <p>Correction: If the dress has been sewed together, rip out the top of the
    sleeve and the shoulder seam and raise the back section of the dress until
    the back rests well up to the pit of the arm. Pin the shoulder seam at the
    altered line. (See &quot;sleeve alteration.&quot;)</p>
  <ol start="2">
    <li class="clear"><img src="images/08_pouch-back.jpg" alt="bodice and skirt" width="132" height="181" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /> <strong><a name="back2" id="back2"></a></strong>Pouch in the back at the waist line</li>
  </ol>
  <p> Cause: This fullness appears on &quot;sway back&quot; figures and is caused
    by there being too much material in length of the waist at the center back.</p>
  <p>Correction: If the waist is cut in one piece with the back of the waist,
    a crosswise dart can be taken at the waist line sufficiently deep in the
    center back to eliminate the fullness, diminishing to nothing at the side
    seams.</p>
  <p>If the dress has a seam at the waist, the skirt can be lifted at the center
    back.</p>
  <p>If the waist line is not desired, vertical tucks can be made on each side
    equidistant from the center back.</p>
  <ol start="3">
    <li class="clear">  <strong><a name="back3" id="back3"></a></strong><img src="images/08_pouch-underarm.jpg" alt="bodice and skirt" width="132" height="161" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Pouch at the underarm seam through the back</li>
  </ol>
  <p> Cause: This will be found on short-waisted figures when the underarm
      seam is too long.</p>
  <p>Correction: This could be altered in the pattern if the garment has not
    been cut, but if the garment has been made, the alteration must be made at
    the waist line by lifting the skirt to shorten the waist.</p>
  <ol start="4">
    <li class="clear"> <strong><a name="back4" id="back4"></a></strong><img src="images/08_fullness-armhole.jpg" alt="bodice" width="132" height="188" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Fullness at the armhole in the back</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Cause: This may be caused by&#8212;</p>
  <ol>
    <li>  Round or stooped shoulders.</li>
    <li> The pattern being too long in the scye depth, or the space between
      the armpit and the neck.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Correction: For round or stooped shoulders, raise the back shoulder seam
    sufficiently to lift out the pouch. It may then be necessary to add tucks
    at the back of the neck to eliminate the fullness that may appear at the
    center back. If tucks are not desired, this extra fullness can be eliminated
    by making the shoulder seam slightly sloping toward the armhole.</p>
  <p>If the pattern was too long, the dress has been cut too low at the underarm
    and must be raised at the armpit so as to rest against the arm. Raise the
    whole back section if necessary. (See No. 1&#8212;pouch across upper back.)</p>
  <ol start="5">
    <li class="clear"> <strong><a name="back5" id="back5"></a></strong><img src="images/08_low-armhole.jpg" alt="bodice and sleeve" width="132" height="174" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Armhole too low</li>
  </ol>
  <p> Cause: The armhole is often cut too deep in the back for comfort when
      the dress has a fitted sleeve. This does not apply to the Dolman type sleeve.</p>
  <p>The armhole should rest well up to the pit of the arm. The top of the underarm
    seam could be measured with a ruler placed across at the armpit. The top
    of the material should be even with the top of the ruler. Make this measurement
    one-half inch shorter for the underarm seams.</p>
  <p>&quot;Cutting out an armhole&quot; is a tragedy. These are some of the consequences&#8212;</p>
  <ol>
    <li> When the arm is raised, the dress will be drawn higher into the pit
    of the arm and will produce a drawing.</li>
    <li> The sleeve-cap bulges.</li>
    <li> The waist line is drawn upward.</li>
    <li> The sleeve-cap draws across the arm.</li>
    <li> The sleeve is tight through the back.</li>
    <li> The dress may burst out in the back.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Correction: Rip out the sleeve and raise the back until the armhole rests
    well into the pit of the arm. Repin the shoulder seam as the back is raised
    sufficiently high to bring the dress to within a half-inch of the armpit.</p>
  <p>The sleeve will also be altered. (See sleeve alterations.)</p>
  <h3>    The Back</h3>
  <ol start="6">
    <li class="clear"> <strong><a name="back6" id="back6"></a></strong><img src="images/08_shoulders-wide.jpg" alt="back bodice" width="132" height="190" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Garment too wide through the shoulders in the back</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Cause: This misfit often occurs on figures that are narrow through the upper
    cross-back and wide through the lower crossback. This figure usually requires
    a large bust size pattern and will find the back too wide and the shoulder
  seam dropping too low on the arm.</p>
  <p>The very erect figure often finds that the back of the pattern is too wide,
    as the bust is large in proportion to the back.</p>
  <p>Correction: The garment that has been cut only a trifle too wide will find
    it possible to alter the dress by taking up a few tucks at the back of the
    neck.</p>
  <p>The dress will necessarily be re-cut for the over-erect figure. The back
    will be too wide throughout and usually is too long in the depth of the back
    from the neck to the armpit. This is termed the &quot;Scye Depth.&quot;</p>
  <ol start="7">
    <li class="clear"><strong><a name="back7" id="back7"></a></strong><img src="images/08_narrow-shoulders.jpg" alt="back bodice" width="76" height="121" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />     Dress too narrow through the shoulders</li>
  </ol>
  <p> Cause: The figure may be unusually wide through the shoulders but is small
    through the bust, and the pattern that fits the bust size will be too narrow
    through the shoulders. In some cases the back is as much as two inches wider
  than the standard measurement.</p>
  <p>Correction: If the dress has been cut it will be ruined unless the back
    can be re-cut wider or possibly the sleeves changed to a looser style so
    that the sleeve can ride up on the shoulder and thus widen the back.</p>
  <ol start="8">
    <li class="clear"> <strong><a name="back8" id="back8"></a></strong>Crosswise<img src="images/08_crosswise-b.jpg" alt="bodice front with crosswise mark at center of armhole" width="69" height="126" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /> threads <img src="images/08_crosswise-a.jpg" alt="bodice back with crosswise mark at underarm" width="132" height="169" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />of material running up in the back</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Cause: This defect is caused by the dress being too short in the Scye Depth.
    The crosswise threads should run straight from armpit to armpit. This is
    very noticeable in checked material as the lines of the checks will run upward
    in the center back. Coats on stoop-shouldered figures also show this defect
    as the lower edge of the coat will &quot;hike&quot; up in the back.</p>
  <p>Correction: If the dress has been cut with a wide seam allowance, rip open
    the shoulder seam to the arm curve and drop the center back until the threads
    are straight from armpit to armpit.</p>
  <p>If there is not sufficient seam allowance the following alteration will
    be necessary: The length of the center back cannot be changed and the sides
    must be raised; therefore, rip open the underarm seams, rip out the sleeves,
    and raise the shoulder seam at the arm curve until the thread of material
    is straight. It will then most likely be necessary to lower the arm curve
    a trifle on the back only. This will lengthen the Scye Depth.</p>
  <p>This type of figure often finds the dress too long in the front from the
    armpit to the shoulder, while in the back the pattern was too short. (See
    directions for altering the front.)</p>
  <ol start="9">
    <li class="clear">    <strong><a name="back9" id="back9"></a></strong><img src="images/08_vertical-arm.jpg" alt="vertical line near armhole" width="69" height="125" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Vertical fold in the back of the dress near the arm</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Cause: This fold is necessary for freedom of motion and is required for
    comfort. This fold is visible when the figure is in a relaxed position with
    the arms to the side but will disappear when the arms are brought forward
    which indicates that, if this fold is fitted out, the dress will burst out
    in the back or will be most uncomfortable when in motion. The athletic tendencies
    of the present generation necessitate comfort.</p>
  <p>The greatest strain on the dress is not in the wearing, but in removing
    the garment over the head. If this fold was removed, it would be almost impossible
    to cross the arms and remove the dress. If the dress is opened down the back
    or opened wide at the side placket and the garment is either sleeveless or
    has puff sleeves, the dress can be fitted closer in the back and also at
    the underarms.</p>
  <ol start="10">
    <li class="clear">  <strong><a name="back10" id="back10"></a></strong><img src="images/08_sliding-back.jpg" alt="bodice front and back" width="132" height="166" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Neck and shoulders sliding back</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Cause: There may be one or more causes&#8212;</p>
  <ol>
    <li>  The back may be too short in the Scye Depth.</li>
    <li> The shoulders may be sloping which causes the dress to be short in
      the center back.</li>
    <li> The front may be too long from the chest line to the shoulder seam.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Correction: The alteration will be made in the shoulder seam. The front
    will either be lifted or the back will be lowered or both.</p>
  <ol start="11">
    <li class="clear"> <strong><a name="back11" id="back11"></a></strong><img src="images/08_wrinkles.jpg" alt="diagonal wrinkles and correction on bodice back" width="132" height="156" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Wrinkles</li>
  </ol>
  <p> Cause: The shoulders may be rounded or protruding, which makes the dress
    draw upward in the center back and indicates that the Scye Depth is too short.</p>
  <p>Correction: If sufficient seam allowance has been made, the shoulder seam
    can be opened and the center back dropped to remove the drawing. This lengthens
    the Style Depth.</p>
  <p>If the dress has no extra seam allowance, the dress must be re-cut in the
    back, dropping the armhole of the back only. In this case the front usually
    must be shortened, keeping the thread of material parallel with the floor
    at the bust line.</p>
  <ol start="12">
    <li class="clear"><strong><a name="back12" id="back12"></a></strong>     <img src="images/08_diagonal-wrinkles.jpg" alt="diagonal wrinkles at undearm of bodice, and correction" width="132" height="165" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Diagonal wrinkles from the shoulder blades to the underarm seam</li>
  </ol>
  <p> Cause: These wrinkles are caused by the lower crossback being too narrow.
    The upper crossback may be sufficiently wide but the figure enlarges through
    the
  lower back which will produce a drawing.</p>
  <p>Sloping shoulders may also be responsible.</p>
  <p>Correction: If there has been sufficient seam allowance in the armhole and
    the underarm seam, let out the seam so as to widen the back both at the armhole
    and at the underarm seam. This alteration will be made for full shoulders.</p>
  <p>For sloping shoulders, the back must be raised at the armhole so as to lengthen
    the Scye Depth. This can only be done by ripping out the sleeve and opening
    the shoulder and lifting the back, fitting at the sleeve seam so as to eliminate
    the wrinkles. Re-pin the sleeve. (See sleeve alterations.)</p>
  <ol start="13">
    <li class="clear"><strong><a name="back13" id="back13"></a></strong><img src="images/08_diagonal-neck.jpg" alt="diagonal wrinkles from neck to undearm, and correction" width="132" height="152" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />  Diagonal wrinkles from the neck to underarm seam</li>
  </ol>
  <p> Cause: Again, the Scye Depth is too short. This will only be found when the
    neck fits high in the front and fits close, which does not permit the dress
    falling down in the back. The lower crossback may also be too narrow. Tight
    fitting also emphasizes this misfit.</p>
<p>Correction: The Scye Depth must be lengthened, by dropping the dress in
    the center back if there is sufficient seam allowance. If not, the back must
    be lifted and the armhole cut lower in the back ONLY so as to lengthen the
    Scye Depth.</p>
<ol start="14">
  <li class="clear">     <strong><a name="back14" id="back14"></a></strong><img src="images/08_armpits-drawing.jpg" alt="lines across armpit, and correction" width="132" height="157" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Drawing through the armpits across the back</li>
</ol>
<p>Cause: This is caused by the dress being fitted too closely, which is often
    found on large figures. When large figures are seated, the bust raises and
    if the garment has been fitted very tight when standing, it will draw.</p>
  <p>Correction: If there is sufficient seam allowance, let out the underarm
    seam as much as required to eliminate the drawing when seated. If there is
    no seam allowance available, set in a gusset at the underarm and the same
    in the sleeve as the overtight sleeve is as much responsible for the drawing
    as the tight bodice.</p>

  </ol>
  <p>Cause: This misfit is very noticeable in tailored garments as the material
    is heavy and will bulge. It is usually found on the more square-shouldered
    figure. The high armhole raises the garment at the neck; and, as the low
    neck holds the garment down, the garment will bulge.</p>
  <p>Correction: Rip open the shoulder seam after removing the collar, lift the
    center back, and refit the shoulders until the bulge disappears.</p>

  </ol>
  <p> Cause: The figure evidently has a wide back in proportion to the front

    both the upper and the lower crossback are too narrow.</p>

  </ol>
  <p>Cause: This may be caused by one or more difficulties which could have been
    avoided had the dress been cut sufficiently large.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>  The forearm of the sleeve may have been cut too small.</li>
    <li>  The lower crossback may be too narrow.</li>
    <li> The upper sleeve may be too narrow.</li>
    <li> The armhole in the back may be too low.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Correction: See sleeve fitting.</p>
  <p>Rip out the sleeve in the back, put on the dress and as the arms are drawn
    forward, see if there is a gap between the sleeve and the back. If the sleeve
    cannot be repinned to the back with the arms folded in front, then the back
    is too narrow.</p>
  <p>Many arms are very much out of proportion to the rest of the body. They
    vary as much as four inches for one bust size. If the sleeve is made too
    tight, the dress will draw through the back as well as in the sleeve.</p>
  <p>Correction: Usually a new sleeve must be cut. This causes much discomfort
    on closely fitted dresses. To prove this, lift the back on any uncomfortable
    dress, pinning up a tuck from shoulder to shoulder (with the sleeve in).
    Notice the improvement in the feeling of the garment and the freedom with
    which the arms can be raised.</p>
  <p>Open the shoulders, remove the cap of the sleeve (only) and lift the back
    of the dress at the shoulder seam in the back section only. Raise the dress
    to the pit of the arm in the back.</p>

  <p>Correction: If there was sufficient seam allowed when cutting this can be

    curve on the elbow and may necessitate letting out some of the seam at the

  <h4>    <strong><img src="images/08_front-waist.jpg" alt="side view showing waistline" width="132" height="169" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /></strong>Front of waist</h4>
  <p>Fitting the front of the dress is complicated by the darts that are necessary,
    not only to fit the curved surface of the front of a woman's figure, but
    also retain the straight thread of material. As you view the figure from
    the side, you will find that even though the figure may have a small bust
    size, and is not stoop shouldered, the shoulders will recede noticeably and
    this curve must be fitted with the use of darts or gathers or intricate cutting
    of the front.</p>
  <ol>
    <li class="clear"><strong><a name="front1" id="front1"></a></strong>     <strong><img src="images/08_drawing-neck.jpg" alt="lines from neck to armhole and correction" width="132" height="168" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /></strong>Drawing from the neck to the armhole in front</li>
  </ol>
  <p> Cause: The armhole is either too tight, or the figure is very erect, and
    the front is too short from the waist to the neck at the shoulder seam. Large
    arms
  or sloping shoulders also cause this difficulty.</p>
  <p>Correction: Open the shoulder seam, and if there is sufficient seam allowance,
    drop the front at the neck of the shoulder seam. It may be found necessary
    to drop the whole shoulder, especially if the figure is very erect.</p>
  <p>If the arm is very large for the size, the shoulder seam may have to be
    dropped to provide more armhole, or if the dress is broad through the chest,
    the front of the armhole may be clipped one-quarter of an inch. This small
    amount will provide much more room. Clip cautiously.</p>
  <ol start="2">

  </ol>
  <p> Cause: Insufficient dart on the shoulder causes this bulging. A wide flat
    curve, cut for a neck line, when drawn together on the shoulders of the dress,
    draws
    the material into a pouch at the center front. The dress should lie flat
    across the chest.</p>
  <p>Correction: Open the shoulder seam and smooth the dress across the chest
    toward the arms so as to remove the pouch. The pouch will then appear in
    its proper place as a shoulder dart. It can be taken up as a dart or in small
    tucks. If sufficient seam allowance was not made when cutting, the back of
    the neck must be trimmed out into more of a boat shape to match the front,
    or if there is to be a flat collar, the front corner might be filled in with
    a patch.</p>
  <ol start="3">
    <li class="clear">    <strong><a name="front3" id="front3"></a><img src="images/08_pouch-chest.jpg" alt="correction to bodice for chest pouching away" width="132" height="141" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /></strong>Pouch across the chest</li>
  </ol>
  <p> Cause: This pouch usually appears when the figure is seated, and may be
    caused by the figure being very short in front from the armpits to the shoulders,
    or may be caused by the dress being fitted too tight through the bust line,
    especially at the armpits. The oversize arm will also cause a drawing across
  the chest and will produce a pouch.</p>
  <p>Closely-corseted figures will find that the bust lifts when seated, due
    to the compression in the front at the waist line. Therefore, the dress should
    be fitted sufficiently loose to permit it to drop into an easy line when
    seated. A large figure too closely corseted gives the appearance of being
    larger than it is and should not be fitted too tight.</p>
  <p>Correction: If the shoulder line of the front can be raised without altering
    the straight thread of material under the bust, then the front is too long,
    otherwise the front has been fitted too closely and must be let out. If there
    is no seam to let out at the underarm, nor any material to use for a gusset,
    it will be necessary to open the center front and set in a vest.</p>

  </ol>
  <p> Cause: The stooped figure will find that all her dresses will be too long
    in front from the armpit to the neck and the very short figure will often
    find
  the same difficulty.</p>
  <p>Correction: The alteration must be made above the bust line if the underarm
    seam is the right length. Do not draw out the extra length at the waist;
    this will throw out the straight thread of material. Open the shoulder seam
    and rip out the sleeve and raise the front at the shoulders. Recut the neck
    to fit.</p>

  </ol>
  <p> Cause: The short-waisted figure or the short figure will find this difficulty.
    The older woman is usually shorter-waisted than she was in her more youthful
  days and patterns and dresses must be shortened at the underarm seam for her.</p>
  <p>Correction: This alteration should be made in the pattern, taking up a tuck
    of equal width from the center front to the underarm seam. If this alteration
    was not made in the pattern, the dress must then be altered at the waist
    line.</p>

  </ol>
  <p> Cause: The figure that is over-erect and throws the shoulders back may
    find the chest too narrow, which will cause a drawing through the chest.
    This same
  drawing will be found on figures with over-large arms.</p>
  <p>Correction: This figure cannot be fitted very closely through the chest.
    Open the front of the armhole and see if the sleeve gaps away from the bodice.
    If so, the chest is too narrow and must be widened if possible. The hands
    should be clasped in the back when fitting the chest.</p>
  <p>An enlarged sleeve for the larger arm will also eliminate the difficulty.</p>

    <li class="clear">     <strong><a name="front7" id="front7"></a></strong><strong><img src="images/08_vert-fold-armhole.jpg" alt="vertical fold at front armhole" width="71" height="126" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /></strong>Vertical fold in front at the armhole</li>
  </ol>
  <p> Cause: This fold should appear when the figure is in a relaxed position
    but is needed when the hands are clasped in the back, which proves that it
    is necessary.</p>
  <p>Correction: Do not eliminate this fold. The whole dress may be fitted closer
    to eliminate both the fold in the back and also in the front if the arm-curve
    is made very close up to the arm and the sleeve cap very short. Otherwise
    the dress will draw.</p>

  </ol>
  <p> Cause: This is often found on the figure with the large bust size but with
    a narrow upper crossback. The armhole seam will drop down on the arm, while
  the lower back may be the correct width.</p>
  <p>Correction: The back can be made narrower at the upper crossback without
    removing the sleeves. The neck finish can be opened and small tucks taken
    at the back of the neck (they should be made from the wrong side).</p>
  <p>If a shoulder dart is not desired, the sleeve must be removed and the surplus
    material eased out at the armhole curve. (See sleeves.)</p>

  </ol>
  <p> Cause: Many figures have extra wide shoulders even though the bust size
    is not large.</p>
  <p>Correction: The pattern should be checked through the shoulders before the
    dress is cut, for unless there is a wide seam allowed, the dress may be cut
    too narrow through the back and this cannot be remedied. An individual back
    may be two inches wider than the standard pattern. This is often found in
    the very thin figures. A piece set into the underarm seam to enlarge the
    sleeve cap will be helpful.</p>

  </ol>
  <p> Cause: The very erect figure or the figure with sloping shoulders usually
    finds that the dresses are too short at the waist line. This is often attributed
  to shortness at the waist when the difficulty lies at the neck and shoulders.</p>
  <p>Correction: If there has been additional seam allowed when cutting, the
    shoulders can be dropped to give the needed length. If the underarm seam
    is short, the extra length can be added below the bust line.</p>

  </ol>
  <p> Cause: This drawing is caused by insufficient underarm dart and is usually
    found on the figure with the large bust. The figure with small hips in relation
  to the size of the bust often finds this difficulty.</p>
  <p>Correction: Open the underarm seam and raise the front at the underarm into
    a dart sufficiently large to remove the drawing. The drawing may also be
    removed by placing a few gathers under the bust.</p>
  <ol start="12">
    <li class="clear"><strong><a name="front12" id="front12"></a></strong>     <strong><img src="images/08_pouch-shoulder.jpg" alt="armhole darts and alterations" width="132" height="182" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /></strong>Pouch at the armhole in front</li>
  </ol>
  <p> Cause: Insufficient dart arrangement has caused this difficulty. The dart
    as given may be correct for the standard figure, but the figure that is not
    of
    standard measurement will find a great deal of difficulty with this problem,
    especially the large woman. The amateur dressmaker often stitches out this
    dart at the arm curve by making a dart running from the arm curve toward
    the bust. This always denotes amateurish efforts, and reexeperience in fitting
    larger women. Several of these small darts are sometimes used in designing
  an evening gown.</p>
  <p>Correction: If the armhole has been blocked out as suggested in the rules
    for seam-allowance, this pouch can be worked out easily. The dress should
    fit smoothly around the arm-curve without any pouch; therefore, smooth the
    material either upward or downward, and work out the pouch in either an underarm
    dart or a shoulder dart, whichever is preferred. A tailored style may use
    the shoulder dart, but otherwise the underarm dart is preferable.</p>
  <p>Smooth the material upward toward the shoulder for the shoulder dart, bringing
    over the extra material that was blocked out when cutting the armhole. Allow
    at least one inch for looseness by pinning up one inch of material (one-half
    inch in dart) in the armhole when fitting. Smooth out the rest of the pouch
    toward the neck and take up the pouch that appears at the shoulder into a
    shoulder dart.</p>
  <p>For the underarm dart, pin up one inch of the pouch for looseness and then
    smooth out the rest toward the underarm seam, drawing down the extra material
    in the armhole. Pin the underarm seam together as altered.</p>

  </ol>
  <p> Cause: This is caused by the waist being too short down the front, and
    the alteration must be made in the waist and not in the skirt.</p>
  <p>Correction: If possible, the waist should be dropped from the shoulders.
    If this is not possible, or the figure is very large in the abdomen, the
    skirt will be lifted at the waist line at the side seam and while the skirt
    will remain the same, the waist will be shortened at the side seam. In a
    one-piece front, this alteration can be made by taking up a dart at the waist
    line on the side seam, on the front only.</p>

  </ol>
  <p> Cause: This is the result of square shoulders, the shoulder seam sloping
    too much from the neck to the arm, or the garment being too long from the
    armpit
  to the neck.</p>
  <p>Correction: This can be altered by pinning out the surplus seam at the neck,
    both from the back and the front of the seam. It may also necessitate trimming
    out the back of the neck a trifle as the Scye Depth is short on square-shouldered
    figures.</p>

  </ol>
  <p> Cause: The figure with over-large arms may find that the armhole is too
    tight.</p>
  <p>Correction: Do not trim out under the arm. If the armhole is too tight,
    clip the front of the arm curve one-quarter of an inch. This will enlarge
    the armhole considerably. Be very careful not to clip too much.</p>

  </ol>
  <p> Cause: Many armholes are too large. The small armhole is very rare, but
    the large armhole is common.</p>
  <p>Correction: If the armhole is cut deep under the armpit it will make it
    too large. In this case lift the shoulder seams and thus raise the dress
    closer to the pit of the arm.</p>
  <p>If there is more than two inches looseness across the bust, the underarm
    seams may be taken up a trifle. The evening gown and the sleeveless dress
    can be fitted closer at the underarm than the dress with sleeves.</p>
  <p>If the looseness in the armhole appears at the front curve in the form of
    a pouch, this denotes incorrect dart fitting and must be corrected. (See
    12, pouch at the armhole.)</p>
  <ol start="17">
    <li class="clear">  <strong><a name="front17" id="front17"></a></strong>Armhole too high or too low Cause: Different figures require different
        armhole placement. The high armhole is seldom found as the dress drops
        from the shoulders. Correct costume fitting requires that the armhole
      be close to the pit of the arm.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Correction: The low armhole will be treated the same as when the armhole
    is too large (in the preceding paragraph). Lift the armhole to the pit of
    the arm if it hangs too low. It may be the front or it may be the back that
    needs lifting. Test with sleeves removed.</p>

  <p> Cause: The cause of this difficulty in fitting is that patterns are not
    cut for this type of figure.</p>
  <p>Correction: If the dress is to be fitted smooth at the waist line, it will
    be necessary to lift an additional dart at the underarm seam. It is sometimes
    necessary to have three darts to fit the large bust.</p>
  <p>Gathers at the waist placed under the bust also dispose of the surplus fullness.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><em><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="sleeves" id="sleeves"></a></font></strong></em>THE SLEEVE</h3>
  <ol>
    <li class="clear">  <strong><a name="sleeve1" id="sleeve1"></a></strong><strong><img src="images/08_drawing-armpit.jpg" alt="alterations to bodice and sleeve" width="132" height="149" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /></strong>Drawing across the sleeve at the armpit</li>
  </ol>
  <p> Cause: This drawing appears when the arm curve is cut too low at the
      underarm, which makes the sleeve cap too long and narrow across the top
      of the sleeve.
      This drawing also occurs on the overfleshy arm, as the sleeve cap is again
    too narrow.</p>
  <p>Correction: Permit the sleeve to remain basted into the dress when fitting,
    as a test for the amount to raise. Lift the dress in the back between the
    shoulders, bringing the dress well into the armpit in the back. Pin this
    into a tuck between the shoulders. Then bring the customer's arms forward
    and notice that the drawing has disappeared and the dress is made far more
    comfortable. If the dress is made and cannot be easily ripped on the customer,
    remove it as pinned, cut a pattern of the altered dress back above the armpits,
    and rip out the sleeves at the top and sides only. Rebaste the shoulders
    as marked from the new back pattern, which will indicate that the whole back
    will be raised, both on the shoulders and at the neck.</p>
  <p>The sleeve cap will now be too long. Run a basting thread around the top
    of the sleeve cap, basting off one inch or more at the top (do not cut).
    Then baste the altered sleeve line into the armhole easing in the fullness
    on the sides of the sleeves, not the top. The top of any sleeve is basted
    in with no fullness.</p>

  </ol>
  <p> Cause: The sleeve is too small for the arm. (Arms are often out of proportion.)</p>
  <p>Correction: It is very difficult to alter the cap of a sleeve. It is advisable
    to purchase a new sleeve pattern of a larger size; keep it for a future guide
    for altering other sleeves and cut all sleeves to this size.</p>
  <p>If , however, the sleeve must be altered on the customer, open the underarm
    seam, set in a gusset or let out the seam, and then trim out the lower curve
    of the sleeve one inch, as a trial. Do not trim off the sides, as they are
    now too narrow. Trimming out the curve will widen the sides but will shorten
    the sleeve. The sleeve will then be raised to the armhole of the dress and
    repinned, pinning off the top of the sleeve and not the sides of the sleeve
    cap. This alteration can be made only on short arms as it will shorten the
    sleeve.</p>

    <li class="clear">    <strong><a name="sleeve3" id="sleeve3"></a></strong><strong><img src="images/08_armpit-elbow.jpg" alt="sleeve with diagonal wrinkles at armpit" width="79" height="152" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /></strong>Diagonal wrinkles across the front of the sleeve from the armpit
    to the elbow</li>
  </ol>
  <p> Cause: These wrinkles appear on the fitted sleeve when the arm is raised
    but will disappear when the arm is lowered. The sleeve should not wrinkle
    when
  the arm is hanging to the side.</p>
  <p>Correction: Some of these wrinkles can be eliminated by fitting the sleeve
    a trifle closer at the upper arm. These wrinkles merely denote the looseness
    in the sleeve if they only appear when the arm is raised. If the wrinkles
    are in the sleeve when the arm is lowered and are running downward toward
    the elbow, the sleeve cap may be too long. The elbow of the sleeve might
    even be too tight, which would also cause this drawing.</p>

  </ol>
  <p> Cause: These wrinkles run in the opposite direction to those described
    in paragraph 3 of this lesson. They will appear when the arm is relaxed.
    This indicates
  that the armhole in the dress is too low, or the sleeve cap is too short.</p>
  <p>Correction: Lift the dress on the shoulders and see if the wrinkles disappear.
    It may be necessary only to lift the front and not the back. If the armhole
    is high and cannot be lifted, rip out the top of the sleeve and drop the
    cap.</p>

  </ol>
  <p> Cause: Some sleeve patterns are cut with very narrow sleeve caps, especially
    for the large arm. In this case there will be an uncomfortable drawing across
  the sleeve cap from the back to front.</p>
  <p>Correction: If the dress has been cut with extra seam allowance, the sleeve
    cap can be let out. Otherwise a larger sleeve must be cut.</p>

  </ol>
  <p> Cause: This is caused by the arm being too large for the sleeve. The sleeve
  is too tight.</p>
  <p>Correction: The sleeve must be enlarged at the upper portion either by letting
    out the seams or by setting in a gusset.</p>
  <ol start="7">
    <li class="clear"><strong><a name="sleeve7" id="sleeve7"></a></strong>    <strong><img src="images/08_fold-back.jpg" alt="vertical folds on sleeves" width="78" height="149" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /></strong>Vertical fold in front and in the back of the sleeve</li>
  </ol>
  <p> Cause: This fold is necessary for freedom of motion. There will be a vertical
    fold both in back and front when the arm is hanging to the side but will
    disappear when the arm is brought to the front or drawn to the back, or when
    the arms
  are brought over the head.</p>
  <p>Correction: Athletic tendencies require ease in the sleeves. If these folds
    are fitted out, it will place a strain on the dress and will soon burst out
    in the armhole. To prove this point, pin out this ease by narrowing the sleeve
    cap near the pit of the arm and note the result when the arms are in motion,
    especially raised above the head.</p>

  </ol>
  <p> Cause: The arm with the surplus flesh hanging low on the upper arm requires
  a large sleeve but a small armhole.</p>
  <p>Correction: This fitting can be accomplished by fitting the armhole closely
    and then taking up a small dart in the under edge of the sleeve cap. Do not
    attempt to ease in all the extra fullness in the sleeve cap. There should
    only be one and one-half inches ease in the whole sleeve cap.</p>

  </ol>
  <p> Cause: This is caused by incorrect fitting on the shoulders or incorrect
    sleeve setting.</p>
  <p>Correction: Open the shoulders and lift up the front portion of the dress
    at the shoulder seam. It may also be necessary to drop the back shoulder
    seam. After the shoulders are fitted, drop the customer's arm to the side
    and smooth the sleeve to the top of the arm, evenly dividing the fullness
    on the back and the front of the sleeve. Pin the top to position and pin
    in the sleeve flat an inch and one-half on each side of the top. The sleeve
    must be flat for three inches across the top of the sleeve. Ease out all
    the remaining fullness on the sides of the sleeve, both the back and the
    front.</p>

    <li class="clear">     <strong><a name="sleeve10" id="sleeve10"></a></strong><strong><img src="images/08_short-back.jpg" alt="alteration to sleeve" width="132" height="154" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /></strong>Sleeve short in the back or long in front</li>
  </ol>
  <p> Cause: When the arm is unusually muscular, possibly in the lower arm, it
    gives the feeling of the sleeve drawing at the elbow or, as some express
    it, the
    sleeve is too short in the back. This is often found on very thin arms, as
    the lower-arm is large in proportion to the upperarm. When the upper-arm
    is closely fitted, the lower-arm is too tight and the sleeve will be too
    short
  in the back.</p>
  <p>Correction: This alteration may be made on the pattern if one is aware of
    the necessity of the alteration before the dress is cut. The back of the
    sleeve requires more curve, and this can be secured by taking up a dart in
    the one-piece sleeve pattern, making the dart one-half inch at the front
    of the seam and graduating it to nothing at the back of the sleeve. This
    will shorten the front of the sleeve one inch, and this additional fullness
    must be taken up in an additional dart at the elbow. It may then be necessary
    to lengthen the sleeve by measuring the arm at the front of the seam.</p>
  <p>If the sleeve has been cut with additional seam allowance, this extra dart
    can be lifted in the back edge of the sleeve seam and then fitted to the
    wrist. (See wrist fitting.)</p>

  </ol>
  <p> Cause: Many sleeve patterns are cut without any fullness at the elbow,
    and, if the wrist is then fitted closely, the sleeve will twist on the arm.</p>
  <p>Correction: The same alteration will be made on this sleeve as is made on
    the sleeve that is short in the back. (See paragraph 10.)</p>

  </ol>
  <p> Cause: This is usually the fault of the seamstress and not of the sleeve.
    If the sleeve is set in correctly there will be no apparent fullness in the
    sleeve
  cap. Too much seam may have been allowed on both the sleeve cap and armhole.</p>
  <p>Correction: There should be one and one-half inches fullness in the sleeve
    cap, three-quarters of an inch on the back and three-quarters inch on the
    front of the sleeve. This fullness should all be eased out on the bias section
    of the sleeve cap, which is half way down on the back and front of the cap.</p>

  </ol>
  <p> Cause: Many arms are too large for the pattern. The arm is out of proportion
  to the body.</p>
  <p>Correction: A slight alteration can be made if an additional seam allowance
    has been cut. The seam can be let out and be made to fit. Otherwise it is
    advisable to purchase a larger sleeve pattern and then retain it as a guide
    for the sleeve cap that will be necessary to use on all sleeves thereafter.
    The sleeve may have to be recut. (Or see paragraph 2.)</p>
  <ol start="14">
    <li class="clear"><strong><a name="sleeve14" id="sleeve14"></a></strong>     <strong><img src="images/08_sleeve-large.jpg" alt="sleeve alteration" width="127" height="131" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /></strong>Sleeve too large</li>
  </ol>
  <p> Cause: The arm may be very small in proportion to the bust size, which
    will not only make the sleeve too large but the armhole will also be too
    large.</p>
  <p>Correction: If there is to be much change, a new sleeve-pattern should be
    purchased and the sleeve recut. It is very difficult even for the experienced
    seamstress to &quot;fit out&quot; a sleeve. If the sleeve must be altered
    on the customer, take in the underarm seam, allowing at least one inch for
    ease on the upper arm. Do not change the underarm curve of the sleeve very
    much, as it will quickly become too small. Make little if any change at the
    top of the sleeve, and make the seam in the sleeve on the sides a trifle
    deeper than for the original pattern. Do not cut off any of the sleeve cap
    until tried on the customer.</p>
  <ol start="15">
    <li class="clear"><strong><a name="sleeve15" id="sleeve15"></a></strong>     <strong><img src="images/08_sleeve-small-b.jpg" alt="alteration to bodice" width="132" height="170" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /></strong>Sleeve too small for the armhole</li>
  </ol>
  <p> Cause: If the dress has been cut correctly from the pattern, the sleeve
    should fit the armhole with the additional ease that has been given, but
    if the sleeve
    is taken in and the body remains the same, then the armhole will be too large.
    On very large arms, the sleeve may fit correctly as to the circular size,
    but the armhole is too large for the customer and there seems to be a pouch
    of
  goods at the front of the waist at the armhole.</p>
  <p>Correction: This requires refitting the front of the dress. (See front fitting;
    darts.) There is not sufficient dart arrangement, or this pouch would not
    appear. The front of the dress must be drawn down at the underarm into an
    additional underarm dart so as to draw out this pouch. If there has not been
    additional seam or material allowed when cutting the armhole (see additional
    seam allowance) it will be necessary to set in a gusset on the front of the
    waist at the underarm seam. The extra dart will make a smaller armhole.</p>
  <ol start="16">
    <li class="clear">     <strong><a name="sleeve16" id="sleeve16"></a></strong><strong><img src="images/08_sleeve-tight.jpg" alt="sleeve alteration" width="76" height="146" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /></strong>Sleeve too tight below the elbow</li>
  </ol>
  <p> Cause: The thin arm is more muscular than the fleshy arm and enlarges more
  when drawn up; hence the tightness on the lower arm when the arm is bent.</p>
  <p>Correction: The sleeve must be enlarged below the elbow by letting out the
    back edge of the sleeve. If the additional seam has been allowed the sleeve
    can be opened below the elbow and the back edge of the seam curved out sufficiently
    to fit the arm as the arm is held up to the face. Retain the front edge of
    the sleeve, which is straighter than the back.</p>
  <ol start="17">
    <li class="clear"><strong><a name="sleeve17" id="sleeve17"></a></strong><strong><img src="images/08_sleeve-elbow.jpg" alt="sleeve alterations" width="132" height="158" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /></strong>     Sleeve too tight above the elbow</li>
  </ol>
  <p> Cause: Some arms are very large just above the elbow. The flesh may hang
    in a pouch in some cases. This arm is often very difficult to fit with a
    closely-fitted
    sleeve, as the arm above the elbow is almost the same width as the upper
    arm and the lower arm is usually small.</p>
  <p>Correction: This arm requires a peculiarly shaped sleeve, with a great deal
    of fullness in the elbow. Open the full length of the sleeve and let out
    the seam above the elbow, to fit the flexed arm. Darts will then be lifted
    in the back edge of the seam at the elbow, usually making three or four small
    darts. The lower arm will also be fitted as it is flexed. It is advisable
    to use a sleeve with a vertical dart.</p>

  </ol>
  <p> Cause: The arm is short for the pattern.</p>
  <p>Correction: The pattern will be altered above the elbow unless there is
    a special design of the sleeve that would throw it out of balance by reducing
    the length of the top only. Practically all arms require the change above
    the elbow.</p>
  <p>Measure the length of the arm and shorten the pattern to this length by
    taking up a crosswise tuck across the pattern above the elbow.</p>
  <p>If the sleeve is cut, it may be shortened at the wrist and the dart raised
    in the elbow.</p>
  <ol start="19">
    <li class="clear">     <strong><a name="sleeve19" id="sleeve19"></a></strong><strong><img src="images/08_sleeve-short.jpg" alt="sleeve alteration" width="81" height="142" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /></strong>Sleeve too short</li>
  </ol>
  <p> Cause: The very long arm will find the pattern too short. Figures with
    extra broad backs often have normal length arms but the back shortens the
    sleeve.
  In this case it is the back section that requires the alteration.</p>
  <p>Correction: The sleeve will also be lengthened above the elbow. Set in a
    crosswise strip of paper and lengthen the sleeve the desired amount. This
    must be done before the dress is cut.</p>
  <ol start="20">
    <li class="clear">     <strong><a name="sleeve20" id="sleeve20"></a></strong><strong><img src="images/08_sleeve-wrist.jpg" alt="sleeve alteration" width="79" height="146" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /></strong>Sleeve too large at the wrist</li>
  </ol>
  <p> Cause: Many patterns do not give a fitted wrist that is desired in a fitted
  dress.</p>
  <p>Correction: The alteration is made on the back edge of the sleeve seam from
    the elbow to the wrist. Draw the back of the seam under the front edge, retaining
    the line of the front edge of the sleeve. This will make a more bias seam
    line in the back. Take up the surplus in a dart at the elbow.</p>
  <h3><em><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="skirt" id="skirt"></a></font></strong></em>THE SKIRT</h3>
  <p>    Skirt fitting A dress made with the waist cut in one with the skirt must
      be altered without recognizing any definite waist line, other than at the
      side seams, and unless the dress has been cut with additional seam allowance
      at the neck and shoulders, it may be necessary to sacrifice in the length
      at the hem when fitting.</p>
  <p>This emphasizes the importance of making additional seam allowance as directed,
    for if the waist and skirt are cut separately, there will be no provision
    for a waist alteration. In fact there should be none made, except for the
    figure with the prominent abdomen or in shortening a waist at the side seams.</p>
  <p>The waist and skirt should be joined together at the waist line permanently
    before fitting, as all alterations will be made elsewhere. (See fitting.)</p>
  <ol>
    <li class="clear"><strong><a name="skirt1" id="skirt1"></a><img src="images/08_short-cf.jpg" alt="dress with dart under arm, and dress with tuck at waist" width="132" height="162" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /></strong>    Dress short in center front</li>
  </ol>
  <p> Cause: If the dress is short in the center front it is due to insufficient
    length from the shoulder to the waist line and not from the waist line to
    the hem as is supposed. The dart at the underarm was not raised sufficiently
    to
    straighten the thread of material under the bust line, and hence the sagging
  at the side and the shortness in front.</p>
  <p>Correction: Open the side seam and also the underarm seam so that an additional
    dart can be raised at the bust line in the front. If the figure has a prominent
    abdomen, this dart can be taken at the waist line.</p>
  <ol start="2">
    <li class="clear"><strong><a name="skirt2" id="skirt2"></a></strong><strong><img src="images/08_skirt-front.jpg" alt="alterations to bodice atop skirt" width="132" height="145" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /></strong>     Skirt stands out in front</li>
  </ol>
  <p> Cause: This is usually found on loosely fitted skirts and in the peculiar
    posture where the figure stands with rounded shoulders, flat seat and prominent
    abdomen.
  This often occurs on a garment cut straight with no dart arrangement.</p>
  <p>Correction: Rip open the side seams and lift the seam at the bust line,
    making a dart. If the figure is of the fatigue posture, the front of the
    waist may have to be raised at the neck and shoulders. The back may require
    lengthening at the neck and shoulders.</p>
  <ol start="3">
    <li><strong><a name="skirt3" id="skirt3"></a></strong>  Skirt sagging on the sides Cause: Stretchy material may cause the
      skirt to sag on the sides, as the seam is heavy, but if firmly woven material
        sags, it is misfitting if the skirt is not full and the thread of material
        runs decidedly downward on the sides.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Correction: If the skirt sags on the sides, in the thread of material, it
    will usually be found that the front is also short. The side seams will then
    be raised in the underarm dart as directed in the previous paragraph.</p>
  <ol start="4">
    <li class="clear">  <strong><a name="skirt4" id="skirt4"></a></strong><strong><img src="images/08_cups-in.jpg" alt="side view of dress, showing it cupping in below abdomen" width="57" height="177" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /></strong>Skirt &quot;cups in&quot; in front</li>
  </ol>
  <p> Cause: This difficulty is often encountered on the figure with the prominent
    abdomen when the hips are fitted too close. This type of figure should not
  wear the molded hip line but should rather fit the hips a trifle looser.</p>
  <p>Correction: If there is sufficient seam allowance it is advisable to let
    out the side seams until the front drops into its correct position, hanging
    straight down from the waist.</p>
  <ol start="5">
    <li class="clear">     <strong><a name="skirt5" id="skirt5"></a></strong><strong><img src="images/08_drawing-front.jpg" alt="side view of dress, showing alteration" width="54" height="160" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /></strong>Side seam drawing toward the front</li>
  </ol>
  <p> Cause: Posture causes this difficulty the fatigue posture in this case-where
    the seat is flattened and the abdomen protrudes. This throws the back of
    the skirt in and the front out.</p>
  <p>Correction: The back of the skirt should be raised at the belt line and
    at the side seams. This will lengthen the front in proportion to the back
    and sides and will straighten the seams at the sides. The side seams should
    hang perpendicular to the floor.</p>
  <ol start="6">
    <li class="clear">    <strong><a name="skirt6" id="skirt6"></a></strong><strong><img src="images/08_toward-back.jpg" alt="dress with corrections marked" width="132" height="160" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /></strong>Side seams drawing toward the back</li>
  </ol>
  <p> Cause: Posture also causes this difficulty. The sway back figure usually
    has a large seat and the extra material needed in the back will draw the
    seam toward
    the back. The additional length needed in the center back for this figure
    also draws up the material in the center and will draw the side seams back.</p>
  <p>Correction: The front of the skirt must be lifted, or possibly the whole
    front lifted at the shoulders. The main fitting will be made in the back
    at the waist line either in a crosswise dart, fitted to the curves of the
    body, or darts may be made in the skirt at the side back. A separate skirt
    for this type of figure should be made with darts on both sides of the center
    back rather than fitting closely at the waist line on the sides. The darts
    will insure keeping the crosswise thread of material straight at the hips
    from side to side.</p>

  </ol>
  <p> Cause: This deep curve is prominent because all the bodily curves are shown.
  This type of figure usually has a large abdomen also.</p>
  <p>Correction: This defect can be corrected by &quot;optical illusion&quot;.
    Drop the waist line for two or three inches below the natural waist line
    both in the front and in the back; this will lengthen the waist line and
    the deep curve of the back will be covered.</p>

  </ol>
  <p> Cause: The garment has been made so as to emphasize the abdomen and the
    design should be altered to produce a different effect.</p>
  <p>Correction: The waist line should be lowered. This figure should never wear
    a defined natural waist line. In lowering the waist line the curves of the
    body are less emphasized and the lines are straighter.</p>
  <p>The prominence of the abdomen is also greatly diminished if the dress is
    fitted looser. This type of figure should not wear the molded lines. The
    dress should fall almost straight down from the waist to the hem. It should
    not cut under below the abdomen.</p>
  <p>The side seams should be opened if possible or the skirt may be raised.</p>
  <ol start="9">
    <li>  <strong><a name="skirt9" id="skirt9"></a></strong>Hips too tight Cause: Many figures are larger in the hips than in
      the bust in pattern proportions. In this case the pattern may be too small
        in the hips. This type of figure requires the dress cut larger through
        the hips.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Correction: If the dress has been cut with ample seam allowance, the side
    seams can be let out. The pattern should be checked and extra allowance made
    when cutting.</p>
  <ol start="10">
    <li class="clear"><strong><a name="skirt10" id="skirt10"></a></strong>     <strong><img src="images/08_tight-thighs.jpg" alt="skirt correction if too tight across thighs" width="132" height="161" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /></strong>Thighs too tight</li>
  </ol>
  <p> Cause: Many figures are heavy in the thighs, which is about four inches
    below the hip line. This figure spreads greatly when seated and, if the dress
    is
    fitted closely at the hip line, the side seams will be too tight when the
    figure is seated.</p>
  <p>Correction: This figure requires more slant to the side seams. They cannot
    be cut as straight as the skirt for the small-thigh woman, even though her
    hips may be large. There must be room for spreading below the hip line. This
    will make the lower edge of the skirt wider, as it is usually necessary to
    add at least two inches at the hem line on the side of each side seam. This
    will enlarge the lower edge of the skirt eight inches. Extra allowance must
    be made when cutting the garment.</p>
  <ol start="11">
    <li class="clear">  <strong><a name="skirt11" id="skirt11"></a></strong><strong><img src="images/08_hips-loose.jpg" alt="skirt alteration if too loose across hips" width="63" height="180" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /></strong>Hips too loose</li>
  </ol>
  <p> Cause: Many figures are larger in the bust than in the hips in relation to
    the pattern. This will require alterations on the side seams.</p>
<p>Correction: The side seams must be fitted closer. The line of the seam should
    run straight dorm the side from the underarm to the floor. If the figure
    is large through the front, the alteration may be made on the back portion
    of the seam only. If the figure is large in the back, the alteration will
    be made on the front seam only.</p>
<ol start="12">
  <li class="clear">     <strong><a name="skirt12" id="skirt12"></a></strong><strong><img src="images/08_bursting-side.jpg" alt="skirt alteration" width="66" height="182" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /></strong>Seams bursting on the side</li>
</ol>
<p> Cause: This is caused by the thighs being fitted too closely. Seams seldom
  split if the hip line only is fitted close. The strain is below the hip line.</p>
  <p>Correction: The side seams should be cut wider to allow for the spread of
    the thighs when seated. Raise the skirt if possible. This allowance must
    be made when cutting the garment.</p>
  <ol start="13">
    <li class="clear">     <strong><a name="skirt13" id="skirt13"></a><img src="images/08_drawing-pleats.jpg" alt="skirt alteration for pleats" width="75" height="183" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /></strong>Pleats drawing</li>
  </ol>
  <p> Cause: This again is usually caused by the thighs being full and the figure
  spreading when seated.</p>
  <p>Correction: There should be no change made on the pleats, but the side seams
    should be widened. Pleats should be considered as a flat piece of the skirt,
    and should be fitted as they are basted together. If the closely basted pleats
    draw, then the skirt will also draw when finished.</p>
  <ol start="14">
    <li class="clear">     <strong><a name="skirt14" id="skirt14"></a></strong><strong><img src="images/08_pleats-open.jpg" alt="correction if pleats stand open" width="74" height="177" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /></strong>Pleats standing open</li>
  </ol>
  <p> Cause: If pleats are not basted flat along the edges and pressed before
    they are set into the dress, or before they are stitched across the top,
    they will
  surely spread when the customer is seated. Tight thighs may also be the cause.</p>
  <p>Correction: If the dress is made the pleated section must be ripped out
    and basted flat and pressed before it is set into the dress. Be sure and
    press the top of the pleats before stitching them down. To test for tight
    thighs, open the side seams from the hips down and see if it spreads. Pin
    together in an easy fitting,</p>
  <ol start="15">
    <li class="clear">     <strong><a name="skirt15" id="skirt15"></a></strong><strong><img src="images/08_pleats-sagging.jpg" alt="correction for sagging pleats" width="124" height="174" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /></strong>Pleats sagging</li>
  </ol>
  <p> Cause: The lower edge of pleats will sag on the under side of the hem unless
  they are made correctly.</p>
  <p>Correction: Rip out the hem; baste each pleat down the outer edge to the
    edge of the material with the hem open. After the pleats are basted to the
    lower edge, the mark for the hem will then be made across the pleats and
    the hem will be pressed in with a warm iron, as pleated. Do not remove the
    bastings until the hem is pressed in. The beatings are then removed and the
    hem is basted up on the crease. The hem is then made and pressed. (See lesson
    on pleats.)</p>
  <ol start="16">
    <li class="clear">  <strong><a name="skirt16" id="skirt16"></a></strong><strong><img src="images/08_cupping-under.jpg" alt="side view showing skirt cupping in below buttocks" width="57" height="153" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /></strong>Skirt &quot;cupping under&quot; the seat</li>
  </ol>
  <p> Cause: Posture may cause this difficulty when the abdomen is thrust out
    and the back is thus flattened. The skirt will then pouch out in the front
    and
  drop in below the seat in the back. The hips and thighs may also be too tight.</p>
  <p>Correction: This can be corrected by lifting the back at the waist line
    either with a crosswise dart at the waist or by lifting the whole back. If
    the hips or thighs are too tight, the seam must be let out or the skirt must
    be raised at the waist line.</p>
  <ol start="17">
    <li class="clear"><strong><a name="skirt17" id="skirt17"></a></strong>     <strong><img src="images/08_circular-fullness.jpg" alt="circular skirt with fullness" width="76" height="181" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /></strong>Changing location of fullness in circular skirt</li>
  </ol>
  <p> Cause: The difference in the draping qualities of material often produce
    the undesired effect in the fullness on a circular skirt.</p>
  <p>Correction: The circular section is usually set on to a yoke. The location
    of the fullness can be changed by ripping off the yoke and lifting the circular
    section in the place where it is desired.</p>
  <ol start="18">
    <li>     <strong><a name="skirt18" id="skirt18"></a></strong>Skirts sagging </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Cause: This may be caused by posture if the dress is new,
        or the material may have been drawn out of shape in cleaning, or the
    dress may not be fitted correctly at the shoulders, or the material may be
    sagging
        on the bias.</p>
  <p>Correction: If the dress has been fitted according to the rules given herein,
    the material may be sagging on the bias and the skirt will require rehanging.</p>
  <ol start="19">
    <li>     <strong><a name="skirt19" id="skirt19"></a></strong>Skirt too long </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Cause: Be sure that the waist line is fitted correctly
        before judging the skirt. Fit the waist line first.</p>
  <p>Correction: The skirt can be shortened two inches without destroying the
    design of the garment, but more than that would be detrimental, unless the
    skirt yoke is also altered. In this case one-third should be taken from the
    yoke and two-thirds taken from the lower edge of the skirt. The pattern should
    be altered before the dress is cut to save material.</p>
  <ol start="20">
    <li class="clear">  <strong><a name="skirt20" id="skirt20"></a></strong><strong><img src="images/08_skirt-short.jpg" alt="alteration for short skirt" width="132" height="164" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /></strong>Skirt too short</li>
  </ol>
  <p> Cause: This alteration is more difficult if the dress has been cut or a short
    dress is to be remodeled.</p>
<p>Correction: It is always advisable to lengthen the pattern before cutting
    the dress. Unless a hem has been allowed, the short dress may prove a tragedy.
    There are very few ways that a dress can be lengthened without being noticed.
    If a yoke effect is set into the skirt to lengthen, then there should be
    some of the same material used in the waist and sleeves to balance the design.</p>
  <p>Most fashion papers offer designs that can be used for remodeling, making
    separate waists and skirts, or combining two different materials in a garment.
    It would be advisable to select one of these patterns and follow it as closely
    as possible.</p>
  <p> Coats can be lengthened more easily as to the design. A piece can be set
      on the lower edge in a pointed design, so as to make it appear that the
    coat was so designed. The material should match as closely as possible. If
    not,
      the same material should be used for collars and cuffs.</p>
  <ol start="21">
    <li class="clear">     <strong><a name="skirt21" id="skirt21"></a></strong><strong><img src="images/08_shorten-flare.jpg" alt="shortening a skirt with flares" width="132" height="164" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" /></strong>Shortening flares</li>
  </ol>
  <p> Cause: Circular flares should be shortened in the pattern if possible.
    If the fullness is all cut from the lower edge, the fullness will be sacrificed.</p>
  <p>Correction: Measure the pattern down the center front and center back to
    determine the amount to be shortened. Fold the pattern on the center line
    about half the distance between the hem and the upper edge. Make the fold
    even along the center edge. Then flatten the fold or tuck across the full
    width of the pattern. It will not run straight with the hem line but will
    be straight with the thread of material. A new side line can be made joining
    the uneven line made by the fold.</p>

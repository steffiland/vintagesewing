  <h4> Necessary tools </h4>
  <p>A modern sewing room, well-equipped with all conveniences, is every home
    sewer's dream; but this luxury is seldom enjoyed by the average home sewer
    of moderate means. Her sewing room may be her bedroom or her kitchen with
    only a few tools with which to work, but her sewing may be a work of art.</p>
  <p>An elaborate array of sewing tools is most convenient but not essential.
    All that is necessary to make the first dress is a sharp pair of shears,
    a thimble that fits, plenty of pins, an iron and a table, and needle and
    thread. It is the skill and not the tools that perfects the garment.</p>
  <h4>    The Iron
    most important
sewing tool </h4>
  <p>The most helpful tool in the work room is the iron and, strange to say,
    it is seldom mentioned as an important tool, and is usually not used until
    the dress is finished and &quot;ready to be pressed.&quot;</p>
  <p>The iron is the seamstress' best friend if she knows how and when to use
    it. It will save much time and perfect more of her work than many hours spent
    in basting. The iron is used in practically every step in constructive sewing
    and should be ready at all times. As the kitchen, where the family iron and
    ironing board can be used, is not always the best place to sew, it is advisable
    to purchase a two- or three-pound pressing iron that is generally used when
    traveling and is excellent for sewing. The <a href="#pressboard">following
    lesson</a> will explain
    how to make a small press broad. This small iron and press board can be kept
    close at hand when sewing. A large iron will be used for tailoring and for
    final pressing.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/01_bent.jpg" alt="shears with bent handles" width="132" height="45" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Shears with
bent handles</h4>
  <p>The shears are next in importance&#8212;good shears that actually cut a
    true line and do not hackle the goods. Shears are the large-size cutting
    instrument; the smaller ones are called scissors. The larger the hands and
    the heavier the material to cut, the larger the shears should be. The tailor
    uses very heavy shears but the dressmaker with lighter-weight material to
  cut and with smaller hands, should use the smaller shears.</p>
  <p>Shears should be carefully selected; the style with the bent handles are
    preferable. When the shears are held in a cutting position the goods is not
    raised as far off the table as with shears that have straight handles. Dressmaking
    shears should measure from nine to ten inches the full length of the blades
    and handle. They should be kept sharp at all times as will be explained later.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    Pinking <img src="images/01_pinking.jpg" alt="pinking shears" width="132" height="65" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Shears</h4>
  <p> The modern dressmaker's cutting tool is the pinking shears, made sufficiently
    light-weight that they can be easily handled. The edges of all seams are
    finished with notched edges as they are cut. This is a valuable aid to the
    woman who
  sews.</p>
  <h4>Scissors with
    large finger
sections </h4>
  <p>Scissors are smaller and are used for small cutting, trimming and ripping.
    The regular style straight handles are satisfactory, but they should have
    the wide space for the fingers. Single finger spaces for sewing scissors
    are uncomfortable to use. Scissors can be of any size but six to seven inches
    in length is excellent.</p>
  <h4>    Left-handed
shears </h4>
  <p>Left-handed shears and scissors are a boon to the left-handed woman. She
    alone can appreciate this convenience as the right-handed shears bruise the
    flesh when cutting heavy material.</p>
  <h4>    Razor blades
for ripping </h4>
  <p>A razor blade is another sewing convenience if not a necessity. Use the
    kind with the ridge on one edge. This type is used in the Gem safety razor.
    If old blades are not available new ones can be purchased very cheap, or
    a safety blade ripper that has a handle can be purchased. How to rip with
    the razor blade will be explained later.</p>
  <h4>    Tape,
    Small rule
    Long rule,
Square </h4>
  <p>Measuring equipment must also be on hand, for the good dressmaker cannot
    sew accurately without it. Purchase a heavy tape line and do not at any time
    use it for a string. The cheap thin tapes are often not true and will stretch.
    If the tape line is heavy it will not be abused as quickly and will retain
    its shape. Keep a small ruler in the sewing basket, for it will be used often;
    a clearly marked foot rule is excellent. The yardstick is not used so often
    but is necessary for straightening long lines. The tailor's square is a convenience
    but not a necessity.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/01_thimble.jpg" alt="thimbles" width="112" height="136" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Thimble that
fits</h4>
  <p>The thimble is not only a convenience but a necessity for sewing rapidly
    with fine stitches. One can sew without a thimble the same as one can walk
    without shoes but the thimble speeds the work and makes it more nearly perfect.
    Select a thimble that actually fits the shape of the finger. The long tapering
    finger requires a long tapering thimble. The blunt finger requires the short
    blunt thimble. Select the thimble carefully for there is a difference, it
    should not be loosely fitted as it will fall off; nor should it compress
    the end of the finger. It should stay on the finger and be comfortable.</p>
  <h4>    Dressmakers'
Pins No. 4 </h4>
  <p>An abundance of pins is another necessity that is often forgotten. It requires
    an abundance of pins to fasten on a pattern (for the whole pattern should
    be pinned before cutting) and practically every portion is pinned to place
    before basting or stitching. Use pins that are of a convenient size to hold.
    Number 4 pins are convenient. Box pins are also more convenient than pins
    in the paper for they are easily picked up when working. If pins in papers
    are secured or if a box is purchased, place a handful in a small box with
    a close-fitted lid for general use. Keep new fresh pins for pinning all white
    materials. Cheap pins are made for pinning paper only for they make black
    marks on light materials.</p>
  <h4>    Needles
No. 7 </h4>
  <p>A general supply of needles is also helpful. Different sizes are not necessary
    as very small needles are difficult to use and large needles are too long
    to use with the thimble and do not make small stitches or even sewing. Number
    7 needles offer an average length and size, both for hand sewing and basting.
    A fold of heavy material wrapped around the arm of the sewing machine at
    the top will offer an excellent needle cushion when working. This may cover
    one of the oil holes and it must not be forgotten when oiling the machine.
    Crewel needles with the long eyes, are excellent for those who have poor
    eyesight. They can be purchased in the same sizes as the regular needle.
    There is also a clever threading device for the sewing machine that is offered
    at a nominal charge by the sewing machine companies. This makes it possible
    to thread the machine by hooking the thread through the needle. One can FEEL
    the threading rather than see it.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/01_bodkin.jpg" alt="bodkin" width="132" height="14" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Bodkin for 
tailored loops</h4>
  <p>A bodkin is a blunt darning needle and will also be found useful. There
    is usually a bodkin among the assorted darning needles that are found in
    a large paper of assorted needles, or one can be purchased at any large store.
    One might be made at home in an emergency by breaking off the point of a
    heavy darning needle and filing off the rough edge. A bodkin is used for
    turning tailored loops.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <h4>Emery bag for
    smoothing
needles</h4>
  <p>  An emery bag is helpful if the hands perspire. It smoothes sticky needles
    and prevents them from rusting and even removes rust from the needles. It
    also
keeps the point sharp.</p>
  <h4 class="clear"> <img src="images/01_tracing.jpg" alt="tracing wheel" width="132" height="26" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Tracing wheel</h4>
  <p> A tracing wheel is seldom used on cloth but will be found very useful for
          duplicating pattern sections or tracing off patterns of dress sections
    when remodeling.</p>
  <h4> Tailor's chalk
    for marking </h4>
  <p>Tailors' chalk is a hard-pressed chalk that is made in small, flat squares.
    It is made in both white and colors and rubs off easily. It can be sharpened
    to a fine edge and is used for marking lines on the material. The colored
    chalk is used only for white material and then only sparingly. The white
    chalk is generally used. The paraffin marker is only used on wool as it must
    be removed with pressing and will leave an oily mark on silk.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/01_basting.jpg" alt="cardboard basting board" width="132" height="95" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Basting board
    free for the
asking</h4>
  <p>A basting board is indispensable and can be secured free of charge for the
    asking. The dry-goods merchant discards the cardboard on which all materials
    are rolled. Cotton fabrics are rolled on heavy cardboard that is eighteen
    inches long and makes an excellent board to use for basting many seams, pockets,
    points, corners and inside applications. Directions for its use will be given
    later. This board can also be used to pin the material firmly in place when
    ripping.</p>
  <h4>    <a name="pressboard" id="pressboard"></a>Pleat board free
for the asking </h4>
  <p>The long boards on which woolens are rolled make excellent boards for basting
    pleats and can be padded for pressing. A small press board to be kept on
    the sewing table can be made from one of the long, 27-inch boards that are
    discarded from the bolts of woolen materials. Pad it like the ironing board
    and lay it flat on the table. This makes an excellent board to use with small
    pressing iron, and it can be kept in the sewing drawer. It can also be slipped
    into some semi-finished sections for pressing them.</p>
  <h4>    Sleeve board for
much pressing </h4>
  <p>A sleeve board, or tailor's board, can either be made by a handy man, or
    a small one can be purchased at the department store. This board can be placed
    on top of the large ironing board or on the table but will also afford facilities
    for pressing into small places. It also raises the goods higher, and closer
    to the eye; and, with the seam raised on the sleeve board, the weight of
    the remainder of the dress rests on the table and does not draw the seam.
    The corner is also excellent for pressing darts and curved edges.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/01_jack.jpg" alt="tailor's jack&#8212;aka pressing boards" width="132" height="139" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Tailor's Jack</h4>
  <p>The dressmaker's ironing board or tailor's jack is in constant use. It is
    a large sleeve board that can easily be made at home by a handy man. This
    board placed on top of the ironing board brings the work closer to the eye
    and elevates the seam for pressing.</p>
  <p>Measurements: Top board 34 inches long or longer, tapering from an eight-inch
    width at one end to three inches at the other end. The base board can be
    made six inches wide and about 24 inches long. These two boards are joined
    together with a 2x4 nine inches long. The narrow end of the top board extends
    farther from the 2x4 than the wide end. Pad the top of the board and use
    for pressing. The narrow end makes an excellent rest for an inverted iron
    when pressing velvet.</p>
  <h4>    Needle board
for velvets </h4>
  <p>A needle board is practical only for the professional dressmaker as it is
    very expensive. It is a special board made of blunt needles and it is used
    for pressing all napped materials and velvets. If a needle board is not available,
    place the inverted pressing iron on the end of the sleeve board and draw
    the seams over the iron rather than pressing them flat. (See &quot;pressing.&quot;)
    (Address of needle board manufacturer will be given upon request.)</p>
  <h4>    Cutting table; a flat hard surface </h4>
  <p>It is always advisable to cut out material on a hard flat surface. If a
    large table is not available it is advisable to cut out on the floor rather
    than to cut on a bed. A sheet should first be placed on the floor to keep
    the material clean. Card tables placed close together make an excellent cutting
    surface and are just the right height if one wishes to sit when cutting.
    The card table makes an excellent work table after the dress is cut. It can
    stand beside the sewing machine and chair with the small iron and press board
    on it and will be ready for many kinds of sewing work.</p>
  <h4>    Sewing machine
that stitches well </h4>
  <p>Beautiful dresses can be made by hand but sewing on a machine that stitches
    well is much easier and quicker. The treadle machine will sew as well as
    the electric machine, but of course the electric operates without the effort
    of treading. There are many styles and makes of electric machines even to
    the small portable type. It will do all that the larger machine will do and
    can be carried to the most convenient place for sewing. There is not much
    actual machine-stitching on a dress, but there is some stitching throughout
    the construction.</p>
  <h4>    Oil frequently </h4>
  <p>The sewing machine should be given a &quot;drink&quot; of oil quite often.
    Many abused sewing machines are blamed for poor running when it is the operators
    who have neglected them and allowed them to become gummed. If it runs hard,
    oil well with kerosene and run until it runs freely. Then oil with a good
    grade of <strong>sewing machine oil</strong>, and not a household utility oil, as it is too
    heavy.</p>
  <h4>    Long mirror to
    secure the&quot;
Effect&quot; </h4>
  <p>A long mirror is a convenience. It should be placed where the light will
    fall on the figure in front of the mirror. Direct sunlight is not advisable.
    If a long mirror is not available, a small wall mirror can be placed on the
    floor at a tilted angle to secure the effect of the lower edge of the skirt.
    A hand mirror should also be used to see the effect of the back of the garment.</p>
  <h4>    Chest of drawers
for supplies </h4>
  <p>Reserve a special place for sewing materials. If an extra drawer or set
    of drawers is not available use several boxes labeled at the ends. It is
    helpful to use several small boxes, such as candy boxes, for separate supplies&#8212;silk
    thread, cotton thread, darning thread, snaps and hooks, cards of buttons,
    assorted buttons, bias seam bindings and tapes. All these small boxes can
    be kept in one large box. These time-saving hints will make sewing more interesting
    because time will not be wasted in finding certain supplies.</p>
  <h4>    Old patterns </h4>
  <p>If old patterns are saved, tie each complete pattern in its own envelope
    with a selvage for a string. This piece of the material will identify the
    pattern, and it will not be necessary to open all the patterns for identification.</p>
  <h4>    Scraps </h4>
  <p>When the dress is finished, carefully flatten out all the scraps to be saved
    and roll them into a small roll and tie with the material. This will keep
    the material flat and it will be ready for use if needed later for remodeling.</p>
  <h4>    Press cloths </h4>
  <p>Use a well worn piece of thin white cotton material for pressing if available.
    Otherwise purchase two yards of cheese cloth and fold double for pressing.
    This will suffice for all materials but heavy woolens as a great amount of
    moisture is never needed. There should be a second thin piece of cloth that
    is kept dry for pressing. Two press cloths and either a sponge or a wet wash
    rag is necessary. Dry them out when the sewing day is over. They should not
    remain wet and should be laundered often.</p>
  <h4>    For pressing
wool </h4>
  <p>A piece of flannel is excellent for placing over the press board when pressing
    wool. The right side of the wool is placed face down on the flannel. This
    will prevent the surface from becoming shiny, and is excellent for pressing
    napped woolens.</p>

  <h3><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><a name="practice" id="practice"></a></i></font></b>SEWING MACHINE PRACTICE</h3>
  <h4>    Machine threading </h4>
  <p>Learn to sew correctly on the sewing machine before attempting to make a
    dress. The tensions should be perfectly adjusted and the machine should be
    threaded correctly before it will stitch perfectly. After it has been threaded,
    drop the needle into the bobbin section, holding the end of the top thread.
    Then pull out the bobbin thread and draw both threads to the back <strong>under</strong> the
    presser foot. This will start the stitch perfectly and will prevent the threads
    from being caught into the first stitches.</p>
  <h4>    Starting and
    stopping the
sewing machine </h4>
  <p>If the machine is of the treadle type, place both feet on the treadle, one
    foot higher than the other, and practice working the machine until an even
    motion is secured. The thread should be removed from the needle for this
    practice. Be sure to start the machine to run either forward or backward
    as the machine is to be made run; usually on the treadle machine start the
    wheel with the hand. The electric machine is made to start in one direction
    but the treadle machine may run backward. It is necessary to also stop the
    wheel with the hand on the treadle machine.</p>
  <p>If the machine is electric, practice with the knee or foot control until
    the right touch is acquired to start and stop machine smoothly and not to
    run it too fast. The pressure of the foot or knee controls the speed.</p>
  <h4>    How needles are
blunted </h4>
  <p>Learn to stitch straight by following the stripe on striped material. Do
    not pull the goods at the back as this may draw the goods too rapidly and
    pull the point of the needle backward and it will strike the plate and be
    blunted. It will then draw the threads when stitching on fine materials and
    may produce a poor stitch.</p>
  <h4>    Practice
stitching curves </h4>
  <p>After the straight line can be followed, practice following curves. Mark
    on a sheet of paper curves inside of curves in one continuous line. Stitch
    the paper on these lines.</p>
  <h4>    Stitch squares
    with needle as
a point </h4>
  <p>Then mark squares on paper and learn to stitch to the points of the squares.
    When the point is reached, stop the machine with the needle DOWN into the
    point, then lift the needle bar and turn the goods. Drop the bar and continue
    with the stitching. All points are stitched in this manner.</p>
  <h4>    Holding goods,
gauging </h4>
  <p>Learn to stitch seams together, using plain materials with no lines and
    guide the stitching with the eye. In this case watch the distance between
    the cut edge and the edge of the presser foot and not the needle. Do not
    try to sew fast. One can hold the goods at the back to help hold it straight
    but the goods must not be drawn backward. The machine must feed the goods.</p>
  <h4>    Long threads unnecessary </h4>
  <p>The larger part of the material should be held to the left of the needle
    with the seam under the arm of the machine. There are few exceptions to this
    rule. Always stop the needle with the take-up thread bar (at the left of
    the machine) raised high on the machine. If this bar is down, even if the
    needle is raised, the needle will be unthreaded when the bar lifts. If this
    bar is watched, it will not be necessary to draw out yards of surplus thread
    to waste when sewing. These long threads are inconvenient and are not necessary.</p>
  <h4>    Stitch curves </h4>
  <p>Practice machine-stitching the inner edges of curves cut from material.
    Neck lines and armholes are stretched easily when tried on without the sleeves
    and the neck finish. Therefore the raw edge of loosely woven material should
    be machine-stitched even if the goods is heavy; coarse unbleached muslin
    or loosely woven wool will stretch as badly as voile under these conditions.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/01_stretch_curve.jpg" alt="showing how to ease in a stretched curve" width="132" height="63" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Easing in a
stretched curve</h4>
  <p>For an example, cut out a circle and follow the edge in stitching, sewing
    as near to the cut edge as possible. Then cut a second piece of material
    and cut a large half circle for a neck and stretch it straight so as to stretch
    the curve. It can be drawn back to shape with stitching as is often necessary
    when a neck or armhole has been stretched.</p>
  <p>Place the stretched curve on the machine and start to stitch on the end
    of the curve. Follow a line with the eye along the straight thread of material
    from the needle outward. Hold the left hand firmly on this place about six
    inches from the needle. Then follow a straight thread of the goods from the
    finger to the right. This will make a right angle (see illustration). Draw
    the material straight along this line and start to stitch around the curve.
    Stitch for two or three inches, keeping the straight threads at right angles.
    Then shift the fingers, following another set of straight threads, and stitch
    another few inches. Allow the material to ease back into its natural position
    as it stitches, which it will do without any assistance. When the circle
    is completed it will lie flat and will not be rippled around the stretched
    curve.</p>
  <h4>    Stretched bias straightened </h4>
  <p>When finished edges do not meet at the end of the seam the seam should be
    ripped, and each seam can be tested by stitching in the same manner. One
    side may have been stretched when basted and this can easily be determined,
    if the bias edge is stitched.</p>
  <p>Pin or hold the goods on a flat surface at a right angle, smoothing the
    goods along the lengthwise and crosswise thread of the goods to make a right
    angle. If the bias edge has been stretched it will ripple and should be opened
    and re-basted.</p>
  <p>When two bias edges are to be finished separately and must meet (an opening
    on a bias yoke), test them for meeting when they are basted rather than waiting
    until they are stitched. If a bias edge is stretched, it will always twist.
    It must be opened and straightened.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/01_speed.jpg" alt="stitching continuous seams" width="132" height="94" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Speed in
stitching seams</h4>
  <p>Practice continuous stitching for speed in construction. As one seam is
    finished have another one ready to start under the needle. After the second
    seam has been stitched for six inches reach back and cut the seams apart.
    This will save much time and possibly re-threading of the needle if many
    seams are stitched at one time.</p>
  <h4>    Finger safety </h4>
  <p>Keep the fingers well removed from the needle. If the finger gets under
    the needle it will surely be pierced. Usually every one must run a needle
    through the finger once but that is all that is necessary to teach the lesson.</p>
  <h4>    Tension adjustment
Dropped stitch </h4>
  <p>If the machine does not stitch correctly it is usually some poor adjustment
    of the tensions. There is a tension for the upper thread and one for the
    bobbin. The stitch should sink into the goods on each side. If one thread
    seems to be on top of the goods, then the other thread is too loose and the
    tension should be tightened. There should be a book of directions for tensions
    with every sewing machine; if not, turn the tension to the right to tighten
    and to the left to loosen either for the screw on the top or on the bobbin
    case. A partial turn of the screw is usually all that is necessary. Try the
    stitch on a sample of cloth until the right stitch is secured. Even drop
    stitches are sometimes caused by loose tensions or possibly by a short needle.</p>
  <h4>    Oiling the
machine </h4>
  <p>Be sure to keep the machine well oiled. It should be oiled at the end of
    a hard day's sewing and a piece of cloth left under the needle to absorb
    any surplus oil. Before again sewing on the machine after oiling it, be sure
    to wipe off the machine <strong>under</strong> the side-arm above the needle. Draw a rag across
    under and above the needle as this is the place that holds that drop of oil
    that may fall on the material when sewing and may not only cause a grease
    spot but a black streak also.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/01_straighten.jpg" alt="pressing seam" width="132" height="138" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Straighten the stitching line
by pressing</h4>
  <p>After the seam has been basted and is ready to stitch it will require but
    a few moments of time to straighten all the sewing lines and perfect them
    for straight stitching.</p>
  <p>Press each seam over to one side (do not open) and make a crease on one
    side of the seam on all seams that are not curved. Hip seams are straight
    from the hips downward but are curved from the hips to the waist. Lift the
    pressed seams and the crease will be the line to follow in preference to
    the basting. Stitch on the crease and the line will be true and straight.</p>
  <p>This pressing not only perfects the seam but gives an encouraging appearance
    to the dress. It is more interesting to sew when it LOOKS RIGHT.</p>
<p>Make samples of each problem step by step as instructions are given.</p>

  <h3><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><a name="material" id="material"></a></i></font></b>MATERIAL TERMS IN REFERENCE TO PATTERNS</h3>
  <h4>    Material terms </h4>
  <p>The terms for materials in reference to the use of patterns are, &quot;Selvage&quot;, &quot;Lengthwise
    thread&quot;, &quot;Crosswise thread&quot;, &quot; Bias&quot;, and &quot;Fold&quot;.</p>
  <h4>    Selvage at
the edge </h4>
  <p>The selvage of the goods is the finished edge down the length of the material
    and is usually a different weave than the material itself, especially in
    novelty weaves and wool. The threads are often woven closer together even
    on silk, and in wool the selvage is often made with cotton threads which
    make it shrink differently than the woolen goods. This makes it advisable
    to always remove the selvage from wool. It is not necessary to remove it
    from silk, cotton, or linen.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/01_lengthwise.jpg" alt="how to find the lengthwise thread" width="132" height="144" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Lengthwise
thread</h4>
  <p>It is most important to recognize the &quot;lengthwise&quot; thread of the
    goods as all patterns are marked or printed, indicating the &quot;lengthwise
    thread&quot; which shows <strong>how</strong> the pattern is to be placed on the material.
    The pattern should be placed <strong>exactly</strong> as this mark indicates.</p>
  <p>The lengthwise thread runs parallel with the selvage on all parts of the
    cloth. Even if the selvage is removed, there is still a &quot;lengthwise&quot; thread.
    This is important as many confuse the term &quot;straight of material&quot; or
    a &quot;straight piece of goods&quot; with the true &quot;lengthwise.&quot; When
    a section is cut square, all four sides are &quot;straight&quot; but only
    two of the sides will be on the &quot;lengthwise&quot;; the other two edges
    will be on the &quot;<strong>crosswise</strong>&quot;. To confuse these two terms may ruin
    the garment.</p>
<h3 class="clear">    <img src="images/01_crosswise.jpg" alt="How to find the crosswise thread" width="132" height="66" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Crosswise thread</h3>
<p>The &quot;crosswise&quot; thread runs across the material along a torn edge
    which would also make it a &quot;straight&quot; line, but this line should
    not be used for a &quot;lengthwise&quot; when placing the pattern, as the &quot;crosswise
    thread&quot; has an elasticity that often causes the material to twist and
have an ungraceful line when on the figure.</p>
<h4>  Cutting
lengthwise </h4>
  <p>Unless otherwise designated, cut all center fronts and backs, both of the
    waist and skirt, on the lengthwise thread of the goods. The lengthwise hangs
    in more graceful lines than does the crosswise, which makes it necessary
    to cut material with the lengthwise thread running <strong>down</strong> the center of sleeves
    and drapes. Belts should always be cut on the lengthwise thread.</p>
  <h4>    Cutting
crosswise </h4>
  <p>Gathers are usually placed along the crosswise thread so that the folds
    of the gathers will drop along the lengthwise thread.</p>
  <h4>    To determine
the lengthwise </h4>
  <p>It is often difficult to determine the correct &quot;lengthwise thread&quot; after
    the selvage has been removed, especially on an odd-shaped piece of goods.
    To determine the lengthwise, lay the goods in a few pleats in the hands,
    first across one straight edge and then the other. Note which one is more
    graceful. One set of pleats will be stiff and wiry while the other will fall
    in graceful lines. The latter will be found to have the lengthwise threads
    running down the pleats. Chalk-mark this line for future reference when cutting.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/01_bias.jpg" alt="Finding the bias along the diagonal" width="132" height="142" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Bias in
diagonal</h4>
  <p>The &quot;bias&quot; of the material is the diagonal section running either
    to the right or left. A &quot;true&quot; bias is the diagonal of a perfect
    square, such as a folded handkerchief as it is folded from point to point.
    All other bias is termed &quot;near bias&quot; or &quot;long bias&quot;.
    This is seldom used. When bias is mentioned, it should always be out on the
    true bias even though several shorter strips must be sewed together. The
    results are much better. Making bias strips is easy when the right method
    is used.</p>
  <h4>    Cutting bias </h4>
  <p>To cut a true bias from an uneven piece of material, which is usually necessary,
    draw a chalk line along one straight thread for three or four inches, at
    a corner of the goods. Then mark another line across the other straight thread,
    making the two lines meet at a point. Then mark on each line at three inches
    and chalk mark a line joining these two marks, which will then make a triangle.
    This last line will be the &quot;true&quot; bias of the material. Mark off
    the bias from this line.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/01_fold.jpg" alt="the fold line of the fabric" width="129" height="162" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Fold of material</h4>
  <p>The &quot;fold&quot; designates a folded line of a double fold of material
    as it will be folded in reference to the pattern and <strong>not</strong> as it folded on
    the bolt in the store. For example; the back of the waist is usually made
    the same on both the right and left sides of the back, therefore the pattern
    of the back is usually made in a half pattern and the goods must be cut double.
    In the pattern layout this half section is shown laid to cut on a fold of
    the material, and it is important to place your pattern piece as shown in
    the layout, so that the cut fabric will be twice the size of the pattern
    piece.</p>
  <h4>    Beginner's
choice </h4>
  <p>The beginner's first mistake is often in selecting a pattern that is too
    complicated and material that is hard to handle. It is wise to select for
    the first garment a pattern that has only a few pieces or one that is marked
    especially for beginners. Beginners' patterns are so designed that they can
    be cut and put together easily, even if they have a good many pieces. In
    order to assure satisfactory results, one of the fabrics recommended on the
    pattern envelope should be selected.</p>
  <h4>    The first dress </h4>
  <p>The first dress should be made of a firmly-woven material of a small print;
    it should not stretch and should be easily pressed. If silk is desired, it
    should be a figured piece that does not spot and should be firmly woven,
    as many seams may have to be ripped unless samples are made of each problem.
    The figured material is an advantage as mistakes are not so apparent in printed
    goods as in plain. There may be many mistakes in the first dress, but this
    is not necessary if the sewing problems are mastered before the dress is
    made.</p>
  <p>Thin or loosely-woven material should be avoided by the beginner, as should
    the large floral, plain and striped patterns. Velvets and satins should not
    be attempted until one is able to sew other materials perfectly. Soft wool
    is not so difficult if the pressing rules are followed, but wool must be
    tailored perfectly to secure the best results.</p>
  <h4>    Gingham </h4>
  <p>Gingham offers encouragement to the beginner. It is reversible, which is
    an advantage as there is no right or wrong side. It is firmly woven and retains
    a crease; there is no up and down and the pattern can be turned without miscutting.
    It is easy to cut and does not slip. It should be selected in a small print
    and not in a stripe.</p>
  <h4>    Reversibles </h4>
  <p>Materials that are reversible are often easier to use than those having
    a wrong side. They can be turned and can thus be utilized to better advantage.</p>
  <h4>    Examine </h4>
  <p>Material should be carefully examined before cutting. Remnants often have
    flaws which can be marked with a pin and can often be avoided in the cutting.
    Study the material to determine if it has a right and wrong side; an up and
    down; nap or pile; large floral pattern, or wide stripes or plaids. These
    factors all must be taken into consideration when cutting and making.</p>

  <h3><b><a name="choose" id="choose"></a></b>HOW TO CHOOSE PATTERNS</h3>
  <h4> Choose patterns intelligently </h4>
  <p>Choosing the right pattern requires much thought. The pattern must not only
    be suitable to the material but it must also be suitable to the individual
    who is to wears the finished garment. The question to keep in mind is not &quot;Is
    that dress attractive?&quot; but rather &quot;Will I be attractive in that
    dress?&quot;</p>
  <p>Most women wish to appear like the &quot;picture&quot;, a model figure.
    Women flock to fashion shows to see the <strong>model figures</strong> display the gowns that
    they later will make or buy, in hopes that they, too, will make the same
    appearance. But-all styles suitable to a &quot;perfect 36&quot; figure may
    not be becoming to your figure. Are you aware of any peculiarities of your
    figure that should be minimized? Are your hips extra large? Are you quite
    short and stout? Are your arms quite large for your body? Have you a large
    abdomen? Are you very tall and thin? Are your shoulders stooped? Is your
    figure angular? Each figure should thus be analyzed to check the selection
    of patterns so as to choose becoming styles&#8212;those that will enhance
    the attractiveness of the wearer, and not merely advertise the pattern of
    the dress.</p>
  <h4>    Visualize </h4>
  <p>Many women cannot visualize themselves in a new dress before it is made.
    This is an art that every home sewer should study, for without proper selection,
    the dress will not be satisfactory even though the sewing is a work of art.</p>
  <p>You have a dress or possibly several dresses that you or your loved ones
    especially like. Study their lines, discover their secret. And&#8212;DO NOT
    IGNORE THE ADVICE OF YOUR FRIENDS. We can never &quot;see ourselves as others
    see us&quot;. This is a tragedy for many women. If they could see themselves
    as others see them they would often not select the clothes that they wear.</p>
  <p>Stand in front of a long mirror; view yourself from all sides, especially
    the side lines. Use a hand mirror. Stand at a distance, not close to the
    glass, and notice the outlines of the figure. Then notice how much smaller
    you appear in a dark dress than in a light dress. Drape a cloth around the
    shoulders and notice how much larger the figure appears. Try different effects
    with light and dark cloth for fronts, trimmings for collars and drapes until
    you find out what is most suited to your figure before selecting a pattern
    of similar design. If you learn to study your figure, it will soon be much
    more encouraging to make your own clothes, for they will be so much more
    attractive and becoming.</p>
<h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/01_illusion.jpg" alt="optical illusion of two lines the same length" width="132" height="114" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Optical illusions</h4>
<p>The lines of dress designs produce optical illusions that either make the
    dress becoming or unbecoming to the wearer. The garment may be beautiful
    on a model figure but when worn by one who is out of proportion, the illusion
    of the lines produces effects that are not pleasing and are often very unbecoming.</p>
  <p>Notice the lines to the left. Both long lines are the same length, and both
    have lines added that are also of the same length. Note the different effects.
    The line with the long straight lines added in a lengthening design makes
    the center line appear much longer than the line with short lines placed
    inward. One appears long and slender, while the other appears short and thick.</p>
  <p>Dress lines produce the same effects. Lines in the dress made in seams running
    perpendicular to the floor will produce a slenderizing effect while large,
    round, floral designs in materials; or circular effects in capes; large,
    loose sleeves, crosswise lines in the design; or any lines that attract the
    eye from the length of the figure will broaden it to the same degree. Crosswise
    lines shorten the figure, while an unbroken line lengthens the figure.</p>
  <h4>    Suggestions </h4>
  <p>Here are a few suggestions for those who desire to choose patterns wisely:</p>
  <p>A normal size figure has a wider choice than one that is out of proportion,
    or is very small, or very large.</p>
  <p>If you are large do not select a pattern unless it has slenderizing lines
    in vertical sections. The front should not be made in one plain piece, but
    will be more slenderizing if the pattern is designed with long collar lines
    in the front, or a deep yoke section possibly edged with a fold or collar.
    The deep, graceful folds of a cowl neck are also becoming and afford a variation
    from the standard surplus lines so often used.</p>
  <p>Sleeves for a large woman should be made below the elbow and if they are
    full, they should be made of soft clinging material. Large cape effects,
    so often chosen by the large woman because there is no sleeve problem to
    contend with, may be comfortable but enlarges the figure to a marked degree.
    Look in the mirror at the width of the shoulders when wearing one of the
    cape sleeve dresses and be convinced.</p>
  <h4>    Large hips </h4>
  <p>If the hips are large, seek to slenderize them not only in selecting the
    vertical lines in the design but also in making the waist a trifle looser
    and fuller with the addition of a cape collar or drop shoulders to widen
    the effect of the body so that the width of the hips will not be so much
    greater than the width of the shoulders.</p>
  <h4>    Top heavy </h4>
  <p>The woman with larger bust than hips should be especially cautious in selecting
    patterns. Her waist should be as plain as possible, with the vertical lines
    in the designs or the soft folds of the cowl neck. The V-neck should be used
    by the larger woman as the higher necks have a tendency to broaden the chest
    lines and enlarge the figure.</p>
<h4>Angular figures </h4>
  <p>The tall, angular figure should seek to broaden the effect of her clothes.
    They may fit as perfectly as her larger sister's dresses, but should be of
    the full, soft lines about the shoulders and neck. Even the front of the
    dress may be made in the softer lines, with the long, soft collar effects.
    This type of figure can also wear the tiered skirts, the peplums, the big
    sashes and bows at the waist. She should avoid the skirts with the long,
    tight lines that would emphasize her thinness.</p>
  <h4>    Short figures </h4>
  <p>The very short woman, especially if she is of the matronly type, should
    avoid all belt lines in the front of the dress and should select length of
    line from the top of the dress to the hem in an unbroken line, especially
    in front. The belt may be placed across the back, but should end at the sides.
    There are many patterns with the skirt extending up into the waist that could
    be made beltless and would be very becoming for the short, stout woman.</p>
  <h4>    Stout figures </h4>
  <p>The stout woman should avoid the appearance of being too large for her clothes.
    The youthful styles should be left for the youthful figures. There are many
    becoming styles for the stout woman without making the figure conspicuous.
    The fronts, neck lines, lack of fullness in the skirt, good corseting, ease
    in fitting, all have a tendency to slenderize her figure. These should be
    desired rather than a pretty dress pattern that is attractive on the figure
    in the picture. Keep in mind, &quot;Will I look attractive in that dress?&quot;</p>
  <h4>    Flat chest </h4>
  <p>The figure with the flat chest should seek to make the dress with fuller
    lines across the chest. This can be accomplished by selecting patterns with
    draped effects or bows at the neck or the chest line. Tucks on the shoulder
    also fill the chest line. This type of figure should never make a dress close
    fitting through the chest with no trimming to relieve the flatness.</p>
<h4>Selection </h4>
  <p>The following are some of the questions that should be answered before the
    pattern is purchased:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>  Is the skirt too short for your figure? Short skirts make the figure
      appear shorter and broader.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li> Is a defined waist line becoming? A belt draws the eye to the width
      of the body and also shortens the short figure.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li> Can you wear the natural (or lower) waist line? The natural waist line
      emphasizes the prominence of the sway back and any indication of a prominence
      of the abdomen.
    The waist line should be lowered.<br />
    <br />
    </li>
    <li> Can you wear full sleeves, elbow length? The elbow strikes the body
      at the waist line. Fullness at the waist line will make the waist line
      appear larger
    if short full sleeves are worn.<br />
    <br />
    </li>
    <li> Can you wear stripes? Wide stripes attract attention to a large figure.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li> Has the dress a large collar? Large collars make the shoulders and
      arms appear larger and the figure broader.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li> Can you wear a division line in the skirt, as in over skirts, peplums,
      ruffles or tiers? Horizontal lines have a tendency to shorten the figure.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li> If you are flat-chested, have you selected a dress with fullness through
    the front? The chest should be filled out to a normal proportion.<br />
    <br />
    </li>
    <li> Can you wear a round neck? Round effects near the face make the face
      rounder.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li> Can you wear a collar at the back? Short necks should avoid any collar
    effect in the back as it shortens the neck.<br />
    <br />
    </li>
    <li> Is the skirt long and tight? Long tight skirts cannot be worn by women
    with full thighs. The skirt will burst in the seams.<br />
    <br />
    </li>
    <li> Is the dress sleeveless&#8212;can you wear sleeveless dresses? Large
    arms are not attractive in sleeveless dresses; the flat upper part of the
    arm should
    be covered.<br />
    <br />
    </li>
    <li> If the abdomen is large, have you selected a dress with looseness
      at the waist so that it will drop in folds when seated? Soft long collars,
      surplus
    effects or even gathers at the waist line give this needed softness across
    the abdomen when seated.<br />
    <br />
    </li>
    <li> If the neck is long, have you selected a dress with a collar? A long
    neck will be shortened by the use of many of the collar effects.</li>

  <h4>    Dress patterns </h4>
  <p>Dress patterns are made to fill the needs of women who desire to make a
    dress that has been previously designed and who desire the pattern of each
    section for cutting, together with the instructions as to the assembling
    of the garment.</p>
<h4>Pattern symbols </h4>
  <p>Marks for joining the various sections of the pattern are often made in
    symbols, each pattern manufacturer using a different type of symbol, while
    some patterns have the printed words for the instructions. Many of the patterns
    indicate the joining of the sections with notches, either cut in the paper
    or printed.</p>
  <h4>    Seams allowance </h4>
  <p>The seam allowances on the different makes of patterns also differ, which
    makes it quite necessary to understand the pattern before cutting. Otherwise,
    if you <strong>assume</strong> that there is a certain width seam allowed, and a wider seam
    is made on that particular pattern, then the dress may be sewed according
    to the narrower seams and it will be too large, which will not be the fault
    of the pattern. This accounts for some patterns &quot;running large&quot;.
    For this reason, together with many others, it is advisable to actually mark
    the sewing line on the material so that the dress will be made uniform.</p>
  <h4>    Wider seams </h4>
  <p>The majority of patterns allow a three-eighths to half inch seam allowance.
    But, if you are not sure that the pattern is a perfect fit for you, or if
    your material is of a sort that frays easily, it may be wise for you to cut
    a wider seam than the pattern allows, but be sure to mark the sewing line
    by the rules given later.</p>
  <p>Some patterns have wider seams than others. If your pattern does not provide
    an extra wide seam, it will be advisable to cut well beyond the edge of the
    pattern on the side seams. But be sure to keep in mind that the basting for
    the first trying on should be made along the sewing line indicated by the
    make of pattern you are using. Side seams should also be made wider as a &quot;<strong>let
    out</strong>&quot; when fitting. This will be explained in the lessons on &quot;<strong>fitting</strong>&quot;.
    Finished seams are also pressed open and it is almost impossible to press
    open such a small seam. The wider seam can be handled to better advantage
    and can be trimmed off later if so desired, or it may be needed in a seam
    finish.</p>
  <h4>    Lengthwise
thread </h4>
  <p>All patterns, whether printed or marked in symbols, all indicate the &quot;<strong>lengthwise
    thread of the material</strong>.&quot; This indication on each section of the pattern
    shows just how the pattern is to be laid onto the goods.</p>
  <p>The importance of this symbol is often minimized and some section of the
    pattern is twisted into a convenient corner to <strong>save</strong> the material. The &quot;lengthwise
    thread&quot; is sometimes taken for the &quot;crosswise thread&quot; and
    the whole dress may be ruined through ignorance. Many &quot;home made&quot; effects
    can be traced to a poor cutting of the pattern, for the dress will not hang
    gracefully if it is cut wrong and the mistake will be quickly noticed, not
    only by those who know how to sew but by others who know that the dress &quot;does
    not look right.&quot;</p>
  <h4>    Layout </h4>
  <p>Most patterns include a chart showing how to place the pattern on the goods.
    Some makes give a layout for each size, laid on materials of various widths
    with and without a distinct up and down. When a pattern offers such a complete
    cutting service, it is not wise to buy less material than the pattern envelope
    specifies&#8212;unless you are very much shorter than the average for your
    size. If a pattern provides only a sample layout, showing only one size laid
    on material with a distinct up and down, you may be able to do with less
    than the amount of fabric specified, provided your fabric has no up and down.
    However, it is never wise&#8212;particularly for the inexperienced sewer&#8212;to
    risk running short of material.</p>
  <h4>    Darts </h4>
  <p>Darts are often found in the pattern in the front of the waist, either at
    the under-arm seams, or at the shoulder. The back of the skirt may have darts
    at the waist, and the sleeve may have darts at the elbow. Darts are also
    used for trimming, such as to draw up fullness in the sleeve cap of a puff
    sleeve. Darts should be marked carefully and followed as given.</p>
  <p>Darts are important and are indicated in symbols or with printed lines that
    converge to form a point. This indicates the width of material that must
    be taken up in a V-shaped section to <strong>raise</strong> the goods at the seam to fit the
    curve of the figure. If any darts are indicated in the pattern it is necessary
    to make them in the dress. Do not attempt to stretch out the goods and cut
    off the dart. The effect will not be correct.</p>
  <h4>    Pleats </h4>
  <p>The lines of the folds of pleats are also indicated in the pattern. It will
    be advisable to mark the folds of the pleats along the lines or symbols given.
    There is a simple and quick method given in the lesson on Pleats. A perfectly
    made pleated skirt is a work of art. Do not guess at the pleats and put them
    in by &quot;guess&quot; ; the finished garment will surely advertise the
    fact.</p>
  <h4>    Press the
pattern </h4>
  <p>The iron will be used continuously while sewing; therefore, press the pattern
    sections before laying them onto the goods. The few moments' time spent will
    be well repaid in the ease and perfection with which you can work with the
    pattern pressed flat.</p>
  <h4>    Match the
sections </h4>
  <p>It will be much easier to make the garment if all the sections of the pattern
    are assembled and fully understood before the dress is cut. Match all the
    front sections, then all the back sections of both the waist and skirt; then
    match any sleeve sections. If the sleeve is an intricate cut, fold it together;
    pleat it up and pin on the cuff or any inlets, so that it will be understood
    fully. If the pattern is not thoroughly understood the garment might be miscut.</p>
  <h4>    Lay aside all unnecessary
sections </h4>
  <p>Many patterns offer more than one style of sleeves, front, or trimming,
    some of which will not be used. Lay aside any sections of the pattern that
    will not be used, also any sections that will be used for different material
    for trimming. Fold up all the unnecessary sections and place them in the
    envelope so as not to confuse them with the used sections.</p>
  <h4>    Check the
    pattern for
fitting </h4>
  <p>All patterns should be checked for fitting before they are cut. The patterns
    are made to fit the standard figure and if the individual figure does not
    conform to standard measurements, then it will be necessary to alter the
    pattern at this time. If the measurements are larger, then allowance must
    be made when cutting. Rules for fitting will be found in the <a href="hsc-7.html">lesson
    on fitting</a>.</p>
  <h4>    Examine the
goods </h4>
  <p>Examine the goods before cutting. Determine if it has any flaws. If there
    is a flaw, place a pin at this point and it can usually be avoided when cutting.
    Also determine if it had an up and down, or has any stripes to match. All
    this must be planned when laying out the pattern.</p>
  <h4>    Preparation </h4>
  <p>Wool material should be preshrunk and the selvage removed before placing
    the pattern. Cotton goods should also be shrunk unless Sanforized. The crosswise
    edge must be straight on all materials to be cut folded double; tear off
    a strip if possible or chalk-mark a line on wool. Pin the crosswise threads
    at the top if the goods is to be folded double, or measure back from the
    selvage both at the top and bottom, measuring from the lengthwise mark on
    the pattern section if the material is opened for cutting. The pattern must
    be placed correctly according to the &quot;lengthwise&quot; symbols.</p>
  <h4>    Material with
stiff dressing </h4>
  <p>Material such as prints may not fold double even if torn at the edge. If
    the goods does not lie flat when doubled after the edge has been torn, stretch
    it diagonally to straighten the edges.</p>
  <h4>    Trial layout </h4>
  <p>Take time to lay out the pattern in a trial layout. Place all the sections
    loosely on the goods so as to test the amount of material. Do not pin the
    pattern down for the trial layout. Roll up the goods as the material is covered
    with the pattern.</p>
  <h4>    Place all the
pattern </h4>
  <p>It is not advisable to cut thoughtlessly. Never cut one piece of pattern
    until all the pattern has been laid out, or at least tried out. If you cut
    too quick, you may find that the material is too short or too small for some
    important section. When there are large sections of the material remaining,
    it is usually evident that the pattern might have been shifted and been cut
    to better advantage or the pattern might have been adapted to the material,
    making a seamed yoke effect if necessary.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">Cut double
    patterns</h4>
  <p>If there are two sections to be cut with <img src="images/01_double_b.jpg" alt="how crosswise thread can become crooked when folding fabric" width="132" height="160" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />only <img src="images/01_double_a.jpg" alt="cutting on the fold" width="132" height="166" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />one pattern, such as two sleeves
    cut from different parts of the goods, it is advisable to cut the second
    pattern to use on the trial layout. The same is true of double collars and
    cuffs or wide facings for revers. The back may even require a matching section
    if it is not to be cut on a fold. After the first sleeve is cut, the material
    will be turned over and the original pattern, with the first sleeve pinned
    to it, will be placed onto the second sleeve and both sleeves will be pinned
    to the one pattern for cutting.</p>
  <p>When cutting from a fold, with a half pattern, such as cutting the back
    or front, measure the width of the widest part of the pattern and then fold
    the material over to this width, measuring back from the selvage to the upper
    and lower end of the mark for the &quot;lengthwise&quot; of material. This
    will place the pattern with the lengthwise thread correctly on both sections.</p>
  <p>It is also necessary to match the straight crosswise thread of the material
    when the goods is folded, or one side of the section will be cut correctly
    and the other side will be crooked. If the goods cannot be torn across the
    top, be sure to chalk-mark along the straight crosswise thread and then match
    the line when folding the goods double and pin across the top.</p>
  <h4>Piecing </h4>
  <p>It is often possible to piece several of the facings and even an inconspicuous
    corner of the under-arm or the sleeve if necessary. If material is to be
    pieced, be sure to match the same thread of the goods; match the edge perfectly,
    often with right side basting, and then press the seam open and re-cut the
    material to match the pattern perfectly. &quot;Guessing&quot; at sewing results
    never produces perfect work.</p>
  <h4>    Belts </h4>
  <p>A belt should be cut on the length of the material, and it should be planned
    when the other sections of the garment are cut. If it is left to the last
    it is usually necessary to either piece it or to cut it on the crosswise
    thread, which is incorrect. If it is necessary to piece it, place the piecing
    at the under-arm seams where it will be the least conspicuous.</p>
  <h4>    Large surface
for layout </h4>
  <p>If a large cutting surface is not available, lay out the material on the
    floor, placing all the sections of the pattern according to the layout, if
    the pattern has not been altered and all the pattern is to be used. If the
    pattern sections have been changed so that they can be cut to better advantage,
    then lay out the pattern as economically as possible.</p>
  <h4>    Cutting without
layout </h4>
  <p>Place the skirt sections first with the widest part at the lower edge of
    the goods. Rest the remaining goods on a chair if cutting on a table. The
    weight of the goods is relieved and it will not slide to the floor.</p>
  <p>Fill in the remaining spaces with smaller sections of the pattern. Do not
    pin down the pattern until the best arrangement has been found. If large
    sections of the goods remain and all the pattern has not been placed, do
    not become alarmed, as it can usually be rearranged to better advantage.
    When assured that there is sufficient material, pin the pattern to place,
    measuring the lengthwise thread mark and the garment can be cut out.</p>

  <h3><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><a name="shrink" id="shrink"></a></i></font></b>SHRINKING</h3>
  <h4> Shrink cotton </h4>
  <p>All wash fabrics should be shrunk before they are made unless they are Sanforized.
    The dress can then be made to fit as closely as desired without allowing
    for shrinking. Place the folded material in cold water and allow to remain
    till thoroughly wet. Wring out and hang up to dry. Press before it is too
    dry. Be sure that the edges are pressed straight and the material folds evenly.
    Tear the top edge to secure a straight line. If it cannot be made to fold
    evenly (any material) pull it diagonally to loosen the dressing and it will
    soon fold perfectly.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/01_test.jpg" alt="outline of iron faceplate" width="88" height="95" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Test wool for
shrinking</h4>
  <p>Most of the better quality of wool is now preshrunk and can be made without
    further shrinking. To test wool to determine if it has been preshrunk place
    a corner of the material on the press board, place a wet cloth over it and
    place the iron on the wet cloth several inches from the edge. Steam it well
    but do not press too dry. Lift the iron and look at the spot. If the iron
    had left an imprint with a ruffled edge around it then the material has shrunk
    where the iron was placed and has drawn it up. This goods must be shrunk,
    as all seams must be pressed with much moisture, and if the wool is not preshrunk,
    the seams will pucker.</p>
  <h4>    How to
shrink wool </h4>
  <p>Woolen material is usually 54 inches wide and is shrunk and pressed folded.
    Remove all the selvage.</p>
  <p>Wring a sheet out of warm water, folding it double the full length and place
    the wet sheet on the table. Place the folded wool on the sheet and roll the
    wool and sheet together the full length. Lay away for several hours or overnight.
    Then remove the sheet and press the wool on the wrong side as it lays double,
    without a cloth. Press first one side and then turn to the other side of
    the fold, always pressing on the wrong side of the goods. Do not press a
    crease on the fold; press up to it but not on the folded edge. Do not press
    dry, but allow it to dry thoroughly after it is pressed.</p>
  <h4>    <b><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="press" id="press"></a></font></i></b>Pressing</h4>
  <p>Wool should never be pressed dry, and if the iron is not too hot, it is
    not always necessary to use a cloth for pressing. A <strong>dry cloth</strong> is seldom used
    when pressing the shrunk wool, but a wet cloth is usually used in pressing
    when sewing. Seams of wool can be pressed open by wetting the finger tips
    and running the wet fingers down the seam. The tip of the iron can easily
    follow the seam.</p>
  <h4>    Pressing
wool damp </h4>
  <p>NEVER PRESS WOOL TOO DRY. Remove the iron while the goods is still steaming.
    If you have noticed the tailor's pressing machines in the window, this point
    will be demonstrated. If the wool is accidentally pressed until it is slick,
    place a wet cloth over this spot and repress, lifting the iron and cloth
    while the goods is still steaming. This will remove the hard surface.</p>
  <h4 class="clear">    <img src="images/01_fullness.jpg" alt="sleeve cap with fullness" width="57" height="138" hspace="5" vspace="3" align="right" />Pressing out
fullness in wool</h4>
  <p>Fullness can easily be pressed out of wool, such as the top of the sleeve
    cap of a mannish coat. The tailor presses this sleeve until it cups over
    the top of the shoulder with no gathers. Two rows of gathers are placed around
    the curve and it is then pressed over a curved surface (or the end of the
    press board), using a wet cloth. Repeat the operation until all the fullness
    disappears.</p>
  <p>The pucker at the end of darts in wool can also be completely removed with
    pressing. The dart of course must be made correctly before it is pressed,
    but the pressing will perfect the end of the dart, and make it practically
    invisible. Press with the dart on the end of the press board. Place a wet
    cloth over the end and steam press it flat.</p>
  <h4>    Press with
point of iron </h4>
  <p>When pressing open seams, press with the point of the iron, lifting the
    back so that the full weight of the iron rests in front.</p>
  <h4>Silk pressing
with moisture</h4>
  <p>Silk should not be shrunk or dipped in water before making. It is manufactured
    with a dressing which should not be removed.</p>
  <p>It is most important to press silk correctly. Many silk dresses look &quot;home
    made&quot; because they are improperly pressed. It is as important to press
    silk dresses during the process of construction as it is to press a wool
    coat. The dress will be much more perfect if it is pressed as it is being
    made. The factory operator or the expert sewer may be able to make a complete
    dress without pressing, but she is making hundreds of dresses of the same
    design and material and becomes an expert in her work. The home sewer must
    be more cautious and exert every effort to make her work perfect in the easiest
    manner. The iron certainly gives the aid needed.</p>
  <p>Silk edges should be clean cut, and it requires moisture to make this edge
    keen. Silk pressed dry will spring back into its original position and must
    be pressed flat to hold. But if moisture is used it must be used correctly
    or the seams will have a laundered appearance or it will water spot.</p>
  <p>Place the seam to be pressed on the press board wrong side up. If the seam
    is to be opened, press it dry first, then place a closely woven <strong>dry
    cloth</strong>    over the seam and lightly brush a wet cloth over the dry cloth and press.
    There will be sufficient moisture absorbed into the dry cloth to press the
    seam flat. If the seam is not clean cut on the right side, giving a finished
    appearance, repeat the operation.</p>
  <h4>    Synthetics </h4>
  <p>There are many kinds of synthetic fabrics, some of which wash beautifully
    and do not require shrinking. Some are very sensitive to heat and will stick
    to the iron if the iron is too hot. Others shrink greatly when wet but will
    stretch out to the original shape if ironed quite damp. If the garment is
    too small after washing, press it with a wet cloth and stretch the material
    as it is pressed, measuring to secure the correct size.</p>
  <h4>    Satin pressing </h4>
  <p>Satin should be pressed cautiously and should not be pressed until the seam
    is perfect. Satin retains the crease and it will be difficult to remove it;
    even the basting stitches are easily pressed into the satin.</p>
  <p>Press lightly with no moisture and then remove the bastings before the final
    pressing. Satin should be pressed from the right side, using a cheesecloth
    over the satin. If moisture is to be used for a clean-cut edge, use a heavy
    cloth over the satin and follow the direction for pressing silk.</p>
  <h4>    Pressing pleats
with paper </h4>
  <p>When pressing pleats, especially on satin or thin wool, slide a folded paper
    under the right side of the pleat before pressing. The pleat will be indented
    into the under side of the goods unless the folded paper is used.</p>
  <p>Pleated hems should be pressed over a heavily padded board with the folded
    paper.</p>
  <h4>    Velvet steaming </h4>
  <p>All velvet weaves are steamed and not pressed flat on a board. The professionals
    have needle boards, but they are too expensive for the home sewer and it
    is not always possible to use them.</p>
  <p>Many of the velvet seams can be creased open with the thumb nail. Press
    as little as possible. Seams that must be pressed are drawn over an inverted
    iron, held upside-down on the end of the sleeve board. Place a wet cloth
    on the hot iron, and draw the wrong side of the velvet seam over the steaming
    iron. As this is difficult to do, it is advisable to press as the seams are
    made and while the garment is still open. The amateur should have a tailor
    or presser give the final pressing of velvet.</p>
  <h4>    Needle board </h4>
  <p>When using the velvet board, the velvet is spread face down and pressed
    with a damp cloth placed over it to remove creases, but the transparent velvet
    cannot be dampened or pressed on a needle board.</p>
  <h4>    Water spots </h4>
  <p>Silk is often manufactured with certain sizing to hold the material firm.
    Water will remove this sizing and will leave a spot; the sizing has run to
    the outer edge of the spot. After the spot is dry, rub the goods between
    the hands and the spot will disappear. The surplus sizing has been removed
    from the edge of the spot and it is now invisible.</p>
  <h4>    Pin prick spots
removed </h4>
  <p>It often happens when sewing on light materials that the finger is pricked
    with the needle and a small spot of blood will drop onto the dress. This
    can usually be removed with care.</p>
  <p>Take two or three yards of white thread, chew them until they are wet and
    in a firm ball. Take the small ball of thread, run a pin through it to hold
    it and as the spot rests on a blotter, touch the spot, rubbing from the outer
    edge inward and the spot will usually disappear.</p>
  <h4>    <a name="spots" id="spots"></a>Oil spots
removed </h4>
  <p>A clean drop of sewing machine oil can be removed with blotters and the
    iron. Place one blotter under the spot and another one over it. Use an iron
    that is not too hot and press the top blotter, gradually shifting the blotters
    until the spot disappears.</p>
  <h4>    Using cleaner </h4>
  <p>Soiled spots can usually be removed with a good cleaner sold in small cans.
    Use a scrap of goods the same as the garment as a rubbing cloth. Lighter
    or darker material often discolors the fabric. First rub a circle around
    the spot and then rub inward toward the spot. Spots made with oil can be
    removed with cleaning fluid, but when made by sweet fluid it requires water
    to remove the sugar in the spot.</p>
  <h4>    Good pressing </h4>
  <p>Press often and press well. Finish each part of the garment in pressing
    before it is assembled. The finished effect is most encouraging and will
    shorten the process of construction.</p>
  <p>Test each problem as suggested in sample material, not paper.</p>

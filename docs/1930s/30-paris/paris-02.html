  </h2>
<h3><a name="cultivate" id="cultivate"></a>Cultivate your gift for clothes.</h3>
  <p> Be yourself as you are and as you want to be. The frocks you wear will
    achieve this ambition for you. You can create a charmed circle of admiration
    wherever
      you go simply by the way you dress. Cultivate your gift for clothes. The
      puritan virtues concerning dress, while still virtues, are no longer in
fashion. Enjoy your clothes.</p>
  <p> Happiness in wearing clothes is dependent, however, on some homely and
      revealing facts. You must know what you are really like. No one else, however,
      need
know the whole truth about you.</p>
  <p> You must have a long mirror and use it unsparingly in the best possible
    light. Unflattering daylight is essential. Then examine your contours and
    your proportions
    with the same critical eye with which Hollywood examines applicants for bathing
beauty contests.</p>
  <p> Having faced the brutal facts, be reassured. Think of what you can do for
yourself that no &quot;cloak and suiter&quot; could possibly do for you.</p>
  <p> You know somewhat vaguely that certain lines usually are becoming to you.
      Now you begin to understand why this is so. In making your clothes you
    will know that since you are totally different in build from Greta Garbo
    you will
  choose a pattern which looks more like you and less like Garbo.</p>
<h3><b><i><a name="consider" id="consider"></a></i></b>Consider the necklines.</h3>
  <p> Take the matter of necks and necklines. There are short necks and long
    necks, thick necks and thin necks. The short necks must be given space. Don't
        choke them or muffle them or put strings of large pearl beads around
    them.
        Give them air. Deep V necklines add inches to short necks, both front
    and back; bateau necklines do just the opposite and frills, particularly
    starched
        organdie frills, completely choke the person to death. Long necks take
        kindly
    to rolled and frilled collars, draped blouses and unsymmetrical necklines,
      staffs, etc. If you have a long neck and a thin square jaw do not wear
        a square neckline.</p>
  <h3><i><b><a name="how" id="how"></a></b></i>How to minimize those hips.</h3>
  <p> Legs and hips must have our attention during our creative dress activities,
not after the costume is finished.</p>
  <p> Circular skirts with low flaring lines make both hips and legs appear smaller.
    Discreet exposure of legs by means of uneven hemlines or semi-sheer materials
    is much more flattering to them than exposing them against a background of
a skirt which is long in back and somewhat shorter in front.</p>
  <p> Broad hips accompanied by narrow shoulders is just one of those things
    which, being women and in many cases over 25 years, we have with us. Both
    dieting
    and dress must come to the rescue. Choose a pattern with a V bodice construction
    when you can, but be sure the V is in good position, standing right side
    up, with two of its points somewhere near the shoulders and its third point
    centered somewhere below the waistline. Do not draw material tightly around
    any of your round rear contours, nor for that matter, over a round tummy.
    Boleros, cape backs and jackets have a little swing that distracts attention
    from rounded contours below the waist. Soft blousing over a judiciously placed
    waistline often produces the desired effect. Place bows discreetly: on flat
    places&#8212;yes, if you wish; on contours&#8212;never. Consider the appearance
of bows on large bosoms. It just must not be done, that's all.</p>
<h3><b><i><a name="shoulders" id="shoulders"></a></i></b>Shoulders should get affectionate attention.</h3>
  <p> Broad shoulders are for the most part easy to dress, for the hips usually
      look slim by comparison. Unusual breadth and squareness may be reduced
      by setting sleeves into a high armhole or by using raglan sleeves. This
      lady does not wear cape sleeves or patches of embroidery on her upper arm.
      Narrow shoulders require sleeves set as far out on the tip of the shoulder
      as is consistent with a good fitting armhole. Capes are very acceptable.
Shoulder epaulette yokes increase the apparent width of the shoulder.</p>
  <p> Hands and arms cause real fits of depression at times, possibly because
      we can see them so plainly even when we are not studying effects in the
      mirror.
    Large hands are made to look larger and long ones longer by tight cuffs and
    sheath-like sleeves. If you hate yourself in a sleeveless evening dress,
    try fluttering squares of chiffon hanging from the shoulder at the back or
a short cape sleeve reaching a little above the elbow.</p>
  <p> Which ones of us wear successfully the dress with yards of bouffant taffeta
    below the waist&#8212;the robe de style? Well, there is the young tiny person,
    as well as the person who is small above the waist, but not so small below.
    Her defects are discreetly hidden by this type of dress. But what of the
    woman who is really matronly in build? No puffy bouffants for her. She would
become terrifyingly enormous.</p>
<h3><b><i><a name="advice" id="advice"></a></i></b>Advice to the voluminous.</h3>
  <p> The large woman receives lots of advice about how to dress, some of it
    unfortunately misleading. She is told to wear loosely fitting, flowing costumes,
    to wear
        trim, snugly fitting garments, to wear vertical lines avoiding, as she
        would the plague, anything horizontal in her clothes.</p>
  <p> There is more than an element of truth in all these bits of advice, but
          they should not be taken too literally. For instance, the loose flowing
          costume
        had better be made of chiffon or something soft. Some suggestion of one's
        figure is desirable to counteract the appearance of mere bulk. The large
        woman often has slim hips and it seems too bad not to make the most of
          this good feature.</p>
<h3><b><i><a name="and" id="and"></a></i></b>And about the waistlines.</h3>
  <p> Does the large woman wear the new dresses belted at the natural waistline?
      She often gets the impression that fashions revealing the natural waist
      are not for her. But it really depends upon where the belt is placed, and
      whether or not it is bound tightly about her. A suggestion of waistline
      obtained by some moulded fitting somewhere near the waistline or groups
      of tucks front, back or sides, skillfully shapes a frock without defining
      the waist. Diagonal seamings or set-in pieces in a dress may often suggest
      waistlines and produce &quot;slimming&quot; effects as well, when they
      extend from a point slightly above the waistline and descend gradually
into the skirt regions.</p>
  <p> After all, to be ourselves we must know ourselves, as well as knowing the
  fashions.</p>

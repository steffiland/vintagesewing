<h3>    <b><i><a name="fashion" id="fashion"></a></i></b>Fashion changed over night!</h3>
  <p> Here in the step-by-step evolution of a smart frock Butterick has crystallized
    the formula for successful dressmaking... a formula which resolves itself
    into these three factors... the choice of a superlatively smart style in
    a good pattern... smart fabric in a becoming tone and texture, correctly
cut... and perfect workmanship.</p>
  <p>How many of us complacently viewed our perfectly
    adequate and good-looking clothes line in our dress closet some months ago
    and felt reasonably content?
    Then what happened? Fashions changed&#8212;seemingly over night. Our nice
    modish two piece dresses with plaited skirts barely reaching our knees (sometimes
    our bare knees), our straight little jumper over-blouses with belts nonchalantly
    poised on the hip bone, our rather severely tailored necklines innocent of
    any fluffy frills,-all these perfectly wearable and hitherto undeniably chic
clothes suddenly became discards.</p>
  <p>But suppose our budget didn't permit of
    wholesale discards&#8212;and most
    of us have that kind of budget&#8212;what then? We shopped, hopefully, to
    see what we could do to rejuvenate the discouraged wardrobe. We tried on
    the new dresses. Did they fit? No, they didn't, and we looked like somebody
else whom we had seen in bad dreams but never in real life.</p>
  <p> The dresses had waistlines, but not where we had ours. They had moulded
    hips which failed to mould ours. They had long dipping hemlines which dipped
    excruciatingly.
      Moreover, as we surveyed the series of calamities, we realized that that
      dress couldn't be made to really look, even with dollars worth of fitting,
  like our very own dress.</p>
  <p> Confronted with this situation, most really smart women repair to a dressmaker
        with a reputation and a collection of chic models. The dressmaker and
    madame go into consultation, in fact many consultations, for really smart
    women
        have a very great deal to say about just how they wish their clothes
    made. Even if M. Poiret or someone equally gifted is their couturier, the
    best
        dressed women like to select their own materials, decide upon just how
        much ripple there is to be and from what point it shall start, the placing
        of
        a belt and of what it shall be made. After all, we women know more of
    the real truth about our build than anyone else. We have certainly looked
    at
    ourselves more often.</p>
<h3><b><i><a name="set" id="set"></a></i></b>Set up your own little competition with the French.</h3>
  <p> Most of us, however, cannot patronize the French couturiers or their American
      contemporaries. The only sure way for us to dress individually is to make
    our own clothes.</p>
  <p> What must we have to do this? A good range of fabrics from which to choose
    our own individual one, a good pattern with clear cutting, fitting and sewing
    directions, a sewing machine, intelligence and common sense, some patience,
    and above all, the spirit of adventure.</p>
  <p> You know on the face of it, that with these aids you can have a much better
    costume for fifteen dollars than you could buy for thirty-nine fifty, and
    it will be your dress. Mrs.. Lady-Next-Door cannot possibly have it too.</p>
  <p> The really good pattern, a Butterick pattern for instance, is the keystone
    which supports all your dressmaking accomplishments. We know that individuality
    and smartness in dress is achieved by making your clothes at home and we
    know you can do it. You do not have to be an expert. The manufacturer who
    produced your pattern is one. If you do as he tells you, using your own good
    judgment, you will be thoroughly well turned out in the best type of custom-made
    attire.</p>
  <p> Your new costume is expressed and expresses you in your favorite color,
    your best lines and your most coveted fabric. Has that ever happened to you
    in
    a &quot;ready-made&quot;? Somewhere among these things there was a compromise,
    I'm sure.</p>
  <p> To do successful home custom dressmaking observe these cautions:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>  Never economize on fabric. Someone has said a garment is never better
      than its fabric. Do not risk the misfortune of having a shabby garment
      before the season is over.    </li>
    <li> Always buy the full amount of material called for by the table on the
      pattern envelope. Skimping always shows and makes your dressmaking so much
      more difficult
    and so much more time-consuming.    </li>
    <li> Always hold the paper pattern against you to be sure of lengths and
      widths and general positions of lines, taking note of necessary changes.
      There can
    then be no unpleasant surprises in store for you.    </li>
    <li> Don't copy the best selling design in the biggest department store
      in your city. Almost anyone can own a Ford.    </li>
    <li> Pick out a pattern embodying lines which you wear well. This little
      book contains definite suggestions for doing this if you need to be reassured
      on
    this point.</li>
  </ol>

    is a thoroughly fascinating sport!</p>
  <p><b><i><a name="161" id="161"></a></i></b>161 Sixth Ave., New York</p>
  <h6>This
      is the Butterick Building, the home of Butterick Patterns, Delineator,
      and Delineator Home Institute.</h6>
  <p> Here the frock that you will presently make is visualized by expert designers,
        made on a living model and translated by master craftsmen into the magic
        tissue and Deltor.</p>
  <p> Here, on the twelfth floor, Delineator is made. Here a busy staff welds
          the contributions of a dozen different departments into the magazine
          nearly three
          million women read and endorse.</p>
  <p> And on the fifteenth floor one finds the living Delineator, Delineator
            Home Institute, where lovely interiors are constructed before your
            eyes, household
            engineer's test labor saving devices, and dietitians invent delectable
            new dishes. It is a fascinating place. Drop in some time when you
    are in New
            York.</p>

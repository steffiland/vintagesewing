<h3><a name="cutting" id="cutting"></a>Cutting up in an approved manner</h3>
  <p> Have you ever had a dress which was distinctly uncomfortable? Perhaps the
        sleeves twisted on your arm or perhaps the shoulders pulled back or the
        skirt seemed to drag to one side. Somebody cut your dress incorrectly
    and it's a mighty serious matter since no human soul can make your dress
    act
        any way but contrary during the rest of its life.</p>
  <p> This misfortune cannot befall you in your own dressmaking for you have
          a safeguard in your Butterick Deltor. You will not need to experiment
          with
        laying your pattern on material; the Butterick cutters did that before
          your Deltor was made.</p>
<h3><a name="improve" id="improve"></a>Y<a href="paris-illus/p-018.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',663,748);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-018-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 18" width="140" height="196" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>ou can't improve on the Deltor.</h3>
<p> Please, please, don't try to improve on the layout shown on the Deltor. It
      just can't be done. You will surely run into a whole series of difficulties,
      the very least of which will be shortage of material. Have implicit faith
in your tried and true Deltor.</p>
<p> What contractor ever started to build a house without his detailed drawing,
    his blue print? Your blue print is just inside your Butterick pattern envelope,
    only we call it the Deltor and it is exclusive with Butterick. It gives you
    complete and explicit directions for cutting, putting together and finishing
    your frock. Cutting layouts are a patented feature of your Deltor. There
    is a cutting layout for every width material suggested for your gown, as
    well as for every size. So, you see, every &quot;cutting problem&quot; has
been solved for you before you start.</p>
<p> The reverse side of the Deltor shows by a series of pictures, with explanations,
      how to put your dress together, step-by-step, as well as how to finish
  edges and inside parts. You just cannot go wrong.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a name="set" id="set"></a>All set to go.</h3>
<p> If you have adjusted your pattern for size and checked up on lengths as we
  asked you to do you are now ready to cut out your garment.</p>
<p> Don't think that you are laying your pattern on material simply according
        to someone's sketch of how it should be done. Every pattern we make is
          given to one of our cutters, who lays it out on material just as though
          he were
        going to cut out a dress. Carefully and skillfully he fits the pieces
  on. If the materials recommended for a design come in a number of different
          widths, say, twenty-seven, thirty-five, thirty-nine and fifty-four
  inches,
          our cutter
    must lay the pattern out on every one of these widths.</p>
<h3><a name="troublesome" id="troublesome"></a>Troublesome widths are not recommended.</h3>
<p> As he plans widths with the pattern pieces he may find that the dress cannot
        be cut easily or economically in certain widths of material. Possibly
  there will be many piecings coming in awkward places. If this should be the
  case,
  materials made in that troublesome width are not recommended on the envelope.</p>
<p> Our cutters, however, take all the time they need twisting and turning
          pattern pieces and experimenting with pieces in various positions on
          the cloth so
        that the most economical layout possible is finally made. 
    We then examine our cutters' layout and it is approved; after that an
        artist makes an exact copy of the arrangement of the pieces. A reproduction
        of
    this sketch is what you work from.</p>
<p> This is only one step in making a Butterick Pattern, but it shows you
          why you are safe in depending upon the directions and diagrams that
  are furnished
      because every other step is worked out just as painstakingly.</p>
<h3><a name="experimenting" id="experimenting"></a>No more experimenting.</h3>
<p> The Deltor on page 39 is, of course, greatly reduced in size; the separate
      layouts on page 41 are almost the size they appear on the Deltor. You can
      readily see how they save you all the trouble of experimenting and how
      you are saved the possibility of making mistakes in cutting. You will never
      be in danger of cutting two sleeves for the same arm, one of the annoying
      accidents known to have befallen amateur dressmakers who have started without
a Deltor.</p>
<p><a href="paris-illus/p-019.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',669,336);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-019-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 19" width="120" height="306" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>All you have to do is pick out the particular layout for the view you are
    reproducing in your dress, and the one for the width of material you are
    using. Suppose, for example, you are making View A and that your size is
    36, your material 39&quot; wide. The layout you will use is the one centered
    in illustration 19. Just draw a circle around it. You can then always glance
at the right one as you lay out your pattern.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a name="prepare" id="prepare"></a>Prepare the material for the worst.</h3>
<p> Turn your attention now, for a few minutes, to your material. Open it up.
        Is it free of wrinkles? If not, press it with a warm iron.</p>
<h3><a name="grain" id="grain"></a>This question of grain.</h3>
<p> Measure your material to check on the width, also to see whether you have
      the full yardage required. <a href="paris-illus/p-020.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',545,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-020-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 20" width="140" height="140" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>Straighten each end of the material. Tear along
      the crosswise thread or cut along a thread if the material cannot be torn.
      This is to assure you that each end is on the crosswise grain. The selvedges
      show the lengthwise grain. Any thread parallel to the selvedge will be
      on the lengthwise grain. Grain of material is so important in cutting that
      we cannot refrain from reminding you of it again. Be sure the &quot;grain&quot; perforations
      in the pattern fall on the corresponding grain of material. There are only
      three possibilities: lengthwise of material, either thread or fold; crosswise
      of material, either thread or fold; bias of material. Your pattern and
your Deltor will indicate clearly which one to use.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a name="stretch" id="stretch"></a>Here you can stretch a point.</h3>
<p> Start with one end of your material laying it out on the left hand corner
      of your table and stretch it out smoothly along the table in line from
      left to right. Hold it out flat by laying weights at the corners and at
      intervals along the edge. Tailors sometimes thumb tack material to their
cutting tables.</p>
<p> If the material has a right and wrong side, lay it right side up so that
    you see the design should there be any, and so that your marks through perforations
    made later, may be on the right side of the dress. If the dress has an off
    center closing or a one sided effect you will then be certain to cut each
piece for the correct side of the body.</p>
<p> When your material has an &quot;up and down&quot; caused by nap or design,
  all pieces of the pattern must be laid with their tops in the same direction.</p>
<h3><a name="selvedge" id="selvedge"></a>Let your selvedge be your guide.</h3>
<p> Where the layout calls for a fold in the center of the material, bring one
      selvedge over to the other lying along the edge of the table. Put pins
      about 6&quot; apart. Then pin the two selvedges together, smoothing the
      material as you do so. Avoid holding any fullness as you pin. Now smooth
material over to the center fold and pin along that fold also.</p>
<p> Your layout often directs you to lay the pattern on a fold which is not
        in the center. However, don't let this cause you misgivings. Just measure
        the
      widest part of the piece of the pattern which must be cut on fold. Put
  a pin in your tape measure at this point. Now measure this distance in from
      the selvedge toward the center of the cloth and mark the line with an occasional
  pin. Fold along this line of pins and lay your pattern on this fold.</p>
<p> By the way, a word about pins. Be sure they are sharp, good quality pins;
        large heavy pins may leave holes in the material or even break threads.</p>
<p> Pins are usually put in at right angles to edges except where they are
          used to mark a fold line or curve.</p>
<p> When pinning your pieces on, first be sure to locate the perforations
            showing grain and attach the pattern along the proper grain. Then
  smooth the paper
            in all directions and pin along the edges. If the piece you are pinning
            is laid on a fold, pin it along the fold first, then smooth the rest
            of the
            pattern and pin. Do not spare pins. Remember the cut of the dress
  is vital to success.</p>
<h3><a name="correct" id="correct"></a>Correct grain: the importance of following a thread.</h3>
<p> We know that &quot;grain&quot; of material is so vital to your pleasure in
    wearing your new dress that we are showing you a sketch to impress you with
how rabid we are on the subject.</p>
<p> By grain, as we have indicated, we mean the direction of the threads of which
    the material is woven. A lengthwise grain is one that follows a lengthwise
    or warp thread or is parallel to the selvedge of the cloth. A cross grain
    follows the woof or felling thread of the cloth and stretches from selvedge
    to selvedge. A bias grain cuts diagonally across the lengthwise and crosswise
    threads of the cloth. Your results will disappoint you if you try to get
    along with only an approximation of grain. All pieces of a garment must be
cut exactly on the grain &quot;to a thread.&quot;</p>
<h3><a name="twist" id="twist"></a>Why sleeves sometimes twist.</h3>
<p> People who work with fabrics develop a &quot;sense of grain&quot; both in
    their touch and with their eye. An experienced dressmaker or tailor could
    not bring herself to disregard grain, but beginners either through carelessness
    or because they think they can save an inch or two of material, sometimes
    do take liberties with it, very unwisely, and with tragic results. The sleeve
    which always twists or the skirt which drags to one side makes the garment
    practically unwearable and gives you a frustrated feeling which could have
    easily been avoided.</p>
<h3><a name="pulling" id="pulling"></a>Pulling a thread doesn't mean pulling it out.</h3>
<p> Therefore, follow a thread. In some cases pull a thread but don't pull it
        out, just pucker the line a tiny bit. Pressing will remove this slight
        pucker later. When straightening the end of materials the thread may
  be pulled out from selvedge to selvedge and the uneven end cut off along this
        line.</p>
<h3><a name="measure" id="measure"></a>If you dare not pull a thread, measure.</h3>
<p> When it is not safe or practicable to pull a thread the lengthwise grain
        can be found by measuring in equal distances from the selvedge at eight
        to ten inch intervals and marking these points with pins.</p>
<h3><a name="test" id="test"></a>Test your fold.</h3>
<p> As you fold along a straight lengthwise or crosswise grain, feel the character
        of the fold you are making. Pull it gently with your hands. If it feels
        scratchy or uneven, shift the fold slightly until you feel a straight
  firm line from hand to hand.</p>
<h3><a name="deceived" id="deceived"></a>Don't be deceived.</h3>
<p> Sometimes the crosswise grain seems to be playing you false. The line seems
        not to make right angles with the selvedge line. This is doubtless due
        to some stretching of the fabric at the mill when it was being wound
  on the boards. You will need to pull and stretch the fabric a little until
        the crosswise straight edge assumes the correct position.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a href="paris-illus/p-021.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',483,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-021-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 21" width="140" height="141" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a><a name="true" id="true"></a>True bias&#8212;a matter of triangles.</h3>
<p> To find the true bias, begin with a corner of your piece which has a straight
        crosswise end and a convenient selvedge. Measure along the selvedge a
  number of inches, and mark. From the same corner measure the same distance
  along
        the straight crosswise end of the material. Mark this point. Lay a yard
        stick on these two points and draw a line on the material with tailor's
  chalk or mark with pins or basting thread. (Ill. 21, page 47.)</p>
<p> This is your true bias line.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a href="paris-illus/p-022.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',479,817);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-022-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 22" width="140" height="131" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a><a name="special" id="special"></a>Special suggestions for plaids and stripes.</h3>
<p> Plaids, stripes and some materials with large flower designs must be made
        so as to avoid that mixed up look. Crosswise stripes should match wherever
        possible and prominent lines in plaids should be centered in both front
  and back.</p>
<p> Decide which stripe, plaid or figure is best for the center front and
          back. In general the most weighty feature of the design should be centered
          to keep
    the garment looking balanced.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a name="center" id="center"></a>Center that prominent stripe.</h3>
<p> Place front and back patterns on the material along the center of this prominent
        stripe. Then see that lower corners of the armhole edges are the same
  distance below a crosswise stripe front and back.</p>
<p> Now lay the upper edge of the sleeve pattern against the front and back
          patterns as they rest on the material with notches of sleeve matching
          notches on the
        two other parts of the pattern. Mark with a pencil on the sleeve pattern
    the crosswise stripe nearest to the notch in the sleeve pattern.</p>
<p> When laying the sleeve pattern on the material see to it that this pencil
          line falls on a crosswise stripe. Lay the cuff pattern on the material
          before cutting the sleeve and mark the position of a lengthwise stripe
          on the cuff
      to correspond with a stripe on the sleeve.</p>
<h3><a name="trick" id="trick"></a>There's a trick to cutting two of a kind.</h3>
<p> After one of all these pieces has been cut, lay each one of them on the material
        with the right sides of material together and cut the second front, back,
        sleeve and cuff. Lay the pattern on the second set of cut pieces and
  mark notches and perforations.</p>
<p> And, of course, all pieces of the pattern must be laid on irregular plaids
        or flowered materials showing an up and down, with the top of the pieces
    in the same direction.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a href="paris-illus/p-023.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',659,691);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-023-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 23" width="140" height="209" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a><a name="cut" id="cut"></a>Cut all Butterick dresses at the edge of the paper.</h3>
<p> Your scissors are nice sharp ones, I hope, with at least 7 inch blades. Some
        people like to use even larger ones. Small scissors produce choppy edges
        which fray and are somewhat hard to follow. As you cut keep your scissors
        down against your material, don't lift them. Use long, even cutting strokes
        and cut exactly on the edge of the paper pattern. When you use Butterick
        patterns you do not need to allow for a seam. All seams are allowed for
        you on the paper. Any additional allowance will make the garment too
  large for you and you will lose the nicety of its proportions. Neither must
  you
  complete the manufacturing process and trim off ragged paper edges.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a name="exception" id="exception"></a>The exception that proves the rule.</h3>
<p> There is just one exception to this statement. If you are working on material
        which frays very badly you should allow one eighth of an inch on all
  seams except the large let-out seams. It is not necessary to make additional
        allowance on the let-out seams (you know they are wider than all the
  other
  seams) as they cover the amount the material frays.</p>
<p> As soon as you have cut a garment from loosely woven, scratchy material
          you should overcast or put a line of loose machine stitching around
  the curved
        arm hole edges and neck edges. This keeps the seam allowance from ravelling
    while you work on the garment.</p>
<h3><a name="pattern" id="pattern"></a>When there is no pattern piece.</h3>
<p> Sometimes bias bindings, ruffed, flower petals, or other trimming and finishing
        pieces which do not require a pattern are cut from pieces of material
  left over after the garment is cut. The Deltor layout shows where these may
        be cut to the best advantage.</p>
<h3><a name="mark" id="mark"></a>Mark notches and perforations.</h3>
<p> Be Scotch: use everything you paid for when you bought your pattern. Each
        notch and perforation was figured into the price of your pattern.</p>
<p> Two of the most essential places to mark are the center front and the
          center back, in both waist and skirt. You see your dress balances on
          you correctly
        if these lines fall straight down in both front and back. The best way
          to mark these lines is with a line of uneven basting, and these two
  lines, by
        the way, are the last two bastings you remove from your dress when you
          have completed all the finishing touches.</p>
<h3><a href="paris-illus/p-024.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',670,273);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-024-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 24" width="125" height="269" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a><a name="notches" id="notches"></a>Mark notches with basting stitches.</h3>
<p> The notches can be marked with two or three short basting stitches. (Ill.
      24.) They may be cut but we don't advise this method since one is so apt
      to cut them too deeply&#8212;1/8 inch is ample. Sometimes even this shallow
      notch may prevent a slight alteration in the seam if that should become
necessary.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a name="tacks" id="tacks"></a>Mark perforations with tailor's tacks.</h3>
<p> The very best way to mark perforations is by using tailor's tacks since you
        can then mark them through two pieces of material at once. A very good
        plan is to mark all small perforations with one color thread and all
  large perforations with another color.</p>
<p> Tailor's tacks are thread marks placed in the material, made through
          the perforations in the tissue paper pattern.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a href="paris-illus/p-025.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',670,270);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-025-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 25" width="140" height="274" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a><a name="this" id="this"></a>This is the way to make tailor's tacks.</h3>
<p> Use a double thread preferably without a knot. Take a stitch or two stitches
        one over the other through each perforation and down through both pieces
        of material if the material is double. Where there is a row of perforations
        close together like those at the shoulder seam or the underarm seam,
  take a row of stitches through each perforation and leave a loop between each
        perforation. (Ill. 25.) Cut the thread half way between the perforations
  and take the pattern off.</p>
<p> Now, to separate the two pieces of material, pull them slightly apart
          and snip through each tailor's tack between the two pieces of material.
          A little
        whisker of basting thread will be left in each piece indicating where
  each perforation comes in the pattern.</p>

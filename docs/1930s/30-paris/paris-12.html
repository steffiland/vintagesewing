  <p>We want to tell you some of the things we have found out about pressing
    to help you give the professional appearance to your dressmaking. This chapter
    comes near the end of the book only because we have found no good place to
    put it in before. We feel that careful pressing is just as necessary to your
    dressmaking success as correct cutting or fitting or any of the other processes
    we have described.</p>
<h3><a name="you" id="you"></a>You will need good tools.</h3>
  <p> Special boards and tailor's cushions will make your pressing much easier.
      There is a difference between ironing and pressing in the dressmaker's
      sense. When you press you seldom drag the iron along the material but you
      do pat the iron down on the cloth. That is, you really &quot;press&quot; against
the cloth rather than draw a hot iron along a seam or an edge.</p>
  <p> You need, of course, an electric iron or an ordinary six pound flat iron.
      A good ironing board is just as necessary. It should have a smooth, firm,
      but rather cushion-like surface. Ridges or hollows in your ironing board
will cause the mark of the iron to be imprinted on your material.</p>
  <p> Your ironing board should be covered with at least four thicknesses of
        cotton felt which may be bought at any store that carries tailor's and
        dressmaker's
        supplies. You can also buy heavy pads with accompanying unbleached muslin
        covers with the tapes attached. An old blanket folded over as many times
        as necessary may be used instead of pads. See to it, however, that there
        are no holes in the blanket as they will cause unevenness in the pressing
surface.</p>
  <h3><a name="tailors" id="tailors"></a>A tailor's cushion makes pressing scientific.</h3>
  <p><a href="paris-illus/p-170.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',340,545);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-170-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 170" width="140" height="115" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>If you have never used a tailor's cushion, you have no conception of how
      easily your pressing can be done. The cushion is invaluable for pressing
      darts and curved seams like armhole seams. The cushion is shaped like a
      ham and is tightly stuffed with cotton rags. Sawdust is still better if
      you can get it easily. To make your cushion, cut two pieces of firm unbleached
      muslin, eighteen by fourteen inches, cutting them somewhat narrower at
      one end. Round off all the edges. Stitch the seam with a 3/8&quot; allowance,
with a close machine stitch. (Ill. 170.)</p>
  <p> Seams pressed over the cushion will open out very flat but no ridge or
        shiny mark from the seam allowance will show up on the right side of
    the garment.
      When pressing seams open, dampen the seam very slightly if the material
    is not injured by dampness, and press down on the seam using the iron carefully,
      taking it up and putting it down often. You may bear down heavily on the
      iron but you may not drag it. Very little dampness should be used on textures
with lightly napped surfaces since pressing will flatten the nap.</p>
  <p> Little or no dampness should be used on silks. A damp cloth with the water
        wrung out and partly dried under the iron may be used on seams between
the dress and the iron, usually on the wrong side of the garment.</p>
  <h3 class="clear">    <a name="special" id="special"></a>Special pressing technique for velvets.</h3>
  <p> For <a href="paris-illus/p-172.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',488,815);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-172-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 170" width="140" height="161" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>pressing velvet <a href="paris-illus/p-171.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',298,635);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-171-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 171" width="140" height="127" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>sleeves and short seams, a sleeve board is very helpful.
      The board may be attached to a standard (Ill. 171) or it may be just a
    plain board two or three feet long, tapering from six inches in width at
    one end
      to three inches at the other. Edges and ends should be rounded off. Your
      sleeve board should be padded just like your ironing board. Velvet, plush,
      and wool fabrics with a pile can be successfully pressed only on a wire
    pressing board made especially for the purpose. Short wires are set close
    together
      on a heavy canvas back. This may be thumb tacked to a flat board. The velvet
      is laid right side down against the wires so that when the pressing is
  done on the wrong side the pile sinks between the wires.</p>
  <p class="clear"> <a href="paris-illus/p-173.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',636,814);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-173-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 173" width="140" height="157" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>There is still another way to use the wire board. Where you wish to press
        a facing on a neckline or on the front of a coat made of nap fabrics
    remove the canvas from the board. Lay one side of the garment against the
    wire
        surface; fold the canvas over on to the faced portion of the garment.
    Then lay a dampened
    cloth against the canvas and press. (Illustration 173.)</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a name="steaming" id="steaming"></a>Steaming over a sleeve board.</h3>
  <p> If you should not care to get a velvet pressing board for occasional use
  you may steam your velvets and napped fabrics over your sleeve board.</p>
  <p> <a href="paris-illus/p-174.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',477,816);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-174-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 174" width="140" height="128" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>Invert a heated iron and slip the handle over the small end of the sleeve
        board. Rest the ends of the sleeve board on some books or something to
          hold it steady. Cover the face of the hot iron with a damp cloth and
          gently draw
    the wrong side of the velvet over the dampened muslin.</p>
  <p> Most tailors and cleaners have large steaming boards. If you find it
          difficult to steam your velvet things successfully it may be of greater
          assistance
      to you in your own dressmaking to send out garments of this kind to the
    tailor.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><a href="paris-illus/p-175.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',477,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-175-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 175" width="140" height="144" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a><a name="panne" id="panne"></a>Panne velvet this way.</h3>
  <p> Panne or mirror velvet has the pile partly flattened. To get this effect
        on an ordinary erect pile velvet, iron the surface of the velvet in the
        direction of the nap. Velvet after being treated this way can be pressed
        like any other fabric in the ordinary way.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a name="home" id="home"></a>The home dressmaker presses like a professional.</h3>
  <p> You do practically all pressing on the wrong side of the fabric although
      suitings and heavy coating may be pressed on the right side, steaming with
      a, damp cloth between the fabric and the iron. Press over this cloth until
      the pressing cloth is nearly dry. The heavier the fabric in the garment,
      the heavier the pressing cloth one uses. When wool fabric has been steamed
      this way on the right side, turn the garment wrong side out and press until
the fabric is entirely dry.</p>
  <p> If the material becomes shiny during the pressing remove the shine by placing
    a dry cloth over the shiny place. Over this place a damp cloth and with a
    hot iron press lightly over the spot. Where the nap has become flattened
during pressing, the surface should be brushed with a stiff brush.</p>
  <p> When pressing a skirt, turn it wrong side out and slip it over the ironing
    board. Pin the top and bottom of the skirt to the ironing board being careful
    to see that any plaits lie flat against the board. A damp pressing cloth
is laid over the skirt material and pressed thoroughly until it is dry.</p>
  <p> When pressing silk materials use a warm iron&#8212;never a hot one. The iron
    may be run under the plaits after the whole skirt has been pressed to fatten
the part underneath.</p>
<h3><a name="shrink" id="shrink"></a>Shrink your woolens before they get a chance.</h3>
  <p> Moisture shrinks woolens about two and a half inches to the yard. High
    grade woolen fabrics are usually shrunken by the manufacturer. But always
    play
        safe and buy enough to allow for possible shrinkage which may take place.
        Some stores will arrange to do your shrinking for you. If this service
        is not available you should take your material to a tailor to have it
    done. If this should not be possible shrink your fabric yourself.</p>
  <p> You will need a large table, an ironing blanket and a piece of heavy
        unbleached muslin the width of your material and one half its length.</p>
  <p> Wet the muslin with cold water and wring it out. Lay your woolen material
          face down on the table. Place the damp unbleached muslin on half of
    your woolen, smoothing it flat. Fold the other half of the woolen material
            over it and roll the material and the sponging cloth together in
    a
            tight roll.
          Let it lie over night covered with a piece of muslin. The next day
    unroll the material, pressing it dry on the wrong side as you unroll.</p>
  <p> Woolens with a deep pile should be steamed instead of sponged. Use
            the same equipment as for sponging. Lay the pile fabric down on the
            pressing
            blanket
            with the wet muslin over it. Use a moderately hot iron and press
    it against the damp cloth just enough to let the steam penetrate the woolen
            material.
            Pass the iron over the muslin easily, do not let it rest anywhere
    lest
            the mark of the iron appear on the cloth.</p>

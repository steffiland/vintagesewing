<h3><a name="waterloo" id="waterloo"></a>The Fabric Counter may be your Waterloo.</h3>
  <p> Each one of us has our special color pals&#8212;we like them a lot&#8212;when
    they are near us we get a real thrill. There are literally hundreds of these
colors waiting on every fabric counter.</p>
  <p> However, some of these possible colors are more friendly than others. We
      do not all respond in the same way to all colors. Some colors always make
      us happy while others make us miserable. Some make us vaguely uncomfortable
      and others make us comfortably contented. Perhaps you have never realized
      how much power for pleasure or pain is inherent in an innocent looking
  five yards of material.</p>
  <p> Warm colors, the reds, oranges, yellows, some greens and some purple-reds,
        are definitely exhilarating to some people-and in some cases sufficiently
        exciting to be really disturbing.</p>
  <p> Cool colors, on the other hand, like blues, blue-greens, violets and
          some greens cause reactions ranging all the way from a sense of calmness
          and
          security to the deepest depression amounting almost to an inferiority
          complex.</p>
  <p> Individuals react in different degrees of intensity to warm and cool
            colors depending upon their temperament.</p>
<h3><b><i><a name="befriend" id="befriend"></a></i></b>What colors befriend you?</h3>
  <p> Since colors have so much power over our feelings it becomes a matter of
      extreme importance that we know which ones are friendly and which are out
to &quot;do us wrong.&quot;</p>
  <p> The colors you wear may be the greatest single aid or hindrance to your
  social or business success. Did that ever occur to you?</p>
  <p> The color of your dress may completely upset the effectiveness of your
          carefully designed, well selected Butterick pattern by rendering you
          so insignificant
    that no one sees you at all.</p>
<h3><b><i><a name="quite" id="quite"></a></i></b>There is no one quite like you.</h3>
  <p> If all people reacted the same way to colors we could just give you a set
      of rules about what happens when one wears red, for instance, and all you
      would have to do is memorize the rules and be assured that all would be
      well. But we can't do it that way since no two people are exactly alike.
      Do you know anyone exactly like you except possibly your twin sister? No
      two people have exactly the same combination of coloring of hair, eyes
      and skin together with build and facial expression. In other words, no
      two personalities are exactly alike. But what about &quot;types&quot; you
      say? It's a comfortable theory but it just doesn't work when you start
      out to select your own best colors. Few of us are types, most of us are
a mixture of characteristics found in a number of so-called types.</p>
  <p> The exact coloring of your own hair, eyes and skin as well as your own
        special personally must be taken into account in accurately determining
        which colors
  are best for you.</p>
  <h3><b><i><a name="habit" id="habit"></a></i></b>The one-color habit cramps your style.</h3>
  <p> Some of us have certain beliefs and habits concerning colors which may
    be cramping our style badly. We have usually found in assisting people to
        select their colors that we can increase very greatly the range.</p>
<h3><b><i><a name="brown" id="brown"></a></i></b>A cure for a dark brown taste.</h3>
  <p> I think in this connection of a certain dean at a woman's college who has
      the &quot;brown habit&quot; so badly that she is making herself look years
      older than her age. When she herself was a student in college brown was
      undoubtedly one of her best colors and she forthwith adopted it for life.
      She not only dresses in it but furnishes her entire house in browns, oranges
      and some yellows. She writes with brown ink, and even uses a brown typewriter
      ribbon. The fact she seems not to realize is that the color of her hair
      and skin has changed with the years. Her build is different, and the sparkle
      of her eyes is not so bright, or if it is, the way she dresses deadens
      her personality. If someone could just induce her to wear some rich dark
      reds or some bright dark blue-greens the magnetism which she unquestionably
      possesses would be apparent the instant she steps into a room or sets foot
on the campus.</p>
  <p> How then shall we make a discriminating selection of colors for our clothes
  so that we may be reasonably sure of choosing the right ones?</p>
<h3><b><i><a name="rules" id="rules"></a></i></b>These color rules are for you.</h3>
  <p> Some general suggestions about choosing colors should be of practical help
  to you.</p>
  <p> First think of yourself as an individual, not as someone approximating
    a type.</p>
  <p> Then consider the color of your skin, face, neck and all that is usually
          exposed by the present fashion for open necked daytime dresses. After
            all, more square inches of skin coloring enter into your personal
    color harmony
      than hair or eye coloring.</p>
<h3><b><i><a name="reds" id="reds"></a></i></b>Reds vitalize the skins.</h3>
  <p> Dressing to your skin coloring is very simple. You just choose colors which
  will make your skin look as vital as possible.</p>
  <p> In general, the colors which will do this are certain reds, if not too
          bright, pale coral or tea-rose pink as it is sometimes called, peach
          color, and a
        flesh color with a warm or somewhat yellowish cast, sometimes called
    cameo shell.</p>
  <h3><b><i><a name="transparent" id="transparent"></a></i></b>For transparent skins.</h3>
  <p> For the fragile looking, rather transparent skinned person certain cool
    reds if not too dark and seemingly heavy, and pale cool pinks cast a subtle
        delicate flush over the skin. The only person whose skin just can not
    be
        dressed in red of any tone is the rather florid, red faced or red nosed
        lady.</p>
<h3><b><i><a name="bluegreen" id="bluegreen"></a></i></b>Blue-greens do astonishing things.</h3>
  <p> Still another color range, which does very flattering things to skins is
        the blue-green color family. Blue-greens suggest their opposites... the
        reds, the vital glowing tints which we must simulate in a subdued way
  if they are not actually present somewhere below the surface.</p>
  <p> Dark, light and medium blue-greens, provided they are not too bright,
          do really astonishing things to freshen skins. If you happen to have
          a decidedly
        purple-blue eye the blue-greens may make your eyes look somewhat steel-like
        and impersonal. Intense jade green in large amounts makes a dark skin
    look too swarthy or a florid skin too coarse, but is very becoming to a honey
    color sun-tan skin.</p>
  <h3><b><i><a name="hair" id="hair"></a></i></b>The hair has its becoming colors too.</h3>
  <p> Next let us examine colors which do the very nicest things to our hair.
    Hair coloring usually tones into the yellow, red or brown color paths. Some
        blond hair seems to measure in a clear warm yellow path and presents
    few
        color problems. Those of us who have hair of the mouse colored, medium
        blond variety will get the maximum clear color effect by wearing dark
    browns, navy blue and dark reds, provided these colors are also good with
    the skin
        and eyes. The person with medium blond hair avoids beige as a rule.</p>
<h3><b><i><a name="gray" id="gray"></a></i></b>Gray hair is a problem.</h3>
  <p> The person whose hair has started to get gray has a real problem because
        of this mixed stripy effect in her hair. She must avoid any colors or
    textures which call attention to the nondescript character of her hair. As
    a rule
        she dresses in either dark or light colors avoiding medium shades or
    middle values, provided of course her build is such that she may wear light
    colors
  successfully.</p>
  <p> Black sometimes produces a very distinguished effect when one's hair
          is this mixed color, since it intensifies the dark tones still left
    in the hair and
        throws into relief the silvery high lights, and an otherwise dull pepper
    and salt effect becomes clear cut and sparkling.</p>
  <h3><b><i><a name="tweeds" id="tweeds"></a></i></b>Select your tweeds carefully.</h3>
  <p> Strong bright browns are usually very unfriendly to this mixed hair. Tweeds
        should be selected carefully. The red, green, blue-green, or warm purple
        tweed mixtures do much more for gray hair than black and white tweeds,
        altho black and white may be used for a coat when one always wears a
    hat.</p>
<h3><b><i><a name="white" id="white"></a></i></b>Color contrasts flatter white hair.</h3>
  <p> White haired women have a comparatively easy time with their color selections.
        Any color which contrasts with white hair will be flattering with the
    possible exception of brown. Even this color may be used in velvet or furs
    if the
        white haired lady has a clear skin and brown or hazel eyes. Beige sweaters
        and hats do nothing whatever for her hair, altho it is so beautiful that
        even they cannot seriously damage it. She might better select colors
    of greater depth and clearness, dark, light or medium but seldom exceedingly
        bright.</p>
  <p> Gray for gray haired people? Yes, by all means, provided it tones into
          the same kind of gray as appears in the hair. A warm gray is apt to
    be more becoming
        than a cold slatey gray, since the effect of blue-gray against the skin
          is chilling.</p>
<h3><b><i><a name="eyes" id="eyes"></a></i></b>The eyes have it.</h3>
  <p> You may wonder why we have postponed a consideration of the color of the
        eyes. You doubtless have heard repeatedly that if one's clothes match
    one's eyes, then all will be well. But wait. We realize now, that the colors
        we wear must be becoming first to our skin and then to the hair and eyes.
  Eye color is subtle and sparkling.</p>
  <p> Most eyes are mixed in color. That is, a brown eye often has in it certain
        dull yellow lights as well as dark yellow-red lights. Blue eyes may be
          either purple-blue, almost violet, clear blue, or blue-green, often
    showing flecks
        of tiny streaks of yellow-red. So-called hazel eyes are often chiefly
    yellow-green. Whatever color we wear should add to the depth and sympathetic
    expression
    of the eye.</p>
  <h3><b><i><a name="browneyes" id="browneyes"></a></i></b>Brown for brown eyes.</h3>
  <p> Brown, reds and greens will all deepen the color of brown eyes while certain
        rather bright dark blues will make the so-called black eye (which is
    really a dark yellow-red eye) look dark and velvety.</p>
<h3><b><i><a name="blueeyes" id="blueeyes"></a></i></b>Blue for blue eyes.</h3>
  <p> Blue for blue eyes is safe enough providing it is the particular blue that
        matches the blue in your eye. Purple-blue worn by a person with green-blue
        eyes has the effect of producing a rather colorless gray eye which looks
  as hard as nails.</p>
  <p> Hazel eyes are rather fun to dress since one can be green eyed one day
          and amber eyed the next, depending upon which of the colors in one's
          eyes is
        intensified by one's dress. Yellow-greens produce an amber light which
          is most alluring and provocative while certain warm red-purples give
          these eyes
    a greenish cast and a quizzical and sophisticated expression.</p>
<h3><b><i><a name="black" id="black"></a></i></b>Who wears black well?</h3>
  <p> How many times we are asked, &quot;Can I wear black?&quot; The answer is
    yes, in ninety-nine cases out of one hundred. The trick is to choose it in
    the right texture. For some skins, black should be worn with a softening
    color or texture between the black fabric and the skin. This is true when
    the skin is of china-like transparency and rather colorless, as well, as
when the skin is inclined to be sallow.</p>
  <p> The flattering transition colors to wear with black are warm flesh color,
      egg shell, nude, Vionnet pinks, pale coral. Antique ivory, especially in
  nets, fine laces, and batistes is flattering to any skin.</p>
<h3><b><i><a name="texture" id="texture"></a></i></b>The secret is in the texture.</h3>
  <p> And now, what of this all important matter of textures for our black costumes?
        Black canton crepe, crepe marocain, crepe faille, or some of the more
    sparkling pebbly crepes are more becoming than flat crepe or crepe de chine.
    Shiny
        black satin is trying but becomes less so as we choose satins of subdued
        brilliance, with a finish more like poult de soie. Many people can wear
        black satin, however, who would find satins in strong colors unflattering
      to their build and ageing to their skins.</p>
  <p> Transparent black is usually very flattering and the semi-transparent
          materials such as crepe roma, elizabeth, triple voile, fiat chiffon,
          wool crepe and
        wool georgette can be counted upon to take pounds from your figure.</p>
  <p> Taffeta, if black and very stiff, produces an austere effect. The stiffness
          of line and sudden contrast of high light and shadow in this material
          has a staccato feeling which is very becoming to youthful faces and
    figures in bouffant costumes.</p>
  <h3><b><i><a name="dirt" id="dirt"></a></i></b>White can do you dirt.</h3>
  <p> White&#8212;innocent enough looking as it is, may play the very dickens when
    clasped to your bosom. Dead white is trying in almost any texture to all
    but the most perfect skins as well as adding to the apparent size of the
    figure. &quot;Off-white&quot; tones, on the contrary, are flattering.</p>
  <h3><i><b><a name="pastels" id="pastels"></a></b></i>Pastels are flattering.</h3>
  <p> Pale slightly grayed pastels, such as flesh color, Vionnet pink, cameo
    shell, egg shell, nude, pale orchid, peach color, tea-rose, water greens,
    pale
        aquamarine, maize, endive, and very pale warm yellow reds, old ivory,
    etc., often have the effect of clarifying a somewhat sallow skin. The only
    way
        to discover which are your best pastels is by holding them next to your
        face and throat and studying the effect. Try them in soft crepes or chiffons.
        Satins may not be so flattering.</p>
  <h3><b><i><a name="wise" id="wise"></a></i></b>A word to the wise.</h3>
  <p> Just a few cautions concerning colors that may not always prove good friends.
        Strong bright purple-blue, the so-called royal blue, or blue glory, is
        very trying to most skins. Watch out for this color, since the color
    itself seems to have a great appeal, especially to our husbands and to all
    male
        buyers in department stores. It always appears under some name on each
        season's color card. This strong bright purple-blue calls forth all the
        lurking yellow which may be an underlying color in the skins of many
    of us, and so causes us to have brownish shadows in hollows around the eyes,
        about the mouth and in the throat. Two types of women do wear this color
        well, however. One is the clear skinned girl with purple-blue eyes and
        spun gold hair. The other is the Irish type with fair, peaches and cream
        skin, clear blue eyes-or snappy brown eyes and black hair.</p>
<h3><b><i><a name="purples" id="purples"></a></i></b>Purples must be handled with care.</h3>
  <p> This is supposed to be a good color for the matronly type or elderly woman.
        Most purples drain color from skins, but certain warm red-purples, like
        the Patou purple of a recent season, do wonderful things to clear skins
        and brighten eyes. Look for the eggplant colors then, if you like to
  wear purple. Royal purple is unfriendly to almost every one.</p>
  <p> In a season when it is fashionable to look swarthy and heavily sun tanned,
        these strong bright purples, blues, greens, and oranges are worn by the
          younger set to enhance this effect. Both the purple and purple-blue,
          however, have
    the effect of coarsening the skin.</p>
  <h3><i><b><a name="slave" id="slave"></a></b></i>Don't be a slave to fashion.</h3>
  <p> What shall we do concerning fashions in colors? Fashion is so important
    that it must receive a large share of our attention. Every season certain
    colors
        receive favorable fashion acceptance. There are always enough of these
        fashion-right colors and various shades in them in the shops to make
    it entirely possible to secure a varied color wardrobe of our own becoming
        colors. But always remember, nothing is gained by wearing a fashion-right
        color which is desperately unfriendly to your skin, eyes and hair.</p>

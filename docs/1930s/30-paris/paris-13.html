<h3><a name="emancipation" id="emancipation"></a>Emancipation for washwomen</h3>
  <p> The weekly wash would have no terrors if it consisted of the clothes we
    women wear. Fine materials an scanty garments, both as to size an number,
    have
        changed the whole aspect of wash day. In fact, one's personal ash might
      well be done in a wash bowl.</p>
  <p> Successful results in washing our stockings, gloves, scarfs, dresses
        and soft, silky lingerie depend upon our washing methods.</p>
  <p> Washing the little accessories has become so simple that it is possible
          at all times to step out looking immaculate to the smallest detail.</p>
  <h3><a name="rules" id="rules"></a>These are the new rules for washing.</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>  Prepare moderately warm suds, with a mild, pure soap&#8212;flakes,
    beads or cake.</li>
    <li> Squeeze or knead the suds through the garment from three to five
      minutes.</li>
    <li> Rinse two or three times in lukewarm water.</li>
    <li> Squeeze the water from the garment.</li>
    <li> Roll tightly for a few minutes in a bath towel.</li>
    <li> If colors are doubtful, remove from towel.</li>
    <li> Iron on the wrong side with a moderate iron before the garment has
                  become entirely dry.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3><a name="directions" id="directions"></a>Directions for preparing the suds.</h3>
  <p> Start with a small quantity of hot water in the pan or the basin. Dissolve
      the soap in the hot water and then add cold water to bring the temperature
      to about 100&deg; F. or a temperature which feels comfortable to the hands.
      Do not wash any of your fine garment in too hot water. If you want to be
      accurate, a tablespoon of soap flakes to a gallon of soft water makes the
      water just about soap enough. Hard water requires more soap or a little
      borax or water softener. Great billows of fluffy suds get in the way of
      your washing an are a nuisance to rinse but the water should remain moderately
      sudsy. If the suds break down add more dissolved soap to the wash water.</p>
  <h3><a name="smart" id="smart"></a>The smart woman is a smart wash woman.</h3>
  <p> This is the way we wash our clothes. We do a great deal of squeezing and
        a very little or no rubbing. Shades of the good old wash board! Squeeze
        or knead the suds through the garment. When the water gets dark in color,
        wash the garments again in fresh suds for three to five minutes. Grimy
        edges or muddy spots may need a little light rubbing between the hands.
        Don't rub too long or too hard.</p>
  <h3><a name="rinse" id="rinse"></a>This is the way we rinse our clothes.</h3>
  <p> Two thorough rinsings should be sufficient, if plenty of water is used
    each time. The temperature of the water should be the same as you used for
    washing.
        If the colors show a tendency to run, the rinse water should be colder,
        or even cold, since cold water retards the running of color. White silks
        should be washed and rinsed in moderately warm water. Hot water as well
        as direct sunlight during drying will turn silk yellow. Finish white
    silks in a lightly blued rinse water.</p>
<h3><a name="wring" id="wring"></a>This is the way we wring our clothes.</h3>
  <p> Remove the rinse water from your clothes by squeezing, not by wringing.
    Hard twisting strains and breaks fine threads. Wringing out stockings and
    knitted
        silk undergarments will twist and weaken the threads so badly that runs
        may start. Knitted garment which do not need ironing should be pulled
    into shape and hung up to dry indoors away from direct sunlight or heat but
        preferably in a draft. Rayon garments should be hung up without clothes
  pins. The pressure of the wooden pin tends to break wet rayon threads.</p>
  <p> When garments are to be ironed do not let them get thoroughly dry but
          roll up between two large bath towels or two pieces of an old sheet.
          Cover the
        roll with another towel and leave it rolled tightly until you are ready
          to iron. If the garment is colored and inclined to run roll it between
          towels
        to take out the excess moisture. Tae it out immediately and shake it
    in a draft or before an electric fan until it is almost dry and press it
          immediately.
        The color in a garment seldom streaks while it is being washed but it
    may do so during drying of the garment if the garment dries too slowly. The
          trick is to wash quickly, absorb the excess moisture quickly, shake
    dry
          and press
        immediately.</p>
  <p> We used to think that colors could be set by putting salt or vinegar
          in the water during washing. This is not the case. The only sure way
          to wash
          fugitive
          colors successfully is to have everything ready before you begin and
          then work fast.</p>
  <h3><a name="iron" id="iron"></a>This is the way we iron our clothes.</h3>
  <p> Your washing should have removed all the soil and loose dye from your garment.
      Then drying and ironing should be done rapidly&#8212;but do not hang anything
      on a hot radiator in your desire to speed up the drying process. It doesn't
      pay.</p>
  <h3><a name="consider" id="consider"></a>Consider weight and weave.</h3>
  <p> The weight and weave of your material determines how damp the garment should
        be when it is ironed. Some crepes in silks, synthetic fabrics or cotton
        should be ironed when they are practically dry. Elastic crepe weaves
    will stretch badly if ironed moist. Flat weaves in silk, like broadcloth,
    radium
        or flat crepe, should be damp when ironed. Most silks, however, are ironed
        when practically dry since moist silk when ironed with a hot iron becomes
        stiff and wiry looking. If a silk material needs to be dampened do not
        sprinkle it but roll it up with a slightly damp cheese cloth. The moisture
        will penetrate evenly.</p>
<h3><a name="dont" id="dont"></a>Don't run a temperature.</h3>
  <p> Too hot an iron will injure fabrics. An iron which sizzles slightly when
        touched with a moist finger is safe for cottons. A slightly cooler iron
        should be used for silks and a much cooler iron should be used for synthetic
        fabrics. There are electric irons on the market which can be adjusted
    to three temperatures, low, medium, and high. There will shortly be irons
        which not only have temperature controls but will also have temperature
  indicator as well.</p>
  <p> Garments are usually pressed on the wrong side. Where you have to press
          double material, press first on the wrong side, then cover the right
          side with a
        piece of cheese cloth and press again on the right side. When ironing,
          the strokes of the iron should follow either the lengthwise grain or
          the crosswise
        grain of the material. Iron with the threads of material, not diagonally
        across them. Loose ends on a garment are usually iron first, then the
    sleeves, and then the body of the garment. One usually works from the top
    towards
    the bottom.</p>
  <h3><a name="keep" id="keep"></a>Keep the plaits under control.</h3>
  <p> An easy way to launder plaited collars is to run a row of bastings to hold
        down the plaits at the edge. Plaits in skirts should be basted down at
        the bottom and at intervals of 6 or 8 inches up the skirt, before the
    dress is washed.</p>
  <h3><a name="graceful" id="graceful"></a>Graceful flares must hold their shape.</h3>
  <p> Generally speaking, it is better to get the effect of fullness in wash
    dresses by means of plaits rather than flares since flaring sections present
    greater
      difficulty in ironing. Always iron flares along either the lengthwise or
      the crosswise thread of the weave&#8212;never iron on the bias. This will
      keep your circular flares in position. Ironing on the bias will pull the
      flared portion of your skirt out of place and make the skirt hang badly.
      Hang your dress up for a day or so before wearing it so that the flared
      part of the skirt will fall into line.</p>
  <h3><a name="use" id="use"></a>Use beaded garments gently.</h3>
  <p> If you should need to launder a beaded dress or collar, use the same method
        as for thin crepe. Do not put beaded garments through the wringer. You
        will break the beads. To iron, lay the garment right side down on a Turkish
        towel or soft pressing surface and iron on the wrong side. This should
        be done also with embroidered garments so that the embroidered design
    will stand up from the surface.</p>
<h3><a name="dye" id="dye"></a>To dye or not to dye.</h3>
  <p> When pastel colored garments have lost their color during washing one of
the good tinted washing dyes or dye soaps will restore their freshness.  </p>
  <h3><a href="paris-illus/p-176.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',496,815);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-176-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 176" width="140" height="135" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a><a name="shrinks" id="shrinks"></a>Washing no longer shrinks our woolens.</h3>
  <p> Washing woolens is not easy. The modern way of washing, however, will keep
        them from shrinking if we follow these directions in every respect. Wool
        fibers which are spun to make wool yarn and thread have a surface made
        up of small overlapping scales. The natural oil in the sheep's skin keeps
        these tiny scales lubricated and soft. When the wool is cut off, the
    scales show a tendency to slowly dry out. In correct washing will cause the
    wool
        fiber to harden, stiffen and draw together, in other words, shrink, as
        well as become yellow in color. Hard shrunken woolen fabrics have not
    only become shorter than they were originally but they have lost a great
    deal
        of their warmth. Our washing then, must preserve the softness and fluffiness
        which the wool had when it came from the sheep's back in all its lovely
      color.</p>
  <p> There are four easily avoidable conditions which tend to destroy the
          softness of woolens and make them shrink. The first is hard rubbing
    while wet, the
        second is the placing of the material in hot water, the third is a sudden
        change fro hot to cold water during washing or rinsing, and the fourth
          is the presence of strong alkali in the soap used for washing.</p>
  <p> Hard rubbing or friction will cause woolens to shrink and get board-like
          more quickly than anything else. Since this is the case, dirt should
            be squeezed and floated out of woolen materials, never rubbed.</p>
  <h3><a name="weather" id="weather"></a>Take a look at the weather.</h3>
  <p> Before you embark on a laundry job on your blankets or Junior's white flannel
        trousers, take a look at the weather. If the day is sticky and humid
    and breathless even though the sun is shining, postpone your laundry day.
    To
        dry woolens successfully you need clear fresh air and a good breeze.
    If the pieces are small like the children's white berets, you can hasten
    drying
        by turning on the electric fan.</p>
<h3><a name="measure" id="measure"></a>Measure your sweaters before you wash.</h3>
  <p> Measure the size of your woolen garments before you begin to was them,
    sleeve lengths, width across the chest, length of underarm seam, length of
    shoulder
        line, width at the bottom, and write these measurements down.</p>
  <p> Baby's stockings and little shirts should be slipped on the right sized
          wooden drying frames in order to dry them quickly and keep them the
    correct size.</p>
<h3><a name="wash" id="wash"></a>Wash woolens this way.</h3>
  <p> Washing water and all rinsing waters, as well, for woolens, should be lukewarm.
      Now, just what do we mean by that? Well, if you have a thermometer make
      the water somewhere between 95&deg; and 105&deg;. This temperature feels
      just comfortably warm to your hands. s It is perfectly safe for woolens
since it does not draw out the natural oils in the woolen yarn.</p>
  <p> Bear in mind as you wash your woolen clothes that the temperature of every
    water bath you use must be the same&#8212;lukewarm. You may need to use two
soap baths if the garment is quite soiled and at least three rinse waters.</p>
<h3><a name="more" id="more"></a>The more suds the better.</h3>
  <p> Plenty of suds is necessary for washing wools, since heavy suds will act
        as a cushion between the surfaces of the woolen garment as you pat and
        squeeze it. The suds act as a lubricant and they also assist very greatly
  in floating out the dirt.</p>
  <p> Soap flakes usually make the best suds although a bar of soap may be
          dissolved and whisked into suds in a pan or bowl of very hot water,
    which, if course,
        must be reduced to the right temperature before the woolen garment is
    put in. If the water is at all hard, borax will help to soften it. If the
    water
        in your locality is very bad you had better add a little borax and soap
    to each rinse water also.</p>
  <p> Woolen garments may be washed by hand or in a washing machine but they
          should not be overcrowded. Do not try to wash too many garments at
    a time, and squeeze
      or agitate the garments in the sudsy bath only about fifteen minutes.</p>
  <p> As you take the garment from the water gather it up in your hands so
            as to prevent the weight of the wet garment fro pulling any part
    of it out
            of shape.
        Wools stretch so easily.</p>
<h3><a name="squeeze" id="squeeze"></a>This is the way we squeeze and dry.</h3>
  <p> Squeeze out the excess water gently with the hands or between the rollers
        in a wringer. Loosen the pressure of the rollers so that there is no
    danger of flattening down the fuzzy wool yarn. Get the moisture out by successive
        squeezing or trips through the wringer rather than attempting to get
    the
  water out all at once. Shake the garment back to fluffiness.</p>
  <p> Small pieces may be squeezed by hand but not twisted, then placed in
          a bath towel and the bath towel squeezed slightly to remove excess
    moisture.</p>
  <p> Sweaters and knitted wool articles should e dried flat on a table spread
          out to the original size and shape in accordance with the measurements
          you took before you washed the garment.</p>
  <p> Hang woven woolen garments like flannel jackets on hangers until partly
            dry. Move them about occasionally so that the water does not settle
            at the bottom.
            Colored flannels may develop a dark uneven color streak at the bottom
            if moisture is allowed to settle in the hems. Press flannel on the
            wrong side
            before the garment is entirely dry if you would preserve that new
    look.</p>
  <p> To dry blankets, place them on a long line out-of-doors if possible,
              and in the shade, or on a curtain stretcher. Hang the colored borders
              so that
              the stripes run perpendicular to the line. If there is any tendency
              for the colors to run they will not run into each other. Before
    the blankets
              are
              completely dry, shake them and fluff them up. Fluffy blankets are
              always warmer than flat ones.</p>
  <p> All we have said about smart ways to wash woolens may be summed
                up in the following rules.</p>
  <p>The rule of eleven.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>  Wash before very soiled.</li>
    <li> Choose a clear breezy day.</li>
    <li> Measure knit goods before wetting.</li>
    <li> Wash with mild soap containing no free alkali.</li>
    <li> Have water temperature between 95&deg; and 105&deg; F.</li>
    <li> Have wash and rinse waters same temperature.</li>
    <li> Rinse till last water is clear.</li>
    <li> Do not twist or wring between tight rolls.</li>
    <li> Shape and measure knit goods before drying.</li>
    <li> Dry quickly, but not in strong sun.</li>
    <li> Place in draught or use electric fan to dry indoors.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3><a name="if" id="if"></a>If you can see the spot, so can everyone else.</h3>
  <p> Did the little boy who sits back of Mary &quot;throw ink on her dress&quot;?
    Most certainly not, but somehow the ink spot got there. And what of the lettuce
    leave that came to life when your fork touched it and showered little spots
of French dressing on your new silk crepe blouse. Two of life's minor tragedies!</p>
  <p> Each stain is a problem in itself. There can be no universal stain remover.
      Each fiber, cotton, wool, silk, linen and rayon has a different chemical
      composition and reacts differently to commercial stain removers. A stain
  remover might be successful on some materials and destructive to others.</p>
<h3><a name="remove" id="remove"></a>To remove ink stains.</h3>
  <p> Let us explain how easily writing ink can be removed by the Delineator
    Home Institute method. It has been used successfully not only on white materials
        but on colored ones as well. This, however, depends on the character
    of
      the dye. Experiment first, on a part of the garment which does not show.</p>
  <p> You need a small bottle of hydrogen peroxide and an ounce or two of oxalic
        acid crystals. Use the peroxide full strength but dissolve on level tablespoon
        of oxalic acid crystal in a cup of water. Now, a word of caution: dissolved
        oxalic acid looks just like clear water and it has no odor but it is
    a deadly poison. So put the solution in a small bottle, label it plainly,
          and keep
        it well out of reach on a high shelf.</p>
  <p> Now, put the tea kettle on to boil. Then wash or sponge the ink stain
          with soapy water. Use a medicine dropper, glass rod or orange wood
    stick and
          drop on the spot a few drops of hydrogen peroxide; a drop or two at
    a time is
          enough. Use your peroxide sparingly if the garment is colored. Hold
    the stain close to the steam at the spout of the boiling tea kettle. You
          will notice
          the dark color of the ink spot begin to fade out to a dirty yellow.
    Use more peroxide and steam until the spot becomes a clear faint yellow.</p>
  <p> Now rinse the steamed spot in warm water and touch with a drop or two
            of the dissolved oxalic acid. The yellow stain will probably disappear
            but
            if it shouldn't immediately, hold it for a moment in the steam. Be
            careful not
            to steam more than a second or two after the oxalic acid has been
    used because the combination of heat and oxalic acid may destroy the fabric.</p>
  <h3><a name="succeed" id="succeed"></a>If at first you don't succeed.</h3>
  <p> If you notice a faint blue spot appearing when the oxalic is applied, that
        shows that the first treatment with peroxide was not complete, so you
    had better repeat the treatment with peroxide again. The final treatment
    with
        oxalic will then be successful. Finally, the spot being entirely removed,
        rinse the moist part of your garment thoroughly through several waters.</p>
<h3><a name="demon" id="demon"></a>And now to route the demon grease spot.</h3>
  <p> Success in removing these spots without leaving any suggestion of a ring
        depends more on skill and technique in handling the fabric than upon
    the virtues of the grease solvent or commercial stain remover. There are
    a
        number of good preparations on the market for removing grease. The trick
        is not so much to remove the spot as to do it without leaving rings,
    smudges or an area that looks too clean for the rest of the garment. It can
    be
        done successfully, however, or if a slight contrast between the cleaned
        place and the rest of the garment is noticeable that probably is better
than a decidedly dirty spot or stain on the dress.</p>
  <p> Grease solvents will evaporate from cloth very quickly but grease will
          not, and even when it is floated out of the spot it will show up in
    the fabric
        after the stain remover has evaporated unless it is taken up by some
    absorbent material used under the stained garment while it was in solution
    in the
          stain remover. Part of the grease is taken up by the sponging cloth
    with which
        you apply the grease remover but a folded absorbent cloth should be placed
        under the place you are sponging to act as a wick to draw up and absorb
the grease and the grease solvent.</p>
  <p> Another equally important point is to use your stain remover sparingly
          and if necessary, repeat the operation rather than squeeze cleaning
    fluid from
          the sponging cloth on to the material. In other words, persistent,
    very light sponging, with a slightly moistened cloth is much better than
    wet
          and drippy
          applications. The stroking, sponging motion should be carried over
    the spot and gradually out from the spot into the clean part of the garment
          on all
sides.</p>

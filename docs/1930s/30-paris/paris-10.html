</p>
  <p>Our Paris clothes when made by our own hands can, and should, have the real
    French touch that marks the finest custom-made article. The details and finesse
    shown in the finishing used both on the inside and outside of your dress
    are what give it the distinction which lifts it out of the amateur class.
    Under no circumstances must your dress suggest a copy of a cheap ready-made.
    Finishing, done either by hand or by machine, should never show. Seams should
    be sleekly flat and unnoticeable and all sewing should have that light, fresh &quot;rehandled&quot; appearance
    suggestive of the deftness and sureness of touch which comes with care and
    practice.</p>
<h3><a name="turn" id="turn"></a>Turn a French frock inside out.</h3>
  <p> The insides of French frocks speak volumes which never can be read in any
        book. Notice the seams, for instance. A seam is stitched for firmness,
        pressed open apparently while the dress is being put together, not after
        it is done, and then the edges finished rather casually with overcasting
        or picked in tiny points if the material does not fray. Let us stress
    again the matter of pressing seams as you make the dress. A wealth of French
        chic is produced by having just the right pressing habits. Use the selvedges
        of your cloth wherever possible. Good dressmakers often use it on the
    right
        side of the garment when it is decorative and as a finish on the wrong
        side wherever they can.</p>
  <p> Observe hems on good dresses. Did you ever see a fine custom-made dress
          with a hem sewed by machine? Of course not, it just isn't done, that's
          all!</p>
<h3><a name="etiquette" id="etiquette"></a>The etiquette of seam binding.</h3>
  <p> Inside edges of hems may have a tape or seam binding stitched flat against
        the edge (do not bind this edge, your hem will show a ridge). This flat
  tape should then be slip-stitched to the dress by hand.</p>
  <p> When you finish a neckline or the bottom of the skirt with a binding,
          sew the binding on the seam allowance line firmly with machine stitching
          but
        do the second sewing of the binding on the wrong side of the garment
    by hand with close even hemming stitches.</p>
  <p> You may have noticed three rows of machine stitching set close together
          on a narrow hem at the bottom of flared skirts of silk or wool. This
            is a decorative
          touch which is permissible if the stitching is accurately spaced and
            the stitch itself medium or smaller.</p>
<h3><a name="lingerie" id="lingerie"></a>Lingerie touches must be dainty.</h3>
  <p> Lingerie touches on dresses should be of the very finest and should be
    sewed in as carefully after each washing as though you expected them to be
    attached
        indefinitely. Carelessly basted-in neck and cuff frills can give a hit-or-miss,
        ungroomed look to one's whole costume.</p>
  <p> Let us also resort to a French trick to forever end that hitching-up-the-shoulder-strap
        habit. Sew a tiny little strap inside your dress on the shoulder seam.
          This little stay you slip under your assortment of shoulder straps
    and snap against
        your shoulder seam. The slipping and sliding pink ribbon no longer tumbles
        down your arm but sets firmly on the top of your shoulder where it was
          always intended to be.</p>
  <h3><a href="paris-illus/p-052.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',641,759);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-052-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 52" width="140" height="165" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a><a name="construction" id="construction"></a>Construction with the Deltor is as simple as counting.</h3>
  <p> The Deltor is the expert dressmaker's plan of procedure told in consecutive
        pictures. It is direct, it is quick, and it is sure. The beginner need
  do no experimenting with even her first dress.</p>
  <p> If you want to get the full value of your Deltor you will, after you
          have used the layout side, turn it over and follow the illustrations
          step by step
        which make the construction easily understood and carry you on without
    delay from the first basting to the last adjusting of the belt or bow.</p>
  <p> If you have never made dresses with the help of a Deltor, read on and
            follow through the construction directions in this one. Each step
    in the construction
          of this frock has been carefully worked out by an expert dressmaker,
            accurately sketched, and arranged in step-by-step order in vertical
            columns. See how
          clearly the pictures show how to crease on the line of small perforations
          and bring the crease over to the line of large perforations; how to
    make the plaits in the front of the bodice; how to crease and stitch the
    tiny
      tucks of the neckline in the back.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><a href="paris-illus/p-053.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',524,814);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-053-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 53" width="140" height="134" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a><a name="each" id="each"></a>Each Butterick pattern has its own Deltor.</h3>
  <p> This Deltor was especially made for the Butterick frock pattern which it
        illustrates. Every Butterick pattern you buy will include a Deltor made
  especially for that pattern.</p>
  <p> You are now working with the actual dress material, using tailor's tacks
        to guide you instead of perforations in tissue paper. The large perforations
        have been marked in one color thread and the small perforations with
    a different color thread. The first illustration shows you how easy it
          is to put your
        dress together. You could not possibly turn your plaits in the wrong
    direction with this picture to look at.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><a href="paris-illus/p-054.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',629,814);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-054-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 54" width="140" height="156" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a><a name="time" id="time"></a>Time to take steps.</h3>
  <p> Steps one and two, the Deltor says, should be taken before you baste the
        back and front of your dress together. After fitting, the seams of your
        dress are to be stitched and pressed open. Two ways of finishing the
    seams are suggested, one for wash materials, the other for silks and woolens.</p>
  <p> You should follow all these suggestions implicitly. Every Deltor includes
      complete directions for putting the garment together in every suggested
    fabric.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"> <a name="custom" id="custom"></a>Dressmaking<a href="paris-illus/p-055.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',663,509);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-055-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 55" width="140" height="237" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a> in the custom made manner.</h3>
  <p> Step three on this Deltor shows you how to lay the plaits in the flounce
      and how to put it together.</p>
  <p> Your tailor's tacks are there to show you where to fold plaits, and where
        to make outside stitching. This stitching, you note, is to run down on
        each plait as far as the second perforation from the top.</p>
  <p> The Deltor has, at this point, something to say about finishing your
            hem. Again two methods are described, as was true of seam finishes,
            one for
          woolen materials and another for other fabrics.</p>
  <p> If your dress is made of woolen material the Deltor directs you to
            cover the raw edge of your hem with seam binding. If the material
    is flat crepe
            or a similar light-weight fabric, the Deltor suggests that you turn
            in the raw edge of the hem, stitch close to the turned edge, and
    clip the
            joining
            in the underfold of the plait at the top of the hem. In both cases,
            whether the dress is of wool or silk, the hem is sewed to the dress
            with blind
            hemming done by hand, of course.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><a name="length" id="length"></a>The Deltor assures fashion-right length.</h3>
  <p> The Deltor tells you how deep to make your hem (in this case 4 3/8 inches)
        to achieve the fashion-right length for your dress. Your own individual
        height as well as fashion, does, of course, determine to some extent
    the length you wear your dresses. You should check the finished back length
        of your new dress which is stated on the back of the pattern envelope
    with
        the finished back length of one of your own most becoming dresses. You
        should then vary the depth of your hem as much as is necessary to insure
        a becoming length as well as a fashionable one.</p>
<h3><a name="expert" id="expert"></a>Be an expert the first time.</h3>
  <p> An impossible ideal? Not at all. You have a Deltor as your constant companion...
        helpful, dependable, and equal to any dressmaking emergency. Seemingly
        unimportant features like length of skirt or finish of hem may be just
        the trifling details which keep your dress from looking like Paris. But
        this need not happen to you, for the Deltor surely prevents you from
  making the smallest dressmaking error.</p>
  <p> It matters not whether you are making a warm wooly coat with a fur collar
        or a filmy chiffon evening gown, the Deltor made especially for either
          garment will make the process of construction a pleasure. You have
    the added assurance
        that your coat or dress will have the distinction of line and beauty
    of finish that is characteristic of all good clothes.</p>
  <p> You will never experience that unpleasant sensation of wishing to back
          into corners or walk on the shady side of the street because your costume
          is less
      than a perfect creation.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><a href="paris-illus/p-056.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',588,816);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-056-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 56" width="140" height="130" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a><a name="neck" id="neck"></a>Neck finishes: so simple when done correctly, so tell-tale when done wrong.</h3>
  <p> Step four of this Deltor shows you how to finish the neck edge, and also
        the armhole, should you be making the sleeveless view. The description
        gives you a choice of finishes for both light weight and heavy materials.
        You are also shown the way to apply both single binding and double binding,
        information which you, with your passion for perfection in finishings,
        will be very glad to have.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><a href="paris-illus/p-057.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',643,807);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-057-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 57" width="140" height="156" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a><a name="sleeves" id="sleeves"></a>Perfection in sleeves.</h3>
  <p> You have now reached the moment when it is time to make and put in your
    sleeve. Step five on the Deltor tells you just what to do. The illustration
    shows
        you the let-out seam which you have marked with tailor's tacks and the
        little place at the elbow where you will put in gatherings to give the
  necessary ease.</p>
  <p> And now let us call your attention to a little French trick. When using
          woolen materials clip the seam that holds the sleeve to the armhole
    at the notches
        in the sleeve. Then press this seam open across the top curve of the
    armhole. This gives a smooth flat curve. This kind of pressing is done over
    a tailor's
    cushion.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><a href="paris-illus/p-058.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',636,804);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-058-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 58" width="140" height="141" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a><a name="details" id="details"></a>Dressmaker details for dressmaker touches.</h3>
  <p> Step six of the Deltor shows you what to do to make the smart little bow
        effects on the front of the blouse and sleeves. These are cut according
        to Deltor directions using two of the pattern pieces, and carefully finished
        by hand.</p>

          there is little strain. Running stitches are short. Only two or three
          threads of
        the material are taken up on the needle at once before pulling the needle
        out of the material.</p>
  <p> Backstitching is used to make a firmer seam where there may be strain.
          Take a short stitch back of the end of thread showing on the right
    side of the
          seam and carry the needle forward on the under side bringing it up
    ahead of the end of thread. For each new stitch, put in the needle where
    the
          last stitch ended.</p>
  <p> There is a half backstitch which makes a seam firmer than a run seam
            and not so firm as a backstitched seam. Carry the needle only half
            way back
            instead of all the way back as in the backstitch. This leaves small
            spaces between
            each stitch on the upper side of the seam. The illustration below
    shows you how.</p>
  <h3><a name="smooth" id="smooth"></a>Paris clothes have smooth seams.</h3>
  <p> Smooth, unpuckered, straight seams make a garment hang well. When sewing
        seams, keep both pieces smooth and flat, but be careful not to pull and
        stretch. Make the stitching even and keep an even tension on your sewing
        thread whether you are sewing by hand or by machine. Finally, press each
        seam carefully.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><a href="paris-illus/p-064.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',505,490);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-064-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 64" width="140" height="171" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a><a name="plain" id="plain"></a>Plain seams.</h3>
  <p> The simplest seam is the plain seam. Lay two pieces of the garment together,
        edges matching and sew in a straight line on the wrong side along the
    seam allowance line. When the material is closely woven and does not fray
    the
  edges of this seam may be notched or picked.</p>
  <p> Materials which fray should be French seamed except at armholes or on
          curves where the fitted line might be lost. Bulky materials should
    never be French
    seamed. The edges may be cast or bound.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><a name="two" id="two"></a>French seams are two faced.</h3>
  <p> This is the way to make a <a href="paris-illus/p-066.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',373,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-066-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 66" width="140" height="108" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>French <a href="paris-illus/p-065.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',513,672);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-065-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 65" width="140" height="136" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>seam. Baste the seam on the right side
    of the garment and sew one quarter of an inch outside of the seam allowance
      line. Trim off the edge of the seam to a scant 1/8&quot; from your sewing.
      Now turn the garment wrong side out and crease the seam on your sewing
      line. Baste a second time on the real seam line and sew. Be sure the raw
edges are all enclosed in the second seam.</p>
  <p> There is a variation of the French seam called a turned-in seam, or false
      French seam. Stitch a plain seam on the wrong side of the garment; turn
    raw edges of the seam in toward each other; and stitch together.</p>

  <p> Seam edges may sometimes be protected by binding them with bias pieces
    of cloth. One may use the prepared bias finishing that can be bought at the
        notion counter in most stores or one may cut her own bias binding from
        silk or sateen. If you wish to use the binder attachment on your sewing
        machine to bind the seam edges buy No. 5 flat prepared bias binding and
        insert it into the binder as directed in your sewing machine instruction
        book. If you are not using the sewing machine attachment, use bias strips
        one inch wide and stitch one edge to the seam one quarter of an inch
    from
        the edge of the seam. Turn the binding over the edge of the seam; stitch
        inside of first stitching.</p>

  <p> Straight seams may be bound with straight ribbon known as seam binding.
    Double this ribbon with one side a trifle narrower than the other and press
    this
        creased ribbon with a warm iron. Slip the folded binding ribbon over
    the edge of the seam with the slightly narrower side uppermost. Sew the binding
        to the seam with hand running or with machine stitching, catching both
    edges with one row of sewing. This is a dainty finish for silks.</p>

  <p> In sheer materials, baste as for any ordinary seam. Begin at the right

        under the roll, but not through it. (Ill. 69).</p>

    you and taking up only a few threads of each fold or from the top of each

    The stitch slants and is taken quite deep in the seam allowance. Trim the
    edges
        of the seam even before you start to sew and point the needle toward
    your left shoulder as you sew. Spaces between stitches are even. A number
    of
        stitches may be taken before the thread is drawn up. (Ill. 72).</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><a name="catchstitch" id="catchstitch"></a>Two ways to catch-stitch.</h3>
  <p> Catch-stitching is used to hold down seam edges against the inside of a
    garment to prevent fraying, and often to hold the edge of a hem to a dress
    with
        a very flat effect. It is always used on inside seams in flannel garments
        and often used at the top of hems in tweed skirts. Where used at the
    seam, both edges may be pressed in the same direction or they may be opened
    out
        and catch-stitched to the garment <a href="paris-illus/p-074.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',320,602);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-074-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 74" width="140" height="102" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>separately.<a href="paris-illus/p-073.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',386,600);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-073-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 73" width="140" height="118" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a> Illustration 73. The needle
        is usually pointed toward you as you sew and you work along the line
    of sewing traveling away from you.</p>
  <p> A quicker method of catch-stitching is shown you in illustration 74.
          This is not as strong as real catch stitching and is done from right

  <h3 class="clear"> <a name="power" id="power"></a>A power plant of your own</h3>
  <p> Your sewing machine will produce Paris clothes in record time&#8212;let
  it work for you.</p>
  <p> Of course, since you are doing dressmaking you have a sewing machine. You
    would be surprised to know that many people who own this valuable piece of
    sewing equipment have never learned how much of their sewing can be done
    on it. You are not one of those queer people we feel sure. Your machine,
    as you know, can be counted upon to do really remarkable things and save
  you hours of time and heaps of energy.</p>
  <p> Not only do you use your machine constantly for all possible kinds of sewing,
    but you care a lot about the quality of sewing your machine does. We regret
    to say that some people will accept from their machines puckered seams or
    an occasional skipped stitch or loose tension. This seems such a pity when
    a slight twist of a screw will adjust a sewing machine to the tension or
    size of stitch suited to whatever material one is working on. Why not have
  machine stitching beautiful to look at as well as strong?</p>
  <p> Your book of directions which comes with whatever make of machine you have
    is the best possible guide for you to use in familiarizing yourself with
    every little thing about your household pet. You will want to know where
    it should be oiled, how to replace the needle, how to wind and insert bobbins,
    adjust tension screws and last but not least, all the fascinating things
    that can be made by using those intricate looking bits of shiny steel&#8212;the
  attachments.</p>
  <p>  </p>
  <h3 class="clear"><a href="paris-illus/p-075.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',653,477);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-075-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 75" width="140" height="219" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a><a name="overwork" id="overwork"></a>You cannot overwork your sewing machine.</h3>
  <p> Since we have mentioned attachments, just notice how many there are, each
        designed to do a different thing for you, such as binders, hammers, rufflers,
        tuckers, braiders, quilters, etc. There is always a little book that
    comes with your machine which explains just how each is to be used and what
    you
        may expect of it. Practice using each one until you feel rather expert.
        They will help you produce many interesting effects on your clothes which
  you would despair of ever getting otherwise.</p>
  <p> You may want a few additional gadgets to make your sewing still easier
    such as a small electric light to fasten to the arm of your machine.</p>
  <p> In any case, study every word of your instruction book if you have
            not already done so, and practice up on a few of the adjustments
    and types
          of stitching
      about which you may still feel a little uncertain.</p>
<h3><a name="telephone" id="telephone"></a>When in doubt, telephone the &quot;company.&quot;</h3>
  <p> There may be a few details which need additional explanation. If so, just
        call up the office of the sewing machine company which makes your machine.
        They will always send you an instructor who will explain your machine
    to you or you may go to the nearest office and see your machine demonstrated
  and have your difficulties explained away.</p>
  <p> Your machine may be old, but do not treat it like a stepchild on that
          account. Give it the benefit of a good cleaning and oiling. Then check
          on its parts
    and adjustments as though it were a new machine.</p>
<h3><a name="faithful" id="faithful"></a>Faithful service rewards good care.</h3>
  <p> Whether your machine is old or new, it should have regular, systematic
care. It takes very little time and saves you many wasted hours later.</p>
  <p> For example, sewing machines that are used continuously require daily oiling
    and cleaning. If your machine is used only a few hours each day, a weekly
    oiling and cleaning should be sufficient. You should remove all loose dirt
like lint, dust and thread before you begin your oiling job.</p>
  <p> A word about bobbins&#8212;have plenty of them. They are cheap and it is
    a great saving of time to have bobbins wound with the different colored threads
you frequently use. Be sure you wind your bobbins evenly and not too full.</p>
  <p> Regulate the length of stitch on your machine for different types of material.
      For fine materials it is usually best to use a small stitch and a medium
  tension with a fine needle.</p>
<h3><a name="vexing" id="vexing"></a>The vexing matter of skirt lengths.</h3>
  <p> How long shall I make my skirt? How often have you asked that question,
    and quite rightly, too , since the lower edge of one's dress has so much
    to
        do with a smart appearance! Fashion, of course, has a great deal to say
        about the length we wear our dresses but becomingness should have just
        as much influence. Following fashionable skirt lengths to extremes is
  seldom a good policy for anyone.</p>
  <p> There may be some take-up in the length of one's dress during making
          and so some people like to allow one inch extra length in their planning
          to allow
        for this. You should, therefore, when possible mark the skirt length
    and turn your hem, after the sleeves are in the dress and the finishing is
    done, unless the Deltor dictates otherwise.</p>
  <p> Circular skirts and godets, since they are cut on the bias, will stretch
          more than straight skirts. The weight of the bias pieces themselves,
            pulls them down so skirts with these bias features should be hung
    up in the closet
          for a day or so and allowed to stretch before the skirt is hung and
    the hem turned.</p>
  <p> After the dress has hung for a while, if there are bias parts in the
            skirt such as godets, rip the seams that have bias edges and while
            the garment
            is still hanging let the bias edges drop as much as they will below
            the edges they were originally basted to. Let the godet fall naturally
            and
            baste the
        seams again. Then mark the skirt length and turn the hem.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><a href="paris-illus/p-076.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',653,347);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-076-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 76" width="120" height="255" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a><a name="hang" id="hang"></a>When you hang your skirts without help.</h3>
  <p> There are various ways of marking skirt lengths. When there is someone
    to help you, the line is obtained by measuring up the required distance from
        the floor and placing a row of pins in the skirt. You may wrap a piece
        of paper around the yardstick the number of inches from the end that
    you
        are hanging your skirt from the floor in order to make it easy to see
    the distance on the yardstick. If your dress has a circular back or front
    with
        the rest of the skirt cut on the straight, hang the circular part a little
        shorter than you hang the rest of the skirt so that if the circular part
    stretches it will not look longer.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><a name="measure" id="measure"></a>Take the measure of a table.</h3>
  <p> Suppose you do not have assistance, you must then depend on the inanimate
        objects in the room to help you out. Sidle up to a table the top of which
        comes just below your hipline. Stand against the edge of the table and
        put a row of pins in your dress where the table top touches your skirt,
    turning slowly and placing pins every two inches. Use nice sharp pins.</p>
  <p><a href="paris-illus/p-077.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',643,296);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-077-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 77" width="140" height="250" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>Now take off your dress. Measure from the floor to the table top and
          subtract from this measure the distance you want your skirt to be from
          the floor.
        Lay your dress on the table and with a yardstick measure this distance
          down from your line of pins at the hipline and put in a line of pins
          at the bottom
        of the skirt. For example, suppose the table top is 30 inches from the
          floor, and you want your finished skirt length to be 12 inches from
    the floor. Subtract
        12 inches from 30 inches which is 18 inches and measure 18 inches down
          the skirt from your row of pins. The last row of pins gives you your
          correct
      skirt length. Illustration 77.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><a name="yardstick" id="yardstick"></a>The yardstick again.</h3>
  <p> A yardstick will do the same thing for you if no table is convenient. Stand
        in front of a mirror, and with the stick upright on the floor, one end
        touching your skirt, place a pin where the top of the stick touches the
        garment. Now move the stick around your figure putting in pins at two
    inch intervals. Take the garment off and measure from the pins down to the
    correct
        length which you have previously determined by subtracting from the total
        length of the stick the number of inches you want your skirt to clear
    the floor.</p>
  <h3><a name="hemming" id="hemming"></a>The gentle art of hemming.</h3>
  <p> Now that your hemline is marked at a becoming fashion-right length from
    the floor, the next and most important step is turning it up. There is more
      that goes into the making of a smooth, non-puckering hem than meets the
      eye. The first consideration is to trim off the lower edge of your garment
      perfectly straight and even for the first turning. This first turning should
      be narrow&#8212;at the most not more than half an inch. The depth of the
      second turning depends on where the hem is used and the effect you want
      to give. The pattern gives you the correct depth far the design. The next
      consideration is to see that the second turning is the same depth its entire
      length. A little marker which you can make yourself is of great assistance
  in checking this width.</p>
  <p> Hems are easy to make the same width all around if you use a little cardboard
      marker to measure up from the bottom of your skirt. Cut a notch in your
    piece of cardboard the desired width of your hem.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a href="paris-illus/p-078.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',426,637);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-078-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 78" width="140" height="123" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a><a name="baste" id="baste"></a>Baste carefully.</h3>
  <p> When the hem is wide, you should baste once on the bottom fold of your
  skirt and again at the top of the hem.</p>
  <p> Hems in skirts are usually from two and one half to four inches finished
    unless some other depth is suggested in the pattern or in the Deltor.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><a name="gored" id="gored"></a>Hems for slightly gored or straight skirts.</h3>
  <p> The hem is turned up in the usual way described above. When an invisible
        sewing is desired the turned in edge at the top of the hem is stitched
        close to the turn but not to the skirt itself. This finished edge is
  then blind-stitched to the dress.</p>
  <p><a href="paris-illus/p-079.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',412,642);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-079-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 79" width="140" height="117" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>A straight hem may also be finished with ribbon seam binding on silk
          and wool materials. When the binding is used do not turn under the
    top edge of
        the hem but stitch the other edge of the flat seam binding to the skirt.
    (Illustration 79.)</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><a name="circular" id="circular"></a>Circular hems require special treatment.</h3>
  <p> In circular skirts or on godets when the material of the dress is soft,
    the raw edge of the hem may be turned in and a gathering thread put in close
        to the turning. Draw up this gathering thread until the top of the hem
        fits the skirt. Blindstitch this drawn up edge to the garment.</p>
  <h3><a name="wool" id="wool"></a>If your dress is wool.</h3>
  <p> Your dress may be made of heavy wool material. If that is the case do not
        turn in the raw edge before you run in the gathering thread. Draw up
    the top of the hem to fit the skirt. Then baste flat silk seam binding to
    the

          fullness. The piece of muslin will prevent the fullness in the hem
    from making pressing
        marks on the garment. Move the piece of muslin along in the hem as you
          press. After this pressing and shrinking has been done, remove the
    muslin and blindstitch

  <h3 class="clear"><a name="inconspicuous" id="inconspicuous"></a>Where stitches should be inconspicuous.</h3>
  <p> When sewing hems, train your eye to keep your small stitches an even distance
      apart. Do not make your stitches too close together or your hem will look
      too tight and &quot;sewed&quot; on the right side. The thread should be
      drawn up but not too tightly, since hems should seem to be sewed in rather
      a casual manner. It is easier to make your stitches inconspicuous if you
      sew with a fine needle and thread. Baste with silk thread when you sew
      on silk to avoid marking your fabric.</p>

        and slanting on the right side. We use it for hems in linen handkerchiefs
        or babies' dresses of fine cotton materials which are laundered constantly.
        Begin this stitch without a knot, pushing the little loose end of thread
        between the hem and the garment. Take a small stitch pointing your needle
        toward the left shoulder, taking up only a thread or two each time. Fasten
        off your sewing at the end of the hem with two or three over and over
    stitches. Examine carefully the detail of this stitch in illustration 81.</p>
  <h3><a name="knots" id="knots"></a>Remember, no knots.</h3>

    side running parallel to the weave of the material instead of slanting across
        it. It is practically invisible on the right side. The stitches are usually
        spaced farther apart than slanting hemming stitches. In making this stitch
        try to keep the needle as nearly parallel to the folded line of the hem
        as possible instead of pointing it toward the left shoulder. Pick up
    only
        two threads of the garment and as little of the hem as possible. The
    needle enters the hem fold slightly in front of the place where it leaves
    the
        garment. (See illustration 82 to the right above.)</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><a name="sophisticated" id="sophisticated"></a>Sophisticated hemming.</h3>
  <p> Slip-stitch and blind hemming are the two kinds of hemming which require
        a deft touch and nicely defined dressmaking judgment. They are used more
        often to give that casual Parisian touch to our clothes than the other
        two kinds of hemming described.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><a href="paris-illus/p-083.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',598,707);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-083-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 83" width="140" height="147" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a><a name="slip" id="slip"></a>Slip-stitch.</h3>
  <p> Slip-stitching is used when it is necessary to have Invisible sewing on
    both the right and wrong sides. The sewing is not strong but it is one of
    the
      most valuable stitches for finishing silk and wool garments. When making
      this stitch take up only one thread of the material on the needle, slip
      the needle through the under side of the fold and bring it out through
      the crease. This makes a stitch which is practically invisible. The stitches
      are spaced about 1/4&quot; apart, and sometimes 3/8&quot;.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a name="blind" id="blind"></a>Blind hemming.</h3>
<p> This makes a stitch which is virtually invisible on the right side but shows
        on the wrong side. It goes faster than slip-stitching and looks just
  about as well.</p>

          through the fold of the hem on the wrong side. This stitch is also
  used for hems
        and facings on silk and wool. In both these stitches take care not to
  draw up your thread too tightly. For detail of the correct blind stitching
  method
    examine illustration 84.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a name="true" id="true"></a>True bias is a smooth article.</h3>
<p> Bias strips used as facings and bindings both for trimming and finishing
        edges are constantly being used in all good dressmaking. We seldom complete
        a dress without cutting some bias finishing pieces. Bias may be bought
        already cut and sometimes folded also. Bias is more often, however, cut
        from material from which the dress is made. The way to find a true bias
        is described on page 46. Having found the true bias line, measure from
        it the width you expect to cut your bias strips. Mark as many lines all
  the same distance apart as you can and cut along these lines.</p>
<p><a href="paris-illus/p-085.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',461,449);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-085-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 85" width="140" height="157" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>When joining bias strips lay the straight end of the two pieces together
        with right sides toward each other. You will make a right angle with
  the strips. Extend the point of one piece beyond the other as far as the width
        of the joining seam. After these two pieces are stitched this way (Ill.
          85), when the seam is opened both bias pieces will be seamed diagonally;
          the bias
    edges will form a straight line.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a name="clever" id="clever"></a>A clever short cut.</h3>
<p> There is another very clever way<a href="paris-illus/p-087.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',315,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-087-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 87" width="140" height="116" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a> to cut<a href="paris-illus/p-086.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',401,680);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-086-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 86" width="140" height="117" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a> bias pieces from a tube of cloth
        in one continuous strip. Trim the material from which you expect to cut
        strips to a straight grain on all four sides. Now find the true bias
  line. Mark as many strips as can be cut from the whole piece and then cut off
        the triangular piece at one corner. Pin the two opposite edges of the
  whole
        piece together matching the marked lines. (Ill. 86.) Stitch this pinned
        seam. Begin at the bias end and cut, following the line around and around
        the tube as in illustration 87.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a name="bound" id="bound"></a>We are bound to like our necklines.</h3>
<p> The most attractive and suitable neckline finish is bias binding, either
        single or double. If the dress is of wool or heavy cotton use a single
        binding. Silks, chiffons and light weight cottons may be finished with
        double bindings since double binding stretches less and is easier to
  handle. The trick in putting on binding is to keep it from twisting as you
  sew
        it on.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a name="double" id="double"></a>Double binding is no trouble.</h3>
<p><a href="paris-illus/p-088.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',636,511);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-088-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 88" width="140" height="204" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>To make double binding, cut a bias strip four times as wide as the finished
      binding plus an allowance for a seam on each edge of the binding (usually
      1/2&quot; to 5/8&quot; extra). Now fold your long bias strip through the
      center and press the fold, but be careful not to stretch it on the ironing
      board. Baste and stitch the two raw edges of the binding to the right side
      of the edge of the neck that is to be bound. Sew on the seam allowance
      line and hold the binding toward you. Now roll the binding with a light
      deft touch to the inside of the dress and sew the creased edge of the binding
      to the outside of the dress. Do this sewing by hand with a straight hemming
      stitch. Illustration 88 on page 103 shows a double binding.</p>

<p> To make a single binding, cut bias strips twice the finished width plus an
        allowance for a seam on each edge of the binding. Stitch one edge of
  the binding to the right side of the dress with the two right sides together
        on the seam allowance line. The binding will be toward you. Roll the
  binding
        to the inside of the dress, turn under the seam allowance and sew to
  the line of stitching by hand. (Ill. 89.)</p>

<p> Straight edges may<a href="paris-illus/p-090.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',649,419);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-090-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 90" width="140" height="243" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a> be bound with any straight ribbon or braid but curved
        edges must always be bound with something that will stretch. Some straight
        looking military braid is woven in such a way that it stretches and shapes
        around curves very easily. To apply this kind of braid to a curved edge,
        fold it through the center and press the fold. Slip the curved edge you
        are binding between the edges of the braid, baste and stitch close to
  the edge of the braid. One stitching will hold both back and front. Dampening
        the braid along its edges sometimes makes it easier to shape to the curved
        edges of your dress. (Ill. 90.)</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a name="rescue" id="rescue"></a>Bias fold tape to the rescue again.</h3>
<p> If you are trimming your curved edges with bias fold tape, there are two
        ways you may attach it to the dress. The first way is just the same as
        we have just described for attaching military braid. <a href="paris-illus/p-091.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',390,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-091-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 91" width="140" height="115" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>The second way is
        to stitch one edge of the bias fold tape to the outside of your dress
  along the crease in the tape, holding the tape toward you. Then roll the rest
        of the tape to the inside of the dress and sew the other folded edge
  to
        the stitches that hold it to the outside of the dress. This is done by
        hand. (Examine Ill. 91.)</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a name="scalloped" id="scalloped"></a>Let us not hesitate to bind scalloped edges.</h3>
<p> One of the most attractive ways of finishing smart scalloped edges is by
        binding them, although we may face them if we wish. Sheer materials are
        particularly charming with the added weight of a double texture used
  along the edge. The most important thing is to keep the scallops symmetrical,
        the corners sharp and true, and the binding narrow and smooth.</p>

  of first sewing. (Ill. 94.)</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a name="facings" id="facings"></a>Face to face with facings.</h3>
<p> Facings are indispensable finishes. We rarely make a dress without making
        use of a facing or two somewhere on it. We sometimes remodel or lengthen
        a frock by using a facing instead of a hem at the bottom. A hem is to
  be preferred, however, since the seam which attaches the facing piece to the
        dress may show through if the material is at all thin or it may show
  a
      ridge in heavy fabric.</p>
<p> Facings may be applied in two ways. They may be sewed to the edge of
          the garment and then turned in toward the wrong side, or applied to
  the inside
        of the garment when the edge has been turned inside and pressed down.</p>
<p> A facing cut on the straight-lengthwise or straight-crosswise grain of
          the material may be used if the edge to be faced follows a straight
  grain.</p>
<p> If the edge to be faced is bias or slightly curved, bias facing must
            be used since it can be stretched on its outer edge to fit the larger
            circle.
            Press
            such a facing, shrinking the inner edge, and stretching the outer
  edge as you press.</p>

    as the part to be faced. They are used on edges which are curved or irregular
    in shape. (Illustration 95.) Facings are usually cut about one inch wide
    plus two seam allowances. A facing should stay inside the dress easily with
    the minimum amount of sewing on the inside edge. Sometimes we only tack the
    inside edge of a facing.</p>

When this is
    used turn under the edge to be faced and press it. If the edge is curved
    the
        seam allowance should be slashed so that the turned portion will lie
    flat. Sew the seam binding on the turned seam allowance easing the straight
    edge
        of the ribbon binding against the garment if the edge happens to be curved.
        Tack the free edge of the facing. (Ill. 97.)</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><a name="finishing" id="finishing"></a>Finishing slashed openings.</h3>
  <p> Slashed openings in blouses are often finished with facings. Attach the
    facing piece to the right side of the garment but do not cut the slash until
    facing
is sewed to the dress.</p>
  <p> <a href="paris-illus/p-096.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',527,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-096-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 96" width="140" height="120" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>The line of stitching which holds the facing to the slash must be perfectly
    straight, so rule a line from the neck to the bottom of the slash. Stitch,
    tapering the line of sewing from 3/8&quot; at the neck to 1/8&quot; at the
    point of the slash. Cut through the center almost to the point. Pull facing
    through to the wrong side and baste along the seam. Turn in the inside edge
    of the facing and stitch to itself, not to the garment. Tack at shoulder
seam and on corners. (Ill. 96.)</p>

  <p> Cut the bias facing piece 1 1/4&quot; to 1 1/2&quot; wide depending on the
    weight of the cord which it must cover. Sew one end of this piece to the
    end of a fine cord. Hold the cord nearer one edge of the bias than the other.
    Fold the bias facing over the cord and sew it into the facing with running
    stitches. Be sure not to catch the cord. Baste the corded facing flat to
    the turned in edge of the dress and slipstitch the facing into place. Examine
illustration 98.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><a name="buttonholes" id="buttonholes"></a>Be firm with your buttonholes.</h3>
  <p> Be very careful not to spoil the effect of your beautifully made garment
        with badly made buttonholes. A little preparation for the buttonhole
    before it is cut will assist you a great deal in making a good buttonhole
    later.
        Mark the place where you intend to make it before you cut; if you plan
        to make a row of buttonholes, mark the position of the two ends of your
        row with two lines of bastings. Then divide the space into the desired
        number of holes and mark where each slit will come with a cross line
    of basting. Always cut the slit for a buttonhole on a straight thread of
    the
        material if possible. The cut should be long enough to let the button
    slip through easily. Buttonholes become tighter after they are worked.</p>
  <h3><a name="scissors" id="scissors"></a>The right scissors mean a lot.</h3>
  <p> You should use buttonhole scissors in order to make a clean cut with one
        stroke. A buttonhole with an uneven or ragged edge is doomed to be a
    bad one from the start. Buttonholes are almost invariably worked over two
    thicknesses
        of material. To prevent either one of the thicknesses of material from
        slipping, you should baste, or better still, run several rows of machine
        stitching around the mark for the slit before cutting. This machine stitching
        is absolutely necessary in loosely woven materials that may ravel since
        it gives a good firm edge to the finished buttonhole.</p>
<h3><a name="buttonhole" id="buttonhole"></a>The kind of buttonhole depends upon its position.</h3>
  <p> Buttonholes are sometimes placed vertically as in the center plait of a
    blouse or shirt, or placed horizontally as in cuffs or on the front of a
    coat.
        Where the buttonhole is in an upright position there is no strain on
    the ends so we make one with a bar finish at both ends. Horizontal buttonholes
        usually have a button straining against one end. In that case we use
    a
        fan on the end where the button rests and a bar at the other end.</p>
  <p><a href="paris-illus/p-099.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',435,428);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-099-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 99" width="140" height="168" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>To strengthen buttonholes before working them strand each side. Bring the
    needle up from the wrong side at one end; allow the thread to lie along the
    edge of the cut on the right side of the garment; make a small stitch on
    the wrong side at the other end, and carry a strand of thread along the other
    edge of the cut. This makes a firm foundation.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><a name="special" id="special"></a>A special technique for worked buttonholes.</h3>
  <p> Now you are ready to make your buttonhole with the buttonhole stitch. Begin
        to work close to the corner which is to be finished with a bar. As you
        work place the buttonhole over the forefinger of the<a href="paris-illus/p-100.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',478,456);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-100-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 100" width="140" height="184" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a> left hand holding
        it in position with the thumb and second finger. Insert the needle and
        while it is pointing toward you, bring the double thread as it hangs
    from the eye of the needle around under the point of the needle from right
    to
        left. Draw the needle through the material and through this loop at the
        same time drawing up the purl or little knot exactly on the edge of the
        slit. Continue these buttonhole stitches to the opposite end if you are
        making a buttonhole with a fan at one end. Be careful to make all the
    stitches the same depth and close together excepting at the fan end.</p>
  <h3 class="clear">  <a name="barred" id="barred"></a>The double barred buttonhole.</h3>
  <p> To make a double barred buttonhole, when you have reached the end opposite
    your starting point, pass the needle up and down through the material until
    three threads<a href="paris-illus/p-102.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',401,499);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-102-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 102" width="140" height="145" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a> cross the <a href="paris-illus/p-101.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',413,496);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-101-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 101" width="140" height="159" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>end
    of the slit close to the last buttonhole stitch. Turn the work around so
    that the bar end is toward you and make several buttonhole
    stitches over the bar and through the material. Now work the other side and
    the other bar.  </p>
  <p>For a fan end buttonhole spread your stitches and use an uneven number of
    stitches around the fan so that the center stitch will be on a straight line
    with the slit. The other stitches will slant toward the edge of the buttonhole.
    After the fan is made at the outer end of the buttonhole, work the other
    side and finish the inner end with a bar.</p>

        with the exception of very sheer chiffons and fine batistes. They add
    greatly to the distinctive appearance of a gown when the binding is narrow
    and
        they are expertly made. The binding for the buttonholes is usually made
        of the same material as the garment but occasionally for highly decorative
        effects, the binding may be made in a contrasting color, and sometimes
        a contrasting fabric.</p>
  <p>There are two ways of binding a buttonhole, but in either case the position
    and length of the buttonhole should be marked on the garment with basting.</p>

  together. Stitch 1/8&quot; from each side of the mark and straight across the

      the wrong side of the garment. Press the buttonhole.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><a name="coats" id="coats"></a>Buttonholes for coats.</h3>
  <p> Where fronts of the garments are finished with facings, as in coats, baste
      the facing flat against the garment about an inch from the bound buttonhole.
      Cut a straight line in the facing to correspond with the buttonhole. Turn
    in the edges of the facing and slipstitch these turned-in edges.</p>
  <p> Either one of these methods may be used wherever slashes occur on a garment,

  <p> With the suit returned to fashion with its accompanying tuck-in blouse,
    plackets for skirts and sleeves have again become the order of the day. Openings
      in skirts and sleeves must rest flat against the figure with no bulging,
  straining snappers visible.</p>
  <p> Plackets may be finished with a continuous straight strip of material or
    they may require two separate pieces&#8212;one used as an extension on the
    under side of the closing and one used as a facing on the upper side of the
  closing.</p>
  <p> The continuous finish is often called a bound placket and the two piece
    finish is often called a faced placket. But however you bind them, make them
    perfect.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><a name="continuous" id="continuous"></a>Continuous <a href="paris-illus/p-113.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',535,396);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-113-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 113" width="140" height="215" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>plackets <a href="paris-illus/p-112.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',545,391);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-112-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 112" width="140" height="222" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>present no problem.</h3>
  <p> A continuous placket is often used at slashed openings or on seam openings
      at the bottom of sleeves. Cut a straight strip of material twice the length
      of the opening and twice the width of the finished underlap (usually 1/4&quot; to
      3/8&quot; is wide enough for a finished underlap) plus 3/8&quot; on each
      long edge of the placket strip for seams. When attaching this placket piece
      to a slashed opening, be very careful to lay the right side of the lap
      to the right side of the sleeve and stitch a seam running the seam to a
      point at the top of the slash. Then turn the free edge of the lap or placket
      piece toward the inside of the sleeve, turn in the seam allowance and hem
      to the line of machine stitching. When this kind of placket is attached
      at a seam, slash the seam allowance of the sleeve where the placket piece
      is stitched around the top of the opening. It will then be possible to
keep the placket flat when it is tucked into the sleeve opening.</p>
  <p> The placket closing must lie flat at all times so be sure to sew on enough
      snaps or buttons to keep the opening from gaping. Snaps should be sewed
    on behind the edge of the seam so that there will be no danger of their showing.</p>
  <h3><a name="dresses" id="dresses"></a>Now dresses are fitted.</h3>
  <p> They are not just little two piece over-blouse affairs. Almost everything
        requires more fitting. Sleeves fit smoothly at the wrists and skirts
    mold waist and hips. We have waist bands with us again which makes a placket
        opening necessary in either a suit skirt or one piece dress. You will
    want
        to know how to make these placket closings narrow, smooth, and invisible
        from the right side.</p>
  <h3><a name="snug" id="snug"></a>A flat, snug skirt closing.</h3>
  <p class="clear"> The <a href="paris-illus/p-116.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',595,450);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-116-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 116" width="140" height="212" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>closing <a href="paris-illus/p-115.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',554,401);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-115-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 115" width="140" height="223" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>in a skirt<a href="paris-illus/p-114.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,397);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-114-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 114" width="140" height="241" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a> must be deep enough to allow the garment to slip
    over the shoulders easily. This opening is usually placed on the left hand
    side
        seam of the skirt but the design of the skirt regulates, to some extent,
        the position and finish of the opening. The closing may be fastened with
        hooks and eyes, snaps, or blind loops. The fastening of the belting at
        the waist line is usually done with hooks and eyes regardless of what
    is used below to close the placket.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><a name="facedplacket" id="facedplacket"></a>This is the way to make a faced placket.</h3>
  <p> The faced placket which is made at a seam using two extra pieces of material
        is done as follows. Cut a facing piece for the upper side of the closing,
        of the same material as the garment, if the dress is of silk or light
    weight wool or cotton material. For a heavy woolen garment cut a facing piece
        from matching silk. Stitch this facing piece to the seam allowance of
    the
        skirt holding the right side of facing against right side of skirt and
        making the seam a little outside the actual seam allowance line so that
        the facing will not show as it is folded against the inside of the skirt.
        This facing piece may also be sewed by hand or machine flat to the turned-under
        seam allowance, if preferred. The inner edge of the facing may be tacked
        occasionally to the inside of the skirt.</p>
<h3><a name="strong" id="strong"></a>Make placket strong with machine stitching.</h3>
  <p> To make the extension on the underlap of the opening, sew a double piece
        of material an inch and a half wide, finished, to the extended seam allowance
  of the skirt with a row of machine stitching.</p>
  <p> The placket should then be pinned together, the skirt turned wrong side
          out, the seam allowance of the skirt slashed at the base of the placket,
          and the
        extension of the placket stitched to the facing of the placket at its
    base. The raw edges of these placket pieces may then be overcast together
    or
          pinked.</p>
  <p> Where there is a fold or plait in the skirt make a placket by cutting
            through the crease or under fold.</p>
  <h3><a name="abuse" id="abuse"></a>Machine hemstitching: its use and abuse.</h3>
  <p> Machine hemstitching is a very valuable aid to good dressmaking and was
    originally brought to us from France to show us dainty and flat ways of finishing
        linings and fluttering edges in soft materials. It may be used to put
    together
        seams, to finish the inside of seams, and to finish free edges in light
        weight materials. It is occasionally used in decorative shapes and lines,
  but this use is in bad taste. When in doubt consult the Deltor.</p>
  <p> It is done on a special machine carrying two spools of sewing silk at
          a time and can be done at small expense where plaiting and button covering
          is done
    or at the salesrooms of the sewing machine companies.</p>
  <p> The line which the hemstitch machine operator must follow should be marked
          with basting, using the same color thread you expect to have used for
          the machine hemstitching. Where the hemstitched line is to be made
    along a
          straight edge, you need not mark with basting. Tell the operator how
          far back from
      the edge of the garment to make her line of hemstitching.</p>
  <h3><a name="before" id="before"></a>Hemstitch before you seam.</h3>
  <p> If you expect to have much hemstitching done on the garment try to arrange
        to have it done before the seams of the dress are all sewed. It is easier
        to work on pieces of fabric that can be laid out as flat as possible
    while the stitching is being done.</p>
<h3><a name="hemstitchedseams" id="hemstitchedseams"></a>Hemstitched seams.</h3>
  <p> Occasionally you may want the seams of a blouse made with hemstitching.
    This introduces an open work line on shoulders and around armholes. This
    use
        of hemstitching is, however, no longer considered in the best possible
        style. If you should, for any reason, want the seams sewed this way,
    baste the seams flat, that is with one seam allowance folded back against
    the
        garment, and this fold laid on the sewing line of the seam allowance
    of the other piece.</p>
  <p class="clear"> <a href="paris-illus/p-118.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',655,273);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-118-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 118" width="140" height="253" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>A very satisfactory use for hemstitching is to stitch the seam together
    with hemstitching like any plain seam on the wrong side of the garment and
    trim
  the seam allowance to the stitching. (Ill. 118.)</p>
  <p>  Where edges to be machine hemstitched are bias and the material is thin,
      a foundation under the fabric may be necessary. Mousseline de soie, fine
      lawn or even tissue paper may be basted under chiffon, lace, or georgette
      before taking it to the hemstitchers. Be sure your foundation strips are
      cut on the straight and are at least one half inch wide. If none of these
      foundation materials are available, stitch the bias line to a piece of
        firm paper. This will stay the material and mark the line. Tear the paper
        away
      before taking the material to the operator.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><a href="paris-illus/p-117.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',428,602);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-117-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 117" width="140" height="142" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a><a name="picot" id="picot"></a>The mystery of picot edges.</h3>
  <p> Picot edging is machine hemstitching cut thru the middle of the hemstitching
        holes. (Ill. 117.) It makes a dainty finish for thin materials on flounces,
        collars, plaited ruffles, frills, etc. Do not use a picot edge on a collarless
        neckline. It does not hold its shape well enough and always looks inadequate.</p>
  <h3><a name="touch" id="touch"></a>That Paris touch with hand hemstitching.</h3>
  <p> Hand hemstitching is really decorative when used in fine, well spaced lines
      and gives an added touch of French preciousness to fine lingerie trimmings.</p>
  <p> It is simply a line of open work made by drawing out a succession of
          parallel threads and then fastening the cross threads in successive
    small clusters.</p>
  <p> Hand hemstitching may be used as a simple line of decoration or it
            may be used to hold hems or tucks in the garment. It can, of course,
            only be
          worked
          on the straight lengthwise or crosswise threads of the cloth, but these
          lines can be crossed to make corner or checker-board effects.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><a name="way" id="way"></a>Hemstitch this way.</h3>
  <p class="clear"> <a href="paris-illus/p-119.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',525,533);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-119-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 119" width="140" height="170" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>The hemstitching stitch may be done from left to right or from right to
    left. The first way is probably the more usual since we usually sew hems
    that
        way also. When using it to hold a hem, insert the needle in the fold
    of the hem at the left hand edge. Hold the work over the forefinger of the
        left hand, keeping the thumb over the thread. Take up four or five threads
        on the needle and draw it through, holding the sewing thread firmly with
        the left thumb. At the extreme right of the gathered-up group of cross
        threads take a short stitch in the fold of the hem as shown in illustration
        119, and draw the thread through. Take up the same number of threads
    in
  each group and continue to secure these grouped threads to the hem.</p>
  <p class="clear"> <a href="paris-illus/p-120.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',536,507);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-120-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 120" width="140" height="179" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>Hems may be finished by double hemstitching which simply means that one
          works a row of hemstitching on both sides of the drawn thread space.
          The second
        row of hemstitching has a small stitch between groups sewed through the
          edge of the single material instead of through the fold of the hem.
    See illustration
    120.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><a name="varieties" id="varieties"></a>Hand hemstitching has distinction in varieties.</h3>
  <p> There is a very decorative type of hemstitching called serpentine or fagot
        hemstitching. It gives a triangular or vine-like effect to the open-work
        line which is very decorative.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><a href="paris-illus/p-122.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',497,485);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-122-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 122" width="140" height="176" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a><a name="fagothem" id="fagothem"></a>Fagot hemstitching.</h3>
  <p> Fagot hemstitching is made like double hemstitching except that in the
    second row half the threads of one cluster and half the threads of the next
    cluster
        are combined in one group. This gives a slanting or serpentine effect
    to the drawn work. See illustration 122. For this type of hemstitching, the
        groups must contain an even number of threads so that they can be divided
        evenly when the second row of sewing is made. A symmetrical effect and
        perfection of detail is the charm of this hand work. Take your time.
    Needle
        work will not be hurried. Better none at all than hemstitching carelessly
        done.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><a name="picoted" id="picoted"></a>Picoted plaitings for that feminine touch.</h3>
  <p> <a href="paris-illus/p-123.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',656,467);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-123-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 123" width="140" height="222" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>Plaited frills cut on the straight of the material are very easily and
    quickly made with the aid of machine hemstitching and the plaiting machine.
    To
      prepare your strips, first baste a line 3/8&quot; from one straight edge
      of the fabric; make parallel rows of basting 1 5/8&quot; apart. Baste with
      thread which matches the material to be hemstitched so that the basting
      need not be removed after the hemstitching is done. Machine hemstitch on
      every other row of basting. Press and cut through the center of the hemstitching
      to make the picot edge. Cut also along the basted line which is not hemstitched.
      This makes a plaiting about 7/8&quot; to 1&quot; wide, finished and attached
      to the garment. If your material is not too thin, these lines can be marked
      by drawing out a single thread of the material instead of putting in lines
of basting. See illustration 123 on this page.</p>
  <p> Make as many strips as you need and join them with a narrow French seam.
    Have 1/4&quot;, or even narrower, plaits put in. Allow three times as much
    material as you will need since two thirds of it will be taken up in the
plaiting.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><a href="paris-illus/p-121.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',505,610);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-121-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 121" width="140" height="148" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a><a name="attach" id="attach"></a>It is easy to attach.</h3>
  <p> To attach this plaiting to collars or cuffs baste the frill to the edge
    of the collar as you would for a plain seam and have the seam picoted. Then
        turn the frill upright and press the sewing line flat against the collar.
    (Illustration 121.)</p>
  <p> Still another use of the picot finish for fine materials is to turn the
          picot edge back against the wrong side of the garment. Then stitch
    this turned
        edge flat on the right side of the garment and close to the turn. This
          is often used at the bottom of circular godets and on the sides of
    panels. It
      is also used on chiffons, hemmed by hand, instead of by machine.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a name="fagot" id="fagot"></a>Fagot-stitch for that open work touch.</h3>
  <p> The popularity of fagoting as a decorative feature on clothes waxes and
    wanes. At present we see some of it used with restraint, usually at necklines
or for shallow yokes.</p>
  <p> Where a fitted shaping is required as in a yoke, a pattern should be
          cut from stiff paper and the bias folds of the fabrics which are to
    be faggoted
        together basted to the paper the proper distance apart, following the
shape of the edge line.    </p>
  <p class="clear"><a href="paris-illus/p-124.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',652,392);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-124-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 124" width="138" height="253" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>The simple fagot-stitch is done by crossing the space between the bias folds
    of material first from the left to the right taking a small stitch in upper
    fold and then in the lower fold. The sewing crosses back and forth between
    the bands, the needle each time passing under the thread of the preceding
    stitch. This makes a little twist close to the edge of the material. (Illustration
    124.) The secret of success with this stitch is to space the stitches evenly
    in both upper and lower rows and place them close enough together so that
    the effect is firm and lacy rather than loose and spidery. There are several
    variations of this simple fagot stitch. The Deltor shows you where to use
    fagoting.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><a name="children" id="children"></a>Double-overcasting for the children's clothes.</h3>
  <p> Another hand finish which is easily as well as quickly done is double-overcasting.
        This is often used to finish edges on children's clothes or on smocked
        blouses. The overcasting is done over a one-eighth of an inch hem. Hold
        this basted hem loosely in the left hand. Fasten the end of the thread
        at the right hand end of the work and overcast over the hem working toward
        the left. When the entire edge is overcast, turn the work and overcast
        in the opposite direction, inserting the needle at the base of each stitch
        in the first row of overcasting. This forms a cross on the edge of the
        hem.</p>

  <p> A variation of double-overcasting is called cross double-overcasting and
    shows the cross between the top and bottom of the hem instead of along the
    edge fold
    of the hem. The first row of overcasting is done in the usual way, but in
    the second row the needle is inserted half way between the stitches of the
    first
row. See illustration 125.  </p>
  <p class="clear">Blanket-stitch is a useful stitch on children's clothes and may be worked
    in any heavy rope thread. Make the stitch from left to right. Secure the

    take a stitch the depth required pointing the needle straight toward you
    and bring it out under the edge of the garment and over the held down end

  <p> Cross-stitch, French-knots, braiding, beading, etc., are worked from transfer
      designs, which will be found in your Butterick Quarterly. Every transfer
      pattern gives illustrated directions for making stitches suitable for that
      design.</p>

  <p> Feather-stitching, when fine and exquisite, is one of the very nicest decorative
        stitches for small children's garments and fine lingerie. It is often
    used in rows between tiny hand run tucks on baby dresses and coats. One also
        sees it used in small circles and scrolls on fine underwear or on a baby's
  cap.</p>
  <p> To keep your line of feather-stitching delicate and even, run a line
          of colored basting to mark the center line for the sewing. To make
    a single feather-stitch
        start with a knot; bring the thread up from the wrong side and hold the
          sewing thread down over the line with the left thumb. Take a short
    slanting stitch
        a little to the left of this line pointing the needle toward the right.
          Draw the needle out while the thread is still held down by the left
    thumb. To
        prepare for the next stitch hold down the thread on the center line and
          take a stitch of equal length on right side of line; draw the needle
    out.</p>
  <p> For double feather-stitching take two slanting stitches close together
          on the left of the center line and take two similar stitches on the
    right of
          the line. Triple feather-stitching has three small slant-stitches.
    The beauty of this stitch depends upon its delicacy and evenness. Marks on
          the illustration
      indicate position and direction for the stitches.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><a name="right" id="right"></a>Smocking is always fashion-right.</h3>
  <p> Smocking is very decorative. It consists of tightly drawn-up gathers held
        together by evenly spaced embroidery stitches usually of a color contrasting
        with the garment. It is much used for children's garments of the better
        kind both here and abroad. You will find it on tiny dresses, infants'
    coats, little boys' suits and on the so-called peasant dress worn by juniors.
        The materials best adapted to smocking are fine batiste, nainsook, lawn,
        handkerchief linen, cotton crepe and cotton voile. Some of the heavier
        materials may also be smocked, such as chambray, cotton broadcloth, fine
        wool serge and crepe de chine. You should always have Butterick transfer
        patterns to guide you. They not only give the design of the smocking
    and
        amount to be gathered-up but also instructions for working the embroidery
        stitches over the plaits. Transfers recommended for various patterns
    have all been carefully tested.</p>
<h3><a name="gather" id="gather"></a>It matters how you gather.</h3>
  <p> Both gathering and shirring may be done by hand or by machine. Your machine
        attachment direction book will tell you how to do it on your machine.
Be sure to consult it frequently.</p>
  <p> When gathering by hand make a row of small running stitches just outside
        the seam allowance line. Stitches and spaces may be the same length or
          the spaces may be twice the length of the stitches if the stitch is
    small. Use
        a knot and start on the wrong side of the garment. Slip the gathering
    stitch along on your needle as you work and do not take the needle out of
    the
material until you finish a row. This keeps your gathering straight.    </p>
  <p class="clear"><a href="paris-illus/p-128.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',528,627);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-128-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 128" width="140" height="152" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>If you use only a single row of gathers to hold in the fullness you should
    place the gathers parallel or &quot;stroke&quot; them before sewing the gathered
    portion into a seam. To do this remove the needle from the end of the thread,
    draw up the gathers tightly and fasten them, winding the end of the gathering
    thread in the form of a figure eight over a vertical pin placed in the material
    at the end of the gathering line.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><a name="stroking" id="stroking"></a>&quot;Stroking&quot; makes gathers even.</h3>
  <p> <a href="paris-illus/p-129.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',519,813);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-129-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 129" width="140" height="139" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>Now, grasp the work firmly between the thumb and fingers of the left hand
        with the thumb below the gathering thread. Press each little gather against
        the thumb with the side of the needle, drawing the needle along the gather
        above and below the gathering thread. Do not use the point of the needle
        for this since you may scratch and weaken the material. Place each gather
        in this way so that the work falls in straight, flat folds. This operation
        takes a little more time but the enhanced appearance of your gathers
    makes it worth while. (Ill. 129.)</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><a name="related" id="related"></a>Double gathering and shirring are related.</h3>
  <p> <a href="paris-illus/p-130.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',428,669);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-130-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 130" width="140" height="120" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>When we use two rows of gathering in dressmaking, and we often do, gathers
      will hang straight and we do not need to stroke them. Where a full skirt
      is joined to a band or a sleeve is joined to a straight cuff, two rows
      will keep the gathers in their proper place and make the seam very flat.
      The second row of gathers is made in a parallel line, 1/4&quot; below the
      first row. Shirring is made of a number of parallel rows of gathers. To
      be attractive, it must be evenly spaced, not too far apart (1/4&quot; is
      ample), and the rows must be absolutely parallel. Mark shirring lines by
      basting thread while the material is still flat. These basting lines are
      later to be removed. Shirring is decorative and is considered a trimming.
      (Ill. 130.)</p>

  <p> Gauging or French gathers are used when a large quantity of fabric must
    be drawn up tightly to fit a small space. Like shirting, this is a very decorative
addition to your frock. (Ill. 131.)</p>
  <p> Make your stitches long on the right side and short on the wrong side of
    the material. Make each row of gathers with the spaces and the stitches exactly
    under each other. The rows may be 3/8&quot; apart. The gathering threads
are then all drawn up tightly and evenly and fastened at the ends, securely.</p>

        at the same time. Roll the edge of the ruffle and overhand quite closely
        as far as it is rolled taking care to take the stitch below the roll
    but not through it. Draw up the ruffle as you go along to the desired fullness.
        (Illustration 132.) To gauge the fullness exactly, divide the ruffle
    in
        quarters and mark the points with colored thread. Make corresponding
    marks on the edge to which the ruffle is to be attached. Test the length
    of your
        ruffle occasionally as you draw it up. To attach this whipped and gathered
        ruffle to the garment, roll the edge of the garment and overhand the
    ruffle to it, taking a stitch in each whipped stitch of the ruffle.</p>
  <h3><a name="machineshir" id="machineshir"></a>Machine shirring.</h3>
  <p> Where you have dozens of rows of shirring to make, do it on the sewing
    machine using the gathering attachment. You will need to baste the first
    line for
        the stitching but subsequent lines can be spaced by the use of the gauge
        on your machine.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><a href="paris-illus/p-133.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',650,280);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-133-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 133" width="140" height="251" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a><a name="more" id="more"></a>More machine shirring.</h3>
  <p> Still another very easy and satisfactory way of shirring on the machine
    is to make parallel rows of machine stitching the correct distance apart
    but
        stitch with rather a loose upper tension and a medium length stitch.
    Now pin the center of the stitched piece of material to the table or any
    flat
        surface. Hold all the under threads of the stitched lines together with
        one hand. With the other hand push the material gently up toward the
    center to form the shirrings. (Illustration 133.)</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a name="fur" id="fur"></a>Fur collars and cuffs in the professional manner.</h3>
  <p> The Deltor will tell you how to make and attach fur collars and cuffs in
        the best manner. There are times, however, when you will need to mend
    fur garments or recut a collar or band of fur to change its shape or to remove
worn parts. The following suggestions will help you.</p>
  <p> Furs should always be cut with a sharp knife from the wrong side of the
skin so as not to cut the hair.</p>
  <p> Joinings should be made so that all the hair runs the same way. Cow
licks on our fur collars are no more desirable than boyish bobs.</p>
  <p> Fur seams should be sewed with a strong cotton thread. No. 30 is
about right with an ordinary needle.        </p>
  <p class="clear"><a href="paris-illus/p-134.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',168,160);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-134-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 134" width="140" height="148" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>Lay fur pieces edge to edge with the fur side down and overhand the edges
    together. Try not to catch in the hair as you sew. The hair can be pushed
    through to the right side as you sew and after the seam is made the fur can
    be brushed gently to make the hair lie smooth and conceal any sign of the
    seam. (Ill. 134.)</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a name="dampen" id="dampen"></a>Dampen the seam and stretch the fur.</h3>
  <p> There will now be a ridge-like seam on the wrong side. This seam must be
        made to lie flat so dampen the skin around the seam and stretch the fur
        collar flat on a board, fastening it down with thumb tacks. The fur must
        remain on the board until it is thoroughly dry but must not be put near
        the heat to hasten the drying too much. The drying takes twenty-four
  hours.</p>
  <p> If the fur is long haired the skin side must be tacked against the board.
        Short haired furs like beaver a and seal can be tacked with the fur side
    down.</p>
  <h3><a name="smoothfur" id="smoothfur"></a>Smooth finishes for fur edges.</h3>
  <p> The edges of fur must be &quot;taped&quot; or finished on the wrong side
    with braid or seam binding the color of the fur. The edge of the seam binding
    or twill-cotton tape is overhanded to the edge of the fur collar or band.
    Turn the tape over the edge of the fur toward the inside of the collar and
    catch-stitch the tape flat to the pelt. (Illustration 134.) Attach collar
    by slip-stitching through this tape.</p>
  <p> Some old furs or furs that have been poorly dyed have very tender pelts.
      The taping serves as a splendid reinforcement.</p>
  <p> In dyed or in white furs, if the hair is long enough to cover the edges,
        omit the taping. Sew the edge of the pelt to the garment with a hemming
        stitch.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><a href="paris-illus/p-135.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',634,725);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-135-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 135" width="140" height="170" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a><a name="ostrich" id="ostrich"></a>Ostrich feathers for your negligee.</h3>
  <p> Feather trimming is delicate stuff and should be very daintily handled.
    Mark the line on the garment with basting where the banding is to be attached.
        There may be a cord at the top. Rip it off. Arrange the upper edge of
    the
        trimming along the thread line and overhand it to position using thread
        the same color as your trimming.</p>

        flat. Stitch trimming to the edge of garment by machine using the cording
    presser foot, stitching close to the cord, or sew by hand.</p>

  <p> Quilling or closely folded narrow side plaitings may be made straight or

    seam allowance of garment, basting and stitching to quilling close to the
    folded
        edge of your garment. (Illustration 137.)</p>
<h3><a name="tailored" id="tailored"></a>You, too, can make tailored garments.</h3>
  <p> We often hear women say &quot;I like to make dresses and underwear but I'm
    afraid to tackle a tailored coat.&quot; This is a totally unfounded fear,
    for if you use a Butterick pattern and follow exactly the directions given
    by the Deltor for cutting, fitting, making interlinings, pockets and other
tailored details, you will get absolutely satisfactory results.</p>
  <p> As a matter of fact, tailored garments for women are much simpler than
    they used to be. Tailored effects at present in fashion are less stiff and
    boxy.
      The softer tailored effects are better style. Consequently there is less
      need for stiff interlinings, canvas reinforcements, velvet collars and
    notched lapels. Even these things, when in fashion, need not be difficult
    to make
      if you will just be careful to follow the directions that expert tailors
  have prepared.</p>
  <h3><a name="shears" id="shears"></a>A lot depends on your shears.</h3>
  <p> First of all, cut your woolens very carefully. This is always important
    but in nothing is it more important than in working with heavy woolen coatings.
        Use good, sharp shears of suitable length, follow the edge line of the
        pattern exactly and keep your Deltor near.</p>
  <h3><a name="shrinkage" id="shrinkage"></a>Consider the shrinkage on rainy days.</h3>
  <p> Presumably your coat or tailored garment is going to be exposed to damp
    or rainy weather. Your material therefore must be sponged and shrunk before
        you cut into it. This must be done to everything you use for the coat,
        the interlining, the facings, etc. This does not apply to fur or to silk
        coat linings. Silk linings are always put into a coat loosely so that
    they
        seldom draw even if wet.</p>
  <h3><a name="test" id="test"></a>Test your pattern as for a frock.</h3>
  <p> Before cutting you should pin your pattern together and test for length,
        size and position of armhole, and the fit of the neckline across the
    back. This has been described and suggested before, but we want to impress
    upon
        you again how essential it is to test your pattern. Be sure, also, to
    mark with tailor's tacks all notches and perforations on every piece of your
        tailored garment. On dark material you can sometimes use French chalk
    but
        tailor's tacks are safer.</p>
  <h3><a name="grain" id="grain"></a>Good tailors pay attention to grain.</h3>
  <p> Watch carefully for grain of material as you work. Most woolens have napped
      surfaces and the grain may not show up easily but let us remind you that
      even though the grain may not show at first glance the hang of the garment
      will be thrown completely out if any piece is cut &quot;off grain.&quot; Review
      our chapter on grain of material to refresh yourself on how to measure
      and fold to find the straight grain.</p>
  <h3><a name="everything" id="everything"></a>Just baste everything.</h3>
  <p> Now, a word about your basting. It's something like this; when in doubt,
        baste; baste in every possible place, and don't feel that by doing all
        this basting you are a rank amateur. You should see the condition of
    a partly made coat or suit in any good custom tailoring establishment. The
        pieces are lined and double lined with bastings, crossing and double
    crossing
        all over the garment. You see, basting is absolutely essential to hold
        parts against each other as you handle them. There must be no slipping
        or curling of edges during stitching or pressing. Your Deltor will faithfully
        tell you where bastings should be made.</p>
  <h3><a name="worry" id="worry"></a>Time and care now, saves care and worry later.</h3>
  <p> What of pinning in tailoring garments? Pin everything before you baste,
    putting pins in at right angles to seams and three or four inches apart.
    Hold seam
        edges toward you and pin from the bottom of a seam upward, holding your
        bias edges lightly. Pin and baste with the weight of your garment on
    a table.</p>
  <h3><a name="cautiously" id="cautiously"></a>Stitch cautiously.</h3>
  <p> Try out your machine stitch on a double piece of your coat material, and
        adjust the size of the stitch and the upper tension until you have the
        handsomest stitch possible. Use heavy sewing silk both on the bobbin
    and for the upper thread and a fairly coarse needle.</p>
  <h3><a name="often" id="often"></a>Press often.</h3>
  <p> Good tailors keep an iron and pressing board at their side constantly turning
        from the cutting table or the machine to press some tiny place only two
        or three inches long. This is the way to obtain the coveted tailored
    effect on seams and edges. The final pressing should never be the first.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a href="paris-illus/p-139.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',650,210);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-139-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 139" width="120" height="256" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a><a name="specialtailoring" id="specialtailoring"></a>Special tailoring for special places.</h3>
  <p> Directions for pressing various kinds of materials are given you in detail
      in Chapter XII. Read them before you make your tailored coat. In addition,
      you will need some special suggestions. For instance, if you are working
      with a stretchy material with a tendency to sag, the edges must be reinforced
      on the inside with a narrow linen tape, 3/8&quot; wide or with the selvedge
      of a lining material like unbleached muslin, which must be thoroughly shrunken
before you sew it to your coating.</p>
  <p> Many coat sleeves are finished without a cuff, particularly suit coat sleeves.
      Baste a bias strip of interlining to the bottom of the sleeve just above
      the turn of the hem. The cloth hem should then be turned over the reinforcement
      piece and catch-stitched to it. This sewing will, of course, be covered
    when the lining is put in.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><a href="paris-illus/p-138.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',631,548);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-138-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 138" width="140" height="193" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a><a name="shrinking" id="shrinking"></a>Shrinking coat sleeves to fit.</h3>
  <p> The thing to do with extra ease or fullness which is allowed at the top
    of a coat sleeve is to adjust the sleeve at the top to fit and then shrink
        out the extra fullness. To do this, slip the top of the sleeve over the
        small end of a tailor's cushion. In woolens lay a damp cloth over the
    gathers
        and press lightly, patting with iron. Use a dry cloth and a warm iron
    for silks.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><a name="lead" id="lead"></a>Lead weights are permissible.</h3>
  <p> Often flat lead weights are needed to make a garment hang down properly.
        Cover the weights with lining material before they are attached inside
        the hem of the coat so that they will not wear through.</p>
  <h3><a name="game" id="game"></a>A game for two.</h3>
  <p> Dressmaking is a real game&#8212;not a game of chance. There are rules as
    in any other game. The rules for making your coat are all in the Butterick
    Deltor. You can certainly follow simple Deltor directions and if you have
    a strong enough desire to own an individual well-made coat at an incredible
    saving of cash you can most certainly make it for yourself.</p>
  <h3><a name="pockets" id="pockets"></a>Pockets test a tailor.</h3>
  <p> Wherever the design of a Butterick pattern calls for a pocket, the Deltor
        tells you which kind to make and how. But we are going to let you in
    on some of the tailor's secrets we use in the Deltor.</p>
<h3><a name="laps" id="laps"></a>Little boys like in-and-out laps.</h3>
  <p> A manly looking tailored pocket for a boy's coat or a very tailored top
coat has an in-and-out lap.</p>
  <p> For making any kind of pocket, you must mark the pocket opening with
          a line of basting which shows plainly on both sides of the garment.
    Then stitch
        the lap to its lining with right sides together; turn lap right side
    out, baste around all its edges. Finished edges may be stitched or left soft
as you prefer.</p>
  <p> Leave edges raw along the top. Press the flap.</p>

  <p> Cut a facing two inches wide, long enough to extend one inch beyond each
    end of the basting line. Lay this facing on the right side of the garment
    with upper edge just touching the line. Baste and stitch 1/8&quot; below
  the edge. (Ill. 141.)</p>

  <p> Cut a slash between the stitchings being careful not to cut through the

Push the facing through the slash to the wrong
    side of the garment. Let facing form a binding 1/i4&quot; wide at the pocket
  opening on the right side. (Ill. 142.)</p>
  <p> Baste and stitch along the line where the binding joins the garment. Turn
    the lap down over the opening and baste close to the seam.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a name="four" id="four"></a>Step four: in-and-out lap pocket.</h3>
  <p> Now finish attaching the facing by turning to the wrong side of the garment.
        Turn in lower edge of facing and stitch it only to the attached pocket
        piece. Push the lap through the opening from the right side, keeping
  the raw edges upward and baste to the garment just below the pocket opening.</p>
  <p> Now prepare the inner pocket section by facing it with a piece of the
    garment material. Cut this facing about three inches wide.</p>
  <p> <a href="paris-illus/p-143.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',593,469);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-143-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 143" width="140" height="191" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>The inner pocket section
    is now placed over the outer section and they are basted together along the
    upper edges. Blind-stitch the top of
    the inner
          pocket section to the inside of the garment and stitch through all
    thicknesses above seam where lap joins garment. Turn the garment wrong side
    out and
          stitch the pocket sections together all the way around. Overcast the
            raw edges of
          the pocket sections. All these processes may be observed in illustration
      143.</p>
  <p class="clear"> <a href="paris-illus/p-144.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',331,518);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-144-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 144" width="140" height="118" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>Finish the ends of the pocket with worked bars on the right side. Pull
            out basting holding the pocket lap and pull the lap through the opening
            to the
        right side of the garment. The pocket is done. (Ill. 144.)</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><a name="welt" id="welt"></a>Welt pockets made the easy way.</h3>
  <p> A welt pocket looks well in medium weight
    material. You should have enough material to make both pieces of the pocket
    and the
    welt of the garment
        fabric.</p>
<h3><a name="first" id="first"></a>The first step is the same.</h3>
  <p> <a href="paris-illus/p-145.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',347,417);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-145-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 145" width="140" height="245" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>Mark the pocket opening for a welt pocket just as you do for a lap pocket.</p>
  <p>Lay both pocket
    sections face down on the
    right
    side of the garment. The raw edges should exactly touch the basting line
    which marks the pocket opening.
    Now, machine stitch each piece 3/8&quot; from the edge. This will leave 3/4&quot; between
    the two rows of stitching. Tie the ends of the stitching threads carefully
    to prevent your mistaking them for bastings later on and pulling them out.
    Examine illustration 145, which shows the pocket pieces being applied.</p>
  <p class="clear"> Cut the pocket slash along the marking
    line to within 3/16&quot; from each
    end. Now cut diagonally into the four corners almost to the stitching line,
    forming a&#8212;&lt; at each end. Turn this little triangle into the pocket opening,
    tacking it in place.</p>
  <p> The lower pocket section should be marked with a line of tailor's tacks
    to indicate the top edge of the welt.</p>
  <p> <a href="paris-illus/p-146.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',464,480);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-146-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 146" width="140" height="163" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>Now draw two pocket sections through to wrong side creasing lower section
        on line of tailor's tacks.</p>
  <h3><a name="over" id="over"></a>It's all over but the pressing.</h3>
  <p> The seam at the lower edge of the opening should be carefully pressed down
        against the garment and the seam at the upper edge of the opening pressed
  up against the garment, on the inside, of course.</p>
  <p> Now, blind-stitch the lower pocket piece against the seam to form the
          welt. Turn in the ends of the welt evenly and blind-stitch to position
          on the outside
        of the garment.</p>
  <p> Next<a href="paris-illus/p-147.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',540,499);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-147-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 147" width="140" height="211" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a> turn to<a href="paris-illus/p-148.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',255,463);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-148-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 148" width="140" height="108" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a> the inside of your garment and stitch the pocket sections
          together, overcasting all edges. Press the whole pocket thoroughly,
    giving special
          attention to the welt. It is this final pressing that makes or breaks
          your pocket.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><a name="trim" id="trim"></a>A trim tailored pocket from one piece of cloth.</h3>
  <p> The one piece pocket is really just a large bound buttonhole with the pocket
        pieces just an extension of the binding. The bound pocket looks very
    well in light weight silk or woolen material and in firm but medium weight
    cottons,
        such as Indian Head or linens. Before you set your heart on bound pockets,
        take stock of your remnants. You must have enough of the dress material
        to make the entire pocket.</p>
  <h3 class="clear">  Mark pocket opening as usual with a line of basting.</h3>
  <p> Find the center, end to end, of your big pocket piece. Lay this center
    line over the basted marking line in your garment with the right <a href="paris-illus/p-150.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',545,480);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-150-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 150" width="140" height="185" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>sides <a href="paris-illus/p-149.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',631,441);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-149-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 149" width="140" height="228" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>together.
  Baste to position along the center line. Stitch 1/8&quot; from each side of
  the basting line and straight across the two ends. (Ill. 149.)</p>
  <p>Slash along the basting line as you did for the welt pocket, cutting diagonally
    into the corners almost to the stitching, and forming a&#8212;&lt; at each end.
    Press the seams open. Draw the pocket piece through the slash to the wrong
    side, forming a 1/8&quot; binding on the right side. Examine illustration
  150.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><a name="rightside" id="rightside"></a>Finish on the right side with machine stitching.</h3>
  <p> <a href="paris-illus/p-151.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',284,477);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-151-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 151" width="140" height="107" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>The pocket binding forms a tiny inverted box plait at each end of the pocket
        on the wrong side. Hold in place with a few stitches and catch the two
        bound edges of the pocket opening with crosswise stitches to keep pocket
        in shape. Make a row of machine stitching on the right side in the seam
    line where binding is sewed to the pocket opening. (Ill. 151.)</p>
  <p class="clear"> Now<a href="paris-illus/p-152.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',532,466);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="paris-illus/p-152-t.jpg" alt="Illustration 152" width="140" height="188" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a> turn to the inside of the garment and fold the upper pocket section
          down against the lower pocket section. Baste and stitch the two sections
          together.
        Trim off any unevenness at the bottom of the pocket and overcast the
    raw edges. Press the pocket on both sides of the garment. If possible, steam
      before removing cross stitching on the right side.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a name="suit" id="suit"></a>Suit your pocket to your fabric.</h3>
  <p> Bound pockets are particularly suited to fine materials without surface
    nap. Welt pockets are suited to both smooth finish materials and those with
        some nap. They have a less formal and precise look than bound pockets,
        consequently we often see them used in small boys' jackets, women's sport
        clothes and in dresses made of light weight tweed and covert cloth. If
        you use a welt pocket, you must be sure that the material used for the
        welt matches the material of the garment against which it rests, both
    as
to grain and woven or printed design.</p>

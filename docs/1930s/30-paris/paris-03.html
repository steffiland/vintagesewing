  <h2> Lesson III&#8212;Let Fabrics Work Their Magic </h2>

  </p>
<h3><a name="fabrics" id="fabrics"></a>Fabrics can make you or break you.</h3>
  <p> Selection of the material for your own particular costume requires much
    more finesse than you may have realized. Knowing what you like or what is
    in
      fashion is not a complete guide. Does the fabric like you as well? Does
it &quot;look like you&quot;&#8212;that is, like your personality?</p>
  <p> Give yourself and the pattern you have selected the best possible break.
      Do not buy anything but a good quality of material. Bargains in silks and
      woolens are seldom real bargains except under very unusual market conditions.
      The tired looking dress makes one feel weary. It is no wonder some dresses
      get looking tired so soon when one considers how little real strength the
      material had when it was born. A trip to the cleaner's usually saps whatever
      deceptive vitality the fabric had when you saw it on the counter. No, do
  not economize that way.</p>
<h3><b><i><a name="dont" id="dont"></a></i></b>Don't skimp on quantity.</h3>
  <p> And another timely warning, do not buy too little material. The remnant
    counter may help you out occasionally but usually it raises false hopes.
    The pattern
        envelope tells you exactly the amount of material to buy for average
    heights. If you happen to be six feet, two inches, then you had better buy
    additional
  quantity to cover your length.</p>
  <p> Materials can't be skimped or stretched to reach. Sleeves have been known
        to slip right out at the shoulder blade where seams were cut too narrow
          and backs were skimped to accommodate the limitations of too little
    fabric to
    really cut the dress.</p>
<h3><b><i><a name="envelope" id="envelope"></a></i></b>The pattern envelope is a shopping guide.</h3>
  <p> Many of us buy our pattern before we buy the fabric. In general that is
    a very good habit. For, voila, not only does the pattern envelope tell us
        how much fabric to buy, but what fabrics are especially good for each
  design.</p>
  <p> Tailored effects seldom look well in chiffons. By the same token, woolens,
        even the medium weight ones, should not be used for billowy fluttery
    designs. Stiff taffetas that gather delightfully into puffs just cannot be
    draped.
        Take the advice of your pattern envelope with respect to matters of this
    sort.</p>
  <p> Luxurious, decorative materials like velvets and metals are themselves
          sufficiently interesting to be made up in the simplest fashion. Whatever
          happens, don't
      look dressed up in your grandest clothes.</p>
<h3><b><i><a name="breaking" id="breaking"></a></i></b>Breaking into print.</h3>
  <p> Prints should be made from a pattern of few pieces and simple cut, Avoid
      the bother of matching leaves and stems by choosing a design with few pieces
      to put together. If you feel a little amateurish at first with your dressmaking,
      use some jolly little all-over print fabric. Any slight mistakes will be
      completely hidden from the most critical eye. Plain fabrics are not so
kind to the new but enthusiastic dressmaker.</p>
  <p> The present fashion indicates some intricacy of seaming for the plain flat
    crepe, canton or crepe roma dress. Satins require some delicacy of touch.
    If you have a sure touch and like to take pains, by all means make yourself
    some stunning clothes in these fabrics. There is an elegance emanating from
    the folds and gleaming surfaces of the satin gown which we all want to radiate,
    that is, provided we are not endowed with too many curves. The heavy set
woman wears her satins dull if she wears them at all.</p>
  <p> Who has not been puzzled when buying prints? It's a desperate feeling to
    see counters filled with bolt after bolt of prints&#8212;and they all look
    so alluring. Remember the material will fall in folds in your dress, its
    flatness will disappear&#8212;and it is the effect of the fabric held against
    you which matters rather than the delightful little lines in the detail of
    the design. Don't think for a minute that the print draped over the burly
    shoulder of the super-salesman will look the same draped over your own ladylike
    proportions. So carry your prospective purchase to a mirror and really see
    effects against yourself, and in relation to your own coloring and even your
    facial expression. The large colorful print may be for you but consider it
    carefully. It is more important to you that your personality subtly expresses
    itself, than that the world should know you are wearing a new print gown.
    Small jewel-like prints have a tendency to make the body recede from the
dress in flattering fashion.</p>
  <p> Transparent, fluffy dresses made over well fitted slips give a sensation
      of three dimensions which helps create this illusion. And by the way, a
    built-up line at the top of such a slip is much more flattering to a person
    with heavy
  shoulders and bust than the straight across variety.</p>
<h3><b><i><a name="ensemble" id="ensemble"></a></i></b>What of this newly discovered ensemble?</h3>
  <p> As a matter of fact we have always dressed in ensembles if we were well
    dressed people, but we didn't have a name for it. We used to call it &quot;good
      taste in dress.&quot; Our stores gave us little help in assembling our
      effects. We had to make our own discoveries in chic. Now they are merchandised
      with the express purpose of coordinating everything we wear so that we
      may present a harmonious whole as we step out. We may now really indulge
      our fancy for combining fabrics and colors, for the stores have the merchandise
    if we will but use care and discrimination in our selections.</p>
  <p> In general, bright startling colors may rob us of our own color and extinguish
    us. So if you have a special hankering for a Chinese red dress, just control
    yourself on the hat and be satisfied with a dark or light hat with some small
    touch of your favorite red deftly introduced as a harmonious note. Save the
    red beads for something else and wear a string of pearls or omit decorations
    altogether.</p>
  <p> Gloves and stockings, shoes and bags&#8212;shall they match each other,
    the dress, the coat, or what? Whatever we say on that point may have to be
    unsaid
    six weeks from now. In general, some subtle relationship should exist between
    hose and gloves. Shoes and bags, for the present at least, should bear a
    color relationship if not always a texture relationship.</p>
  <p> To restate our original thesis, an ensemble is a complete costume in good
      taste, with that suavely casual appearance that is the result of careful
    weighing of effects.</p>
  <p> Let us not look too precisely dressed.</p>

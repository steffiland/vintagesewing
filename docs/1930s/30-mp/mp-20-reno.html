  <h2> RENOVATION AND CARE OF HATS AND HAT MATERIALS</h2>
    <h4> <strong>RENOVATING HATS</strong></h4>
    <p> The &quot;left-over&quot; hat is one of the problems to which every woman
      should give careful consideration, if for no other reason than the conservation
      of the materials. It is a very unusual hat indeed that requires no changes
      whatever if it is to be utilized a second year. In spite of our ever-changing
      styles there is usually some way of making an old hat more up-to-date in
      appearance. Generally the first step in any renovation process is the cleansing
    of the hat and its trimmings.</p>
    <h3> <a name="clean" id="clean"></a>Cleaning and Bleaching Straw and Braid Hats</h3>
    <p><strong> White and light-colored hats. </strong>All straw and braid hats should be cleaned
          frequently to keep them in good condition. One very simple process
      for removing dust and dirt from all light-colored hats is to rub them thoroughly
          with
          fresh rye bread. An end cut from the loaf makes a convenient piece
      to
            handle. This method of cleaning takes only a few moments and may
      be used without
          removing the trimmings from the hat.</p>
    <p> Leghorns, milans, panamas, and chips and all fiber braids may be cleaned
            effectively with corn meal and any noninflammable cleaning fluid.
      The corn meal (&frac34; of a cup or more, according to the amount of cleaning
            to be done)
            should be placed in a small vessel and dampened with the cleaner.
      The
            moist corn meal is thrown over the surface of the hat and rubbed
      in briskly with
            a brush or a light cloth. Care must be taken to go over every portion
            of the hat, for this insures even 
      cleaning. After the liquid cleaner has evaporated, brush the corn
            meal from the braid thoroughly. The odor is dissipated more quickly
            by heat
            than by
            cold; so if the hat is put in a warm place the odor will soon disappear.</p>
    <p> Leghorn and panama hats may also be washed with tepid soapsuds made
              from a good white soap or soap flakes. Before washing, the hat
      crown should
              be stuffed tightly with white tissue paper; it is also a wise precaution
              to
              run a wire around the head size to keep it from shrinking. Or the
              crown may be slipped over an old fabric crown or a block, which
      will help
              to keep it
              in place. In order to hold the brim in place during the washing,
              it may be pinned to a soft-wood board or ironing board, using common
              steel
              pins
              or
              thumb tacks. After washing, the hat surface should be well rinsed
              to remove all the soap. This is done by wetting a cloth in clear
              water
              and wiping
              the braid carefully several times. Then, with a dry cloth, wipe
      as much of the
              moisture from the straw as possible.</p>
    <p> All straw braids may be pressed, and a hat that has been washed
                will need pressing. However, if the hat is to be bleached also,
                the pressing
                should
                not be done until after the bleaching.</p>
    <p> If, after careful cleaning, sunburned spots are found, the hat
                  may be <em>bleached</em>. Many commercial bleaching powders and crystals
                  are on
                  the market.
                  Care
                  should be taken, however, not to use a bleach that is too strong
                  or the acid may
                  injure the straw. After applying the bleaching liquid, rinse
                  thoroughly as described for cleaning.</p>
    <p> A homemade bleach may be made from lemon juice and sulphur,
                    using the juice of 2 lemons and 2 tablespoonfuls of sulphur.
      Dampen the sulphur with the lemon juice and rub into the hat. Or dip a
      cut lemon into the sulphur
                    and rub over
                    the
                    hat surface,
                    redipping the lemon as the sulphur becomes absorbed.</p>
    <p> <a name="press" id="press"></a>Pressing is done by fitting the crown over a crown block,
                      a small bowl or stewpan, a hard pad of cloth, or anything
                      which
                      will
                      fill the crown
                      and give
                      a firm surface. Always place a dry cloth between the hat
                      surface and the iron to insure against browning or scorching
                      the braid.
                      A <em>flat
                      brim</em> may
                      be pressed on a flat surface, but a <em>curved or rolled
                      brim</em>      must be pressed over
                      a hard cloth pad made to fit the curve. The iron must be
                      kept in constant motion during the pressing, for if it
      is permitted
                      to
                      rest on any one
                      spot, its impression will be left.</p>
    <p><strong> Black and dark-colored hats. </strong>There are many methods
      for cleaning black straw hats. The simplest of these is to
                        rub the hat
                        very briskly with
                        a piece of
                        black or dark velvet. Another simple but remarkably good
                        method is to rub the hat with a dark cloth dampened in
                        a solution
                        of &frac34; pure
                        alcohol
                        and
                        &frac14; water. This brings to the straw a revived newness
      and brightness. Vaseline, glycerin, or olive oil on a flannel
                        cloth may be
                        rubbed lightly over the
                        hat, and followed by a coat of clear shellac to give
      stiffness and luster. This shellac comes already mixed and is easily
                        applied with
                        a paintbrush.
                        Instead of shellac, <a name="gum" id="gum"></a>gum arabic may be used when the hat
                        is in need of but slight stiffening. Dissolve 2 tablespoonfuls
                        of
                        gum arabic
                        in a
                        cup of
                        boiling water, cool, and apply to the hat with a soft
      cloth or brush. This gives
                        a natural stiffness not only to straws and other braids
                        but
                        also to laces and wash fabrics that have lost their crispness.</p>
    <p> After the bleaching or cleaning process, some braids
                          seem to have lost their original luster. This may be
                          brought
                          back by
                          rubbing
                          them well
                          with a piece
                          of cloth or velvet. Proceed as in polishing any other
                          household article. This method is most effective on
      braids of extremely
                          smooth surface,
                          such as bangkoks, bali-buntal, peanit braids, and the
                          like.</p>
    <h3> <a name="felt" id="felt"></a>Felt Hats</h3>
    <p> Felts need cleaning more often than straws, for they
                              are of different texture; coming in contact, as
      they do, with
                              the
                              fur collars
                              of coats and the oil
                              from the hair, they need almost constant attention.
                              It is best not to let them become too soiled before
                              cleaning.                              </p>
    <p>When
                                they
                                are only
                                slightly soiled,
                                it is sometimes sufficient to sponge them with
        a weak solution of ammonia water. For smooth-napped felts
                                the use of an
                                ordinary ten-cent
                                rubber
                                sponge is effective. It acts as an eraser, does
        not harm the felt, and
                                amply repays
                                the slight effort involved.</p>
    <p> If the entire hat is too badly soiled to be cleaned
                                by these simple solutions, much the safest way
                                is to send
                                it, trimmings
                                and all,
                                to some cleansing
                                establishment, where it will be thoroughly cleansed
                                for a small cost.</p>
    <p> There are many noninflammable commercial cleaners,
                                  both liquid and paste, which may be safely
      used to clean both
                                  the hat
                                  and its trimmings.
                                  If
                                  the hat needs pressing after it is cleaned,
      use the method described for <a href="#press">pressing
                                  straw braids</a>. If the nap of the felt
                                  is flattened by the pressing, rub it with a
      piece of fine sandpaper
                                  or a very
                                  stiff
                                  brush until the
                                  original condition is restored. </p>
    <h3><a name="dye" id="dye"></a>Dyeing Hats</h3>
    <p> There are two processes for dyeing hats: they may be immersed in a dye
      bath or they may be painted with a commercial dye.</p>
    <p> Hats of soft, pliable straw braid, and all artificial silk, or hemp braid,
        may be placed in a warm dye bath, using cotton dye. Dissolve the dye
      and bring it to the boiling point; remove it from the stove, and immerse
      the
        hat. Let it stand in the dye until it is thoroughly soaked; then let
      it dry over a commercial or homemade crown block. If a slight stiffness
          is needed,
        the <a href="#gum">gum-arabic solution</a>  recommended for straw hats
        may be used. When dry, press as was done after cleaning. All strip braids,
        including
          horsehair, may be put in a dye bath; felts also may be dyed in this
      way
          if care is taken
        to dry them on blocks. Strip braids should be laid on a rough surface;
        and pressed on the wrong side.</p>
    <p> It is unwise to attempt to dye a hat its original color, for it is
            very difficult to match the color exactly. Choose instead a slightly
            deeper
          tone which will
          cover any spots or faded places. All commercial dyes are concentrated
            and must be diluted to get the tint or shade desired. For <em>tints</em> use
            only a
          small quantity of dye. For <em>deeper tones</em> use more dye, but add only
      a small quantity
          at a time until the shade is right. Keep in mind that the color always
          will be slightly lighter when dry.</p>
    <p> Ready-to-use commercial dyes that are painted on the hat with a brush
            may be used for straw hats instead of the dye bath. These must be
      handled carefully
            if the hat is not to be made stiffer than is attractive. To go over
            the hat many times with a small quantity of dye 
      is much better than to use more dye and cover the hat but once. If
            the brush is too heavily loaded with dye, it will leave spots. These
            dyes
            usually come
            in both luster and dull finish.</p>
    <p> Common tube oil paints may be used most successfully for dyeing straw
              braids. By mixing carefully, any costume may be matched. The paint
              is thinned to
              the consistency that will enable it to be spread smoothly over
      the braid surface. If one of the noninflammable liquid cleaners is used
              for thinning,
              very little of the disagreeable odor will be left on the finished
              product.</p>
    <h3> <a name="ren" id="ren"></a>RENOVATING HAT MATERIALS</h3>
    <h4> <strong>Flowers</strong></h4>
    <p> Before a worn or faded flower is thrown away, it is always best
                    to go over it carefully to see if at least a part of it may
            not be used
                    again.
                    Sometimes
                    a lovely bit of color is found in the center, which may be
            combined attractively with a fresher flower. Many methods are used
            in
              the renovation of flowers.
                    Water colors, batik dye, cold-water dyes of all kinds, oil
            paints, crayons, and rouge may all be used.</p>
    <p> When oil paint is used, it should be mixed with some noninflammable
                      liquid cleaner. The whole flower may be dipped into this,
              or the mixture may
                      be applied with a brush. Lovely tints or combinations are
              obtained in this
                      way. All frayed edges should be trimmed carefully and the
              petals pressed with
                      a medium-hot iron. To add crispness the back of the petal
              may be brushed lightly with a solution of gum arabic or of sugar
                      and water,
                      or with
                      the nonstaining millinery glue.</p>
    <p> Crayons and rouge should be rubbed over the flower
      surface until the desired shade is obtained. The oil crayons
                        may be made fast color by pressing with a hot iron. When
                        flower crowns
                        are
                        in vogue,
                        they always give opportunity for using renovated flowers.
                        The color of these flowers may be restored by dipping
          or painting,
                        and they
                        may then
                        be mixed
                        successfully with fresh flowers. This lessens the expense
                        of the hat. Renovated flowers are improved by a thin
          covering of malines
                        or tulle.</p>
    <h4> <strong>Foliage</strong></h4>
    <p> Foliage may be renovated by painting each leaf with
                            melted paraffin and pressing with a warm iron. The
            heat spreads
                            the paraffin, and
                            only a slight
                            coating remains to give freshness. Trim the edges
      of the leaf; if the little wires at the back are loose,
                            paste
                            them back
                            into place
                            with
                            glue. If the
                            foliage is made of velvet instead of cambric, it
      may be steamed and cleaned, or, if necessary, it may be
            given a dye bath
                            and then steamed.
                            It is
                            always best to clean flowers and foliage before putting
                            them in the dye bath.
                            Velvet leaves may be stiffened by painting the back
            with millinery glue or a gum-arabic
                            solution. Leaves made of cambric may be made extra
            shiny by a coating of shellac.</p>
    <h4> <strong>Laces</strong></h4>
    <p> Gold and silver lace may be brightened by cleaning
                                in alcohol.</p>
    <p> White silk lace may be soaked in a solution of
                                  borax and water, one tablespoon of borax to
      one quart of
                                  warm water.
                                  Let it
                                  stand about
                                  twenty-four hours.
                                  Then, if the lace is wide, pin it on an ironing
                                  board, so
      that the design will not be lost. When almost
                                  dry remove the pins and press lightly on the
                                  wrong
                                  side over a
                                  <em>rough</em> cloth.
                                  If the
                                  lace is
                                  narrow, wind
                                  it around a bottle or fruit jar; let it dry,
                                  and press in the same way. Or lace may be washed
                                  in
                                  tepid water
                                  in which
                                  soap
                                  or soap
                                  flakes have
                                  been
                                  dissolved. Baste it on a strip of muslin and
                                  wash by squeezing between the fingers. Do not
                                  rub. Rinse
                                  well,
                                  let dry partly,
                                  and press as
                                  before.</p>
    <p> Black lace may be cleaned and stiffened at
                                    the same time by dipping into a solution
      of &frac34; alcohol
                                    and
                                    &frac14; water.
                                    Stretch
                                    and pin
                                    on an ironing
                                    board. When dry, the lace will look bright
                                    and clean and its original stiffness will
      be restored.</p>
    <h4> <strong>Ribbons</strong></h4>
    <p> Ribbons are not easily cleaned at home unless
                                        they are of the satin or taffeta that
      is made for washing.
                                        It
                                        is much
                                        better
                                        to send
                                        them to the
                                        dry-cleaner's.
                                        For washable ribbons use suds made of
      white soap and tepid water. Then wind the ribbon
                                        around
                                        a bottle; when almost
                                        dry, remove
                                        from the bottle
                                        and press
                                        between cloth or paper. Ribbon may also
            be dried by
                                        placing it flat on a cloth and then rolling
                                        cloth and ribbon
                                        so that the
                                        cloth will
                                        absorb
                                        most
                                        of the moisture. When the ribbon is partly
                                        dry, press it as directed above.</p>

    <p> Velvets are too expensive to be tossed

                                            to renovation
                                            if a

                                            simple. Cut
                                            a strip of heavy
                                            tin 6 inches

                                            wide enough to admit an iron handle.
                                            An electric iron is to be preferred,
                                            since
                                            it does not require reheating and
                                            is more easily regulated, but the
                                            old-fashioned
                                            flatiron will
                                            serve the purpose

                                            the hot

                                            thicknesses of cotton cloth which
                                            has been
                                            dipped in water and well wrung out.
                                            Over the wet cloth put one thickness

                                            cloth. This serves to protect the

                                            doing so
                                            and being careful always to brush
                                            in the direction of the nap,
                                            never against it. Take great care
                                            in the first brushing not to press
                                            down
                                            so hard that
                                            the velvet is dampened by the cloth
                                            beneath. After skill is acquired
                                            the velvet may
                                            be
                                            drawn very
                                            quickly and
                                            easily over
                                            the surface.</p>
    <p> If a tin iron rest is not available,
                                              place two bricks or any other firm
                                              support about
                                              two inches
                                              apart;

                                              rest a heated
                                              iron,
                                              handle down;

                                              may be turned on its side and used

       of the strip and taking long
                                                light strokes. Be exceedingly
                                                careful
                                                never to allow
                                                the outer edge of the iron
                                                to touch the velvet,
                                                or streaking will result. After
                                                the iron has been sent across
                                                the full

                                                and go across again,
                                                always overlapping the first
                                                strip a trifle to avoid the same
                                                possibility of streaking.
                                                Next turn
                                                the velvet to the right and repeat
                                                the process. Unless the velvet
                                                has been abused

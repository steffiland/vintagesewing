  <h2> FLOWER AND FRUIT ORNAMENTS</h2>
    <p> The converting of small pieces of silk, velvet, crepe, georgette, organdie,
    and ribbon into flower or fruit ornaments is most fascinating and profitable.
    A knowledge of this work is of value not only in the workrooms of large shops
    but also in the class laboratory and the home. Between home-makers or members
    of a class small pieces of different materials may be exchanged and fashioned
    into decorations. This is a good way to cut the cost of hat trimmings.</p>
    <h3> <a name="flo" id="flo"></a>FLOWER ORNAMENTS</h3>
    <p> Flower ornaments are not only appropriate for hat trimmings, but many
      of them are equally lovely on other wearing apparel. The conventional designs,
    which are always the most desirable, are made from a variety of petal-shaped
    pieces. The placing of the petal and the type of petal used depend upon what
    is preferred in the finished flower. The types described in this section
    form an adequate foundation for all flower construction ; they are all practical
    and not fads of a season.</p>
    <h4> <strong><em><a href="illust/055.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,691);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/055-t.jpg" alt="Figure 55" width="150" height="130" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Rolled-petal Rose</strong></h4>
    <h6><strong>Figure 55. Rose made of rolled petals with square base. <em>A</em>, square
      from which petal is made; <em>B</em>, first stetp in rolling petal; <em>C</em>,
      completed petal, with base cut square; <em>D,</em> completed rose, built
      on crinoline foundation.</strong></h6>
    <p> The rolled petal is much in favor, for it is most simple in construction,
    has a graceful but firm edge, and may be made in large sizes without the
    appearance of bulk. Each petal of Fig. 55 is made from a 3-inch square of
    taffeta. Since the number of petals in different flowers vary so greatly,
    it is not always possible to tell how many petals will be needed for the
    completed flower. For convenience a goodly number should be made before 
    starting to build the flower. The steps in the construction of a petal are
    as follows:</p>
    <p> Cut a 3-inch square on the <em>straight</em> of the material. This is
      important if successful results are to be secured, 
    because the roll, which is made from the upper left-hand point toward the
    <em>center</em>, must be on a <em>perfect bias</em>. </p>
    <p>Place a heavy millinery needle or a fine
      steel knitting needle at the upper left-hand point of the square. Gently
      press the point of the fabric over the needle and roll the material firmly
      against the needle. The needle may be left in the roll until the opposite
      points which form the triangle are reached, or it may be removed after
      the first three or four turns of the roll have been made, in which case
      the
        material
      must be held firmly while the 
      roll is being completed.</p>
    <p> Form the petal by holding the rolled edge in the right hand, and with
      the left hand laying the base of the petal in small folds. When this is
      completed,
    secure the petal by wrapping with several windings of thread. Cut away the
    material which extends beyond the thread line, leaving just enough for a
    secure fastening. This makes the base of the petal very <em>compact</em> and
    <em>square</em>    (Fig. 55, <em>C</em>).</p>
    <p> <a name="cutcrin" id="cutcrin"></a>Cut a circle of crinoline for the foundation of the flower. The size
      of this circle varies according to the size of the rose desired. A circle
      two or
    three inches in diameter makes a rose of ordinary size. The circle may be
    cut as large as the diameter of the finished 
    flower, using the circumference of the circle as the guide line for the outer
    edge of the first layer of petals and then trimming the crinoline away near
    the first stitching after the flower is finished. Or the crinoline circle
    may be cut smaller, using the outer edge of the circle as the point at which
    the first row of petals is attached.</p>
    <p> Whatever the size of the crinoline base, in attaching the first row of
      petals be careful to place each petal on a <em>straight line</em> from the center
      of the
    circle to the circumference of the circle, thus insuring a perfect outer
    line. The second row is placed so that the petals are not in a straight line
    with the first row (that is, petal is not placed upon petal), but over the
    lower rolled edges of two petals, resembling greatly the succession of petals
    in a rose. Continue adding row after row until the center is reached. The
    center then may be finished by lapping two petals back upon themselves and
    fastening them, or by the use of any decoration, such as wooden beads, floss,
    chenille, or yarn.</p>
    <p class="clear"> Very <strong><em><a href="illust/057.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,688);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/057-t.jpg" alt="Figure 57" width="150" height="131" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em></strong>lovely<strong><em><a href="illust/056.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,265);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/056-t.jpg" alt="Figure 56" width="120" height="236" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em></strong> color combinations may be worked out by alternating colors
      in the rows of petals. Also an equal number of squares may be cut from
      two different
    colors, then each square cut into two triangles, and the two colors joined
    to re-form the square. When this square of combined colors is rolled, one
    color forms the roll and the other the background (Fig. 56).</p>
    <h6><strong><a name="fig56" id="fig56"></a>Figure 56. Combination petals. <em>A</em>, showing triangles of two different
      colors joined to form square; <em>B</em>, showing two petals, one with
      the light-colored edge roll with a dark background, the other with the
      colors reversed.</strong></h6>
    <p> Fig. 57 presents another problem in the rolled petal.</p>
    <h6><strong>Figure 57. Rose made of rolled petals with base spread apart. <em>A, </em>shaped
      piece from which petal is made; <em>B,</em> first stetp in rolling point
      towawrd center, with gathering thread in place; <em>C,</em> petal rolled
      with thread drawn up; <em>D,</em> completed flower.</strong></h6>
    <p class="clear"> Proceed with the cutting of the square as in Fig. 55. Trim one point
    of each square to form a curved base.</p>
    <p> Along this curved base place a line of running stitches, but do not pull
    the thread up and fasten until after the outer roll is turned.</p>
    <p> Roll the point toward the center (Fig. 57, <em>B</em>), holding the rolled edge
      securely between the finger and thumb of the left hand. Draw up the thread
      to about
    half the length of the curved base, and secure. The base will be much broader
    than in <em>C</em>, Fig. 55, forming an open, flatter petal.</p>
    <p> Cut a foundation circle of crinoline as described on <a href="#cutcrin">page
        71</a>. Place the
      first row of petals around the edge of the crinoline circle, keeping the
      base of
    each petal spread apart, each succeeding petal lapping the preceding petal
    one half its width. When this first row is 
    placed, start the second row by placing the edge of the petal slightly below
    but at the center of the base of the petal above. Continue filling in row
    after row until the center is reached. Finish the center with three small
    petals or some other decoration.</p>
    <p> Figs. 55 and 57 are cut from squares of the same size and have the same
      type of rolled edge, but the finish at 
    the bottom of the petal and the different placing of the petal make a very
    different type of flower when completed.</p>
    <h4> <strong>Rose formed of Soft, Upright Petals</strong></h4>
    <p class="clear"><strong><em><a href="illust/058.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,730);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/058-t.jpg" alt="Figure 58" width="160" height="132" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em></strong>Cut
      a strip of paper 5&frac14; inches long and 2&frac14; inches wide. Fold
      on the lengthwise line; fold again, bringing the 
  ends together. Start cutting at the lower right-hand cut edges, and slope
      gradually until the top of the upright fold is reached. Open, and place
  the paper pattern on the fabric, cutting as many exact duplicates as will be
      needed, with the length of the petal on the straight of the fabric (see
  Fig.
    58, <em>B</em>).</p>
    <h6><strong><a name="fig58" id="fig58"></a>Figure 58. Rose made of soft, upright petals. <em>A,</em> folded pattern
      of petal; <em>B,</em> unfolded petal; <em>C</em>, petal folded in half
      and base shirred; <em>D,</em> cimpleted rose.</strong></h6>
    <p> Fold the petal on the lengthwise thread of the material, bringing the
      curved sides (which are the raw edges) together. Attach these edges with
      a row
      of running stitches, pulling the stitches up so that the base of the petal
      measures
      3 inches. Since the soft outer edge of this type of petal is on the straight
      instead of the bias of the fabric, each petal has a decidedly cupped appearance
    when placed around a circular foundation.</p>
    <p> Cut a circular crinoline foundation. When placing the petals for the
      finished flower, proceed exactly as in Fig. 57 except that the petal edges
      should
      be placed upright instead of flat. The petals in this rose, like the rolled
      petals, may be made in a variety of sizes. If a shallow rose is desired,
      the petals may be decreased in width, but with length added; if a deep
      rose is wanted, the width of the petal may be increased, always using individual
      judgment as to the length of the base of the petal if these changes are
    made.</p>
    <h4> <strong><em><a href="illust/059.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,720);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/059-t.jpg" alt="Figure 59" width="155" height="131" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Soft Folded Rose</strong></h4>
    <h6><strong>Figure 59. Two types of folded roses. <em>A,</em> crinoline base with
      cotton-padded center circle of silk; <em>B</em>, bias strip to be used
      for fold; <em>C</em>, soft folded rose; <em>D,</em> tailored folded rose.</strong></h6>
    <p> Decide upon the size for the finished rose and cut a circular crinoline
      base according to this measurement. The base of the rose (Fig. 59, <em>C</em>)
      is 2&frac34;
    inches in diameter.</p>
    <p> Upon this crinoline foundation place a small amount of cotton for the
      center padding (<em>A</em>). Next cut a circle of fabric, the exact size
      of the crinoline
    circle. Attach the two circles with a basting stitch around the outer edge.</p>
    <p> Cut bias strips 1&frac12; inches wide to form the center folds, the three
      extreme outer folds being 2&frac12; inches wide, the extra inch forming
      the finish
      over the edge. These bias strips and the center covering may be of the
      same material
    or of contrasting materials and colors.</p>
    <p> When the crinoline base is prepared, start placing the folds so that
      a perfect triangle is formed at the center of the rose, with each fold
      cut
      off evenly
      with the outer edge of the circle. Continue placing these folds slightly
      below each other, and rather loosely for a soft effect 
      (always keeping the perfect triangle in mind), until the base is filled
      and the finish at the outer edge is to be made. The finishing folds are
      placed
      (one at a time, as the preceding folds were placed) with the ends brought
      to the under side of the crinoline base. They should be fastened instead
      of being trimmed at the outer edge. The raw edge of each finishing fold
    is caught to the crinoline base.</p>
    <h4> <strong>Tailored Folded Rose</strong></h4>
    <p> Although the process in making the tailored folded rose is exactly the
      same as that described for Fig. 59, <em>C</em>, the bias strips are pulled very
      snug to
      form the flat, tailored effect, and the center is padded with less cotton.
      These roses are most effective when several are made in different sizes
      and grouped as a single ornament. They may be made with centers of various
      colors,
      added after the flower is completed or while it is being made. This type
      of rose is very appropriate for the mourning bonnet or hat, as it is inconspicuous
    when made in black, yet has dignity because of the regular, folded lines.</p>
    <h4> <strong><em><a href="illust/060.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',478,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/060-t.jpg" alt="Figure 60" width="220" height="120" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Rolled Rose</strong></h4>
    <p> This type of rose lends itself particularly well to lightweight fabrics,
      such as satin or soft silk, for it should have a soft, fluffy appearance
    when completed.</p>
    <h6><strong>Figure 60. Soft rolled rose. <em>A</em>, first bias fold attached to
      crinoline foundation; <em>B</em>, completed rose.</strong></h6>
    <p> Cut bias strips from 2 to 5 inches in width (the strip shown in Fig.
      60, <em>A</em>, is 2 inches) and join into one strip of from 1 to 1&frac12; yards
      in length.
      Press the seams open 
      and fold the raw edges of the bias strip together, catching with large
      basting stitches. This permits the winding of the fold into place and keeps
      it from
    pulling crooked.</p>
    <p> Cut a crinoline foundation (Fig.60, <em>A</em>). This foundation may be wired
      at the edge with very fine tie wire to hold it firmly in place and to make
      it possible
      to shape the flower against the crown without extra sewing. Also the foundation
      will be neater if it is covered with a piece of satin or silk to match
    the flower.</p>
    <p> Start the rose by attaching the first row of bias to the outer edge of
      the crinoline. Keep working toward the center, holding the folds so that
      the
      edges will roll slightly and give depth to the flower. 
      Continue the fold until the center is nearly filled; then make a small
      hole in the crinoline foundation through which to slip the end of the fold.
      This
      makes a simple but very neat finish. The center may also be decorated with
      wooden beads or with French knots made of gold or silver thread, heavy
    floss, or yarn.</p>
    <h4> <strong><em><a href="illust/061.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,330);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/061-t.jpg" alt="Figure 61" width="140" height="245" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Bias-strip, Corded-edge Rose</strong></h4>
    <h6><strong>Figure 61. Rose made of bias rolled petals, with cord at edge. <em>A</em>,
      cord whipped to edge of petal to form foundation of roll; <em>B</em>, completed
      rose.</strong></h6>
    <p> Cut five bias strips of silk 4 inches wide and 5 inches long. To one
      lengthwise edge of each strip sew a length of cable cord, twine, or yarn
      so that the
      silk may be rolled, as soft fabrics will not stay in place when cut on
      the bias unless some support is afforded (Fig. 61,<em> A</em>). Roll the silk over
      the
    cord, turning about three times.</p>
    <p> Form the petals by holding the bias fold between the finger and the thumb
      of the right hand and, with the left hand, folding the bottom of the strip
      into small folds. Secure by twisting thread around the folds, then cutting
      away any extra material to form the square base, as in <a href="#fig56">Fig.
      56</a>. A small
      crinoline foundation of not more than 
      1 &frac12; inches in diameter is used for this flower; it should be just large
      enough to attach the base of the petals firmly to it. For the center finish
      use a twist of silk over cable cord or yarn, working from the outer edge
      toward the center. More than one layer of petals may be used, as in the
    other types of rolled roses.</p>
    <h4 class="clear"> <strong><em><a href="illust/062.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',589,443);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/062-t.jpg" alt="Figure 62" width="140" height="152" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Upright Rose</strong></h4>
    <h6><strong>Figure 62. Upright rose made of rolled petals cut from squares.</strong></h6>
    <p> Make petals as for Fig. 55. When building this rose, the petals are placed
      upright in position instead of flat, lapping one over the other in perfect
      succession. If any form of stamen is to be used, it must be placed in the
      center before all the petals are in position. The rolled edge of the petal
    may be placed on the outside or the inside when forming the rose.</p>
    <h4 class="clear"> <strong><em><a href="illust/063.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,293);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/063-t.jpg" alt="Figure 63" width="120" height="232" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Morning-glories</strong></h4>
    <h6><strong>Figure 63. Morning-glories (tailored). <em>A,</em> triangle forming one
      half of lower; <em>B</em>, completed flower.</strong></h6>
    <p> Fig. 63 shows a simple type of morning-glory, one that may be placed
      flat around the crown or on the brim of a hat. Each flower overlaps the
      one
      preceding it enough 
      to hide the base of the flower. It also may be used in combination with
      other flowers, and it may be made of a single color or lined with a contrasting
      one. Cut a 3-inch square of silk. If only one color is to be used, fold
      the
      square into a triangle; if using two colors, cut each square to form triangles
    and join color to color (<a href="#fig56">Fig. 56, <em>A</em></a>).</p>
    <p> Place the wrong side of the seamed or folded points together, forming
      another triangle, and seam the raw edges together, leaving at the lower
      point just
      enough opening to turn to the right side. Turn the flower, with 
      the facing and the outside in their respective places. Yarn or floss may
      be knotted to form the center decoration in place of the stiffer type of
      stamen. Use two or three strands, according to the weight of the floss
      or yarn, tying knots at intervals of every four inches. Fold, with the
      knot
    at the top of each loop.</p>
    <p> When one color only is used, the construction is the same as above, except
      that there is no seam along the bias edge of the first triangle, as in
    Fig. 63, <em>B</em>.</p>
    <h4 class="clear"> <strong><em><a href="illust/064.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,399);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/064-t.jpg" alt="Figure 64" width="150" height="220" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Morning-glory formed of Shaped Petals</strong></h4>
    <h6><strong>Figure 64. Morning-glory (soft). <em>A</em>, shaped piece forming one
      petal of flower; <em>B</em>, completed flower.</strong></h6>
    <p> Cut a strip of paper 5 inches long and 3 inches wide. Fold in half along
      the length of the strip. Start cutting 
      half an inch from the fold at the lower end of the strip and, sloping gradually
      outward, when 1 inch from the opposite end of the strip make a decided
      flare to the top edge of the petal pattern. This forms the curved outer
      edge of
    the flower.</p>
    <p> Six of these petals are made and joined with French seams. The outer
      edge is bound with a narrow bias or straight binding. Fine tie wire may
      be run
      in each seam if desired; 
      especially is this convenient where the flower is to stand slightly away
      from the brim or the crown of the hat. The binding at the outer edge may
      be made of contrasting fabric or color. The unfinished ends are drawn together,
      and a wire is fastened to them to form a stem. This stem is wound tightly
    with a narrow bias strip of the fabric.</p>
    <h3 class="clear"> <a name="leav" id="leav"></a>LEAVES</h3>
    <p> The leaves used for trimming hats come in a great variety of shapes,
      sizes, and materials. They may be cut of a single thickness of the material,
      with
      the edges unfinished or bound with narrow bias bindings; they may be cut
      double thickness, with the seam at the outer edge so that it may be turned
      and pressed flat; they may be made with stiffening or without; and they
      may 
      be shirred or folded into the desired shape. The size, shape, and width
      are all determined by the type of hat or the kind of flower with which
      they are
      to be used. In fact, the designing of leaf forms is so simple that almost
    anyone may cut a simple pattern according to his own needs.</p>

    <h6><strong>Figure 65. Triangular folded leaf. <em>A</em>, folded square, first step; <em>B</em>,

    <p> Cut a 4-inch square of fabric; fold in half, with the fold at the top
    (Fig. 65, <em>A</em>).</p>
    <p> Bring the right-hand point of the folded edge down to the center of the
      half square. Next bring the left-hand point down to meet the first, being
      accurate
      as to the center. This brings all the raw edges at the bottom of the small
    triangle.</p>
    <p> Fold the triangle into a smaller triangle by creasing at the center,
      where the folds meet. This makes a leaf with a flared bias edge on one
      side and
      a straight edge on the other side when the base of the leaf is laid in
    small folds.</p>
    <p> If the leaf is to be left open, as in <em>B</em>, run a thread along the base
    of the leaf, shirring slightly.</p>

      strip folded end to end and edges sewed; <em>C</em>, completed leaf.</strong></h6>
    <p> Cut a strip of bias 6 inches long and 1&frac12; inches wide, and fold
      lengthwise.</p>
    <p> Double the folded strip end to end. Run a shirr thread along the raw
      lengthwise edge of the strip where the four thicknesses of the fabric are
      brought
    together.</p>
    <p> Unfold. The seam will run directly down the center, representing the
      two halves of the leaf. Pull the shirr thread slightly to form the rounded
    tip, and fasten the thread.</p>
    <p> Where narrow leaves will fit in particularly well, this leaf is always
      attractive. If bias strips are not possible, this leaf may be made from
      straight strips,
      although the finished leaf is somewhat less graceful than the one made
      from the bias strips. Both width and length may be added to this leaf if
    necessary.</p>

    <h6><strong>Figure 67. Shirred leaf. <em>A</em>, cable cord at center of leaf, fullness
      drawn up; <em>B</em>, finished leaf.</strong></h6>
    <p>Cut a strip of fabric 6 inches long and 3 inches wide. Fold in half lengthwise
      over small cable cord. Place running stitches close to the cable cord,
      but do not catch the cord, as both cord and thread are to be adjusted on
      a crinoline
      foundation. This foundation is 4 inches long and 1&frac12; inches wide
      at the widest point, which is directly at the center (for shaping a crinoline
    foundation see <em>A</em>, <a href="#fig58">Fig. 58</a>).</p>
    <p> Pull the shirr thread to the exact length of the crinoline foundation.
      Fasten each end and adjust the gathers 
      evenly. Catch the cord to the foundation at several places to prevent its
      slipping from the center of the leaf. Bring the raw edges of the fabric
    over the sides of the foundation and secure underneath.</p>
    <p> If plain velvet leaves are to be used, they may be veined by heating
      the point of a nut pick or other pointed instrument and running it over
      the
      surface of the leaf to outline the design of a vein. The hot metal merely
      irons or
    flattens the nap of the velvet.</p>

      of velvet or silk may also be pasted on a foundation of black or white
      crinoline, according to the color of the fabric, and faced with
      the
      same
      or contrasting 
      color or material. If this is done, the three layers&#8212;top, crinoline,
      and facing&#8212;are pasted together. On this surface lay the pattern
      of the leaf and cut, leaving the edges unfinished. Patterns for plain leaves
    are found in Figure 68.</p>
    <h3 class="clear"> <a name="fruit" id="fruit"></a>FRUIT ORNAMENTS</h3>
    <p> Fruit ornaments are made in as many different forms as are flower ornaments.
      The most popular fruits to imitate, however, are grapes and apples. The
      grapes are made in cluster formation, resembling the natural fruit. The
      apples are
      round in design and decorated in numberless ways. Hand painting, a few
      French knots placed at the center to represent the bud end of the apple,
      or strappings
      of heavy floss or any decorative thread to divide the apple into sections
      may be used. Both of these fruits may be made from many different materials,
    ranging in texture from georgette to velvet, felts, and leather.</p>
    <p> These fruits may be so used that the trimming is formed entirely of one
      kind of fruit, or there may be a combination of fruits or even of fruits
      and flowers.
      They are made in large and small sizes, the number required depending entirely
    upon the size of each independent grape or apple.</p>
    <h4> <strong>Grapes</strong></h4>
    <p> Grapes may be made from very tiny pieces of fabric. It is often possible
      to use pieces so small, in fact, that they might seem worthless; but when
      all these small pieces are cut, shaped, and made into clusters, they are
    most attractive.</p>
    <h4> <strong><em><a href="illust/069.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,210);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/069-t.jpg" alt="Figure 69" width="140" height="297" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="folded" id="folded"></a>Grapes made from Folded Circles of Silk</strong></h4>
    <h6><strong>Figure 69. Grapes made from folded circle of silk. <em>A</em>,
        circle folded with shirr thread at circular edge; <em>B</em>,
      shirr thread pulled up ready for attaching grape to crinoline foundation; <em>C</em>,
      completed cluster of grapes.</strong></h6>
    <p> Cut a circle of silk 2&frac12; inches in diameter and fold in half, the fold
      coming on the straight thread of the material. 
    Run a shirr thread along the curved side, or where the raw edges meet.</p>
    <p> The grape is formed by drawing the shirr thread into place and leaving
    the base spread apart to a distance of &frac12; inch.</p>
    <p> Cut a crinoline foundation upon which to build a grape cluster. This
      foundation should be as long and as wide as the finished cluster is to
      be; after attaching
      the grapes any extra crinoline may be trimmed away at the outer edge. Place
      one grape at the point, attaching this to the crinoline foundation. Follow
      with two more grapes, and work in this way toward the broad end, overlapping
      as much as is necessary to conceal the raw edge of the preceding grape.
      Widen by adding an extra grape to the row and decrease by taking one or
      more away.
      Finish by 
      folding a grape over the unfinished edges. Some type of leaf, if preferred,
    may be added (see <em><a href="#leav">Leaves</a></em>).</p>
    <h4 class="clear"> <strong><em><a href="illust/070.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,207);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/070-t.jpg" alt="Figure 70" width="134" height="294" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Grapes made over Old Buttons or Button Molds</strong></h4>
    <p> Fig. 70 shows how to make a cluster of grapes from one piece of silk.
    It also shows that it is not always necessary to make each grape separately.</p>
    <h6><strong>Figure 70. Showing grapes made over buttons. <em>A</em>, button tied
      inside of fabric; <em>B</em>, buttons ready for forming of cluster, and
      outer finish.</strong></h6>
    <p> Take a piece of silk large enough to form the entire grape cluster without
      cutting. This, of course, varies according to the size of the buttons to
      be used. Place a button on the wrong side of the fabric and pull the silk
      very tightly over it. Secure the silk at the base of the button by twisting
      the thread tightly around the 
      fullness. Take a stitch to complete the fastening, but do not cut the thread.
      Place a second button far enough from the first to permit the buttons (or
      grapes) to be moved about when shaping the cluster. Bring the thread from
      the first to the second grape and fasten again, leaving the thread slightly
      slack between each grape. Continue until enough grapes are placed for the
      cluster. Arrange the buttons close together and in grape-cluster formation.
      Trim away the extra silk at the outer edge, leaving just enough to turn
    for the finish.</p>
    <p> These grapes may be stuffed with cotton instead of using buttons; but
      if cotton is used, the greatest care must be taken when molding it into
      balls
      to 
      see that the size of the balls is uniform; otherwise the grape cluster
      will be irregular in the grouping. If many colors are to be used in the
      cluster,
      each grape must be made separately and the cluster arranged in the color
    combination desired.</p>
    <p> When using button molds, place an extra thickness of the fabric over
      the opening on the top of the mold to prevent a ridge showing through the
      outer
    covering.</p>
    <h4 class="clear"> <strong><em><a href="illust/071.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,259);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/071-t.jpg" alt="Figure 71" width="120" height="240" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Grapes of Velvet made over Buckram Circles and Padded 
    with Cotton</strong></h4>
    <h6><strong>Figure 71. Grapes made over buckram circle. <em>A</em>, buckram circle
      placed on fabric circle; <em>B</em>, finished grape; <em>C</em>, completed
      grape cluster. </strong></h6>
    <p>Mark circles for a single-grape foundation by placing the base of an
      ordinary thimble on a piece of buckram and outlining the edge with pencil.
      Mark
      as many 
      circles as the worker decides will be required and cut each foundation
      from the larger piece of buckram. Place these small circles of buckram
      on the
      scraps of velvet and cut, allowing from &frac14; to 3/8 inch for turning over
      the buckram foundation for a finish. Run a shirr thread at the edge of
      the circle; but before this is drawn into place, pad the buckram circle
      with
    a small amount of cotton.</p>
    <p> Draw velvet over the padded buckram circle and fasten on the under side,
    forming a neat, smooth edge.</p>
    <p> Cut a crinoline foundation as for <a href="#folded">folded-silk grapes</a> and
      build the cluster in exactly the same manner. However, as each grape is
      finished
    completely before placing it in the cluster, no final finish is required.</p>
    <h4> <strong>Apples</strong></h4>
    <p> Apples may be made very flat or they may be made well rounded, according
      to the base upon which they are built or the amount of cotton which is
    used for the filling. Since the flat apples give the appearance of less weight
      than do the ones tightly padded with cotton, they may be made larger in
      circumference,
      but
    this circle is seldom over 2 inches in diameter when finished.</p>
    <p> Color combinations are easily worked out when planning the groupings.
      The individual apples may be made of different shades of silk and then
      arranged
    artistically on the hat.</p>
    <h4 class="clear"> <strong><em><a href="illust/072.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,627);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/072-t.jpg" alt="Figure 72" width="160" height="143" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Types of Apples</strong></h4>

      with heavy floss; <em>C</em>, group of tightly filled small apples with
      French knot showing bud end of each; <em>D</em>, tightly padded apples
      divided into sections by lighter-weight floss and French knots at center; <em>E</em>,
      flat applies built on stiff foundation.</strong></h6>
    <p>If the apple is to have a soft appearance a stiff foundation is not needed.
      Decide upon the size of apple desired and then cut a circle of silk accordingly.
      If the apple is to measure 1&frac14; inches in diameter when finished,
      the circle of fabric should be 2&frac12; inches in diameter. A shirr thread
      is then run
      around the outer edge of the circle. Take a bunch of cotton and roll into
      a soft ball. Place this in the center of the fabric circle and draw up
    the shirr thread to inclose the cotton.</p>
    <p> A soft apple may be divided into sections by heavy floss, as in Fig.
      72,<em> B</em>; these may also be placed in groups of three or more, as shown in
    <em>D</em>.</p>
    <p> A group of tightly filled small apples may be arranged with black-silk
      floss used for one French knot to outline the bud end of each apple (Fig.
      72, <em>C</em>).
    These are combined with leaves as a background (see <em><a href="#leav">Leaves</a></em>).</p>
    <h4> <strong>Flat Apples built on a Stiff Foundation</strong></h4>
    <p> The apples shown in Fig. 72, <em>E</em>, are made from a pair of old
      white kid gloves, and are ready to be painted in contrasting colors with
      oil paints.
      White
      or black oil-cloth or pieces of leather may be used in the same way. Cut
      a circle of crinoline or buckram the desired size for the foundation (large
      and small
      sizes may
      be used in the same grouping), pad the foundation slightly, cut the 
      outer circle to form the covering (<em>A</em>), and finish with one or
      more French knots at the center or toward the edge of the apple, according
      to the view
      of the apple to be brought out. Leaves of the same material are added to
    relieve the plainness of the edge and to give rhythm to the finished ornament.</p>
    <h3> <a name="felt" id="felt"></a>FELT FLOWERS AND FRUITS</h3>
    <p> Felt ornaments are the simplest of all trimmings to construct, for the
      edges need no finishing, as felt does not ravel when cut. Felt comes in
      many lovely
      colors; and when these colors are combined artistically, the result is
      most satisfactory.</p>

    <p>Cut a circle 3&frac34; inches in diameter from a <a href="mp-18-patt.html#draft">square
        of tissue paper</a>. Without unfolding, cut the 
      circumference into symmetrical points which extend on both sides almost
      to the center of the circle. Using this paper as a pattern, cut the figure
      from
    a piece of felt.</p>
    <p> Cut a second felt circle, somewhat smaller, of contrasting color and
      place on top of the first circle. For the center finish of this flower
      make three
      piles of felt circles of three or four circles each, the large ones at
      the base being 1&frac14; inches in diameter and the others decreasing in
      size so
      that when they are piled all the 
      colors may be seen. Cover a wire with yarn and attach it to the back of
    the flower for a stem.</p>
    <p> The colors used in the completed flower shown in Fig. 73 are as follows:
      the foundation circle, gray-blue; the next circle, soft light green; of
      the piles of circles for the center finish, the large one is violet, with
      dark
      red, Chinese red, and tan 
    in order; tan yarn is used for the center knot and stem.</p>

    <p> Organdie ornaments, like those of felt, are individual.
      The materials are stiff in texture, and all flower edges are rolled easily
      either on the straight or on the bias of the material. Organdie flowers
      are only for the 
      summer season, when organdie or other transparent summer hats are being
      worn, or as trimmings for light dresses. They may be made after the fashion
      of

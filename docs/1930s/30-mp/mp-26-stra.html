  <h2><a name="straw" id="straw"></a>STRAW BRAIDS AND HORSEHAIR BRAIDS</h2>
    <h3> STRAW BRAIDS</h3>
    <p> <strong>Brim tops. </strong>If both the top and the facing are to be
      made of the braid, the top is made first. Start the braid 2 inches to the
      right of the center
        back
    of the brim, folding the braid over the edge, with one half extending on
    each side. Work from right to left, sewing the braid entirely around the
    edge with stab stitches of even length. When the back is reached for the
    second time, 
    start a spiral of braid by bringing the loose end of the braid to the top
    of the brim and sloping gradually to meet the lower edge of the braid already
    attached (Fig. 135). <strong><em><a href="illust/135.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,491);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/135-t.jpg" alt="Figure 135" width="150" height="148" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em></strong>The stitch now changes to a long-and-short stitch, with
    the long stitch on the facing side of the brim. 
    In sewing, lap the braid just enough to catch the two edges together securely.
    The shirr thread at the lower edge of the braid must be drawn up after every
    row of braid is attached, so that the braid will lie perfectly smooth. Continue
    around the brim until the narrowest part of it is filled. If it is irregular
    in shape; fill in all the 
    parts not covered with small lengths of the braid, forming crescent-shaped
    pieces. Attach the end of the braid to the head-size band when starting and
    ending the crescent (Fig. 135).</p>
    <h6><strong>Figure 135. Back of brim made from straw braid, showing the spiral at
      the back, and the side of the brim with crescent attached to head-size
    band. Threads shown are those used in pulling braid into place.</strong></h6>
    <p class="clear"> <strong>Facings.</strong> The facing is covered in the same manner as the top, though
      a slanting stitch is used for attaching the braid. These stitches are concealed
      between
    the two layers of braid. The ends of the braid are attached to the inside
    of the head-size band or the crown.</p>
    <p> <strong>Combination brims.</strong> Straw braid may be used for either
      the top or the facing of the brim, and piece fabric for the other side.
      In either case
      the braid
    is attached first and the fabric last, so that the stitches holding the braid
    in place may be brought through the brim and 
    there concealed by the fabric. Additional combinations may be obtained by
    using the braid for only half of either the facing or the top (see <em><a href="mp-11-faci.html">Facings</a></em>).</p>
    <p class="clear"> <strong><em><a href="illust/136.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',487,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/136-t.jpg" alt="Figure 136" width="200" height="108" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Crown covering attached to a fabric foundation.</strong> Start the braid
    at the base of the crown 2 inches to the right of the center back and attach
    with the long-and-short stitch, making a spiral as in covering the brim (Fig.
    135) Continue until the top of the crown is reached (Fig. 136), cut a slash
    at the crown top, and pull the braid through the opening. This eliminates
    all bulk at the top of the crown when finishing.</p>
    <h6><strong>Figure 136. Attaching straw braid to a fabric crown. At left, straw braid
      started at base of crown, showing spiral at center back. At right, top
      finish of straw-braid crown.</strong></h6>
    <p class="clear"><strong> <em><a href="illust/137.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,398);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/137-t.jpg" alt="Figure 137" width="139" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Crown covering without a fabric foundation.</strong> When making
      a soft crown, it is most convenient to pin the braid into place over a
      crown block or
      a fabric
    crown. In this 
    process, pins are used to hold the braid together while the crown is being
    modeled on the block; no sewing is done until the modeling is completed.
    A small running stitch is then used. If neither a block nor a fabric crown
    is available, a plaque may be started, forming the top 
    of the crown, and the side crown be shaped as the braid is sewed (Fig. 137).</p>
    <h6><strong>Figure 137. Beginning of braid plaque.</strong></h6>
    <p class="clear"> When the top of the crown is covered with a plain fabric, it is put in
      place first (<a href="mp-08-crow.html#fig22">Fig. 22</a>). The braid is
      then started at the top of the side
    crown, 2 inches to the right of the center back, as at the base of the crown,
    overlapping the raw edges of the fabric top. In this case the braid follows
    down toward the 
    base of the crown instead of upward to the top. The end of the braid is turned
    up inside the crown and fastened. The long-and-short stitch is used in attaching
    the braid throughout, the long part of the stitch placed on the inside of
    the crown, with the short part of the stitch holding the braid in place.</p>
    <h3> HORSEHAIR BRAIDS</h3>
    <p> Transparent braids are usually made over a wire frame, but they may be
        attached to a solid fabric foundation. The method of attaching is different,
    however.</p>
    <p><strong> Wire brim for a foundation.</strong> Two methods of placing braid on the brim
    are used:</p>
    <p> 1. Start the braid 2 inches to the right of the center back, letting
        it extend over the edge for a distance of 1 or more inches, according
        to the width
    of the braid and to individual preference. Attach the braid to the circumference
    wire with a lock stitch, catching into the covering of the wire with the
      first stitch to hold it securely (<a href="mp-02-bind.html#fig3">Fig. 3</a>).
      Then make the spiral as in the straw-braid brim covering (see <em><a href="#straw">Straw
      Braids</a></em>) and use the running stitch for the sewing of the succeeding
      rows of braid.</p>
    <p class="clear"> <strong><em><a href="illust/138.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,484);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/138-t.jpg" alt="Figure 138" width="140" height="150" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em></strong>2. Start the braid 1 inch to the right of the center back, attaching
    by the same method as in 1. As the back of the brim is reached, 
    carry the braid past the back wire spoke for a distance of 1 inch (Fig. 138).
    Then lap the braid flat instead of making a spiral. Each succeeding row is
    attached in the same way at the base of the one above, lapping only enough
    to fasten it securely. Any spaces remaining uncovered may be filled in with
    crescents as with straw braids (Fig. 135).</p>
    <h6><strong>Figure 138. Transparent brim. Top covering of horsehair braid, showing
      extension of braid beyond the edge wire, and the two-inch flat braid lapping
      at the back of the brim.</strong></h6>
    <p class="clear"><strong> Over a fabric foundation. </strong>Cover the fabric foundation with light-weight
      material in the same or a contrasting color. Attach the braid in the same
      manner as
    in straw-braid covering (Fig. 135).</p>
    <p> <strong>Crown covering of horsehair braid without a fabric foundation.</strong> The braid
    for the crown should be pinned over a crown block or over a fabric crown,
    starting at the base and working upward. After the pinning is done, remove
    the braid crown from the block and sew the braid together with a running
    stitch.</p>
    <p> When fabric foundations are used, both brim and crown may be covered
      with horsehair braid by the same process as that used for <a href="#straw">straw
    braids</a>.</p>

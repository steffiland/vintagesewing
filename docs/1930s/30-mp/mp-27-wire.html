  <h2> USES OF WIRE</h2>
    <h3> <a name="kind" id="kind"></a>Kinds of Wire used in Millinery</h3>
    <p> The most common wires used in millinery are cable, frame, lace, and tie
      wire. These come in both black and white and are covered with silk, mercerized,
    or cotton thread.</p>
    <p><strong> Cable wire</strong> is the heaviest and stiffest of these wires.
      It is sometimes used for an outside decoration, but is usually employed
      for large cord
      edges,
    for the head-size wire circles, and for the circumference wire of brims to
    be used for blocks. It may be purchased in colors as well as in black and
    white.</p>
    <p><strong> Frame wire</strong> is used in the making of frames for transparent hats, in the
      wiring of brim edges, and in any part of the frame where stiffness is desired.
      It
    is less stiff and much smaller than cable wire, however.</p>
    <p> <strong>Lace wire</strong> may be used in wiring brims and crowns where only slight stiffness
    is wanted. It is also much used in the wiring of transparent bows.</p>
    <p> <strong>Ribbon wire</strong> is almost indispensable in the construction
      of certain types of curved frames. It is made of two 
    strips of cotton fabric with small wires pasted between. Ribbon wire may
    be purchased in many widths, though the two-wire width is the one most commonly
    used.</p>
    <p> <strong>Tie wire</strong> is used in the construction of wire frames for tying the heavier
    wires together, for making flowers and ornaments, and for wiring where only
    very slight stiffness is desired.</p>
    <p> All the different kinds of wire used in hat-making may be purchased by
      the bolt except tie wire, which comes wound on spools. When opening a bolt,
      be
    very careful not to remove all the tie threads at once or the bolt will unroll
    too rapidly and spring out of shape. Wire should be handled firmly but lightly,
    for kinks pressed into it are most difficult to straighten. It is always
    wise to clip the wire from the bolt by a pair of wire nippers or pliers.</p>
    <h4 class="clear"> <strong><em><a href="illust/139.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,589);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/139-t.jpg" alt="Figure 139" width="140" height="140" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Wire Frames</strong></h4>
    <p> Wire frames are used for constructing wire-frame blocks (see <em><a href="mp-03-bloc.html">Blocking</a></em>,).
      They are also used as the foundation of the transparent hat (Fig. 139).</p>
    <h3> <a name="brim" id="brim"></a>Construction of the Brim for the Transparent Hat</h3>
    <p> Measure the exact head size (see <em><a href="mp-16-meas.html">Measurements</a></em>)
      plus a 2-inch lapping on each head-size circle. The head size consists
      of two wire
        circles standing
    1 inch apart. The upper circle should be half an inch smaller than the lower
    to conform to the upper curve of the head. In measuring the proper length
    of wire for these circles, run the tape measure along the upper side of the
    wire as it is unrolled from the bolt. Do not measure from the lower side
    of the wire on account of the slightly concave surface.</p>
    <p> Join the wire lengths in circles lapping 2 inches, and tie the lapped
      wire with tie wire. Two of the wire threads are used for the binding of
      the lapped
    wires&#8212;one wound around each end of the 2-inch lappings (Fig. 141).
    In joining the lappings the tie wire is folded around the head-size wire
    only once and twisted by the nippers. The manner of handling the nippers
    is important, as the 
    tie wires are frail and are easily broken. The tie wire must be caught between
    the nippers at a sufficient distance from the head-size wire to prevent it
    from breaking as it tightens. </p>
    <p class="clear">The two head circles, which are to form the
    1-inch headband, are placed one above the other, the larger circle 
    at the bottom and the smaller circle at the top, and are set together by
    eight wire spokes placed at equal distances around the band. To insure accuracy,
    the head circles are marked for the placing of these spokes. Beginning at
    the center of the lapped wires (which always are placed at the back of the
    hat), measure one half the actual distance of the head size, thus marking
    the half section. The marking of the fourths and eighths follows (Fig. 140).
    The length of the spoke always is determined by the width of the brim plus
    3 inches for the turnings and the headband; thus a 3-inch frame requires
    a spoke 6 inches in length. To join the head-size 
    circles the spokes are bent 1 inch horizontal (to attach to the upper circle)
    followed by 1-inch vertical (for band 
    uprights) followed by 4 inches horizontal (for brim foundation) (Fig. 142);
    and the remaining inch is turned upright for attaching the circumference,
    or outer brim, circle. All the spokes are attached to the lower head-size
    circle first and are carefully adjusted to the spokes 
    at the exact markings on the circle. This is done by placing the lower head
    circle in the angle formed by the 1-inch vertical and the 4-inch horizontal,
    the circle being held 
    in place by twisting the 4-inch horizontal around the circle wire (Fig. 141).    It will be difficult to keep the wires from slipping unless the thumb and
    first finger of the right hand are held firmly against the wire at the head-size
    circle while the turning is being done. When the 
    lower circle is in place, the upper circle of the headband is placed in the
    angle formed by the 1-inch horizontal and the 1-inch vertical, care again
    being taken to follow 
    the corresponding markings, and the same process of joining is followed.
    When completed, the head size must be oblong instead of round. In the final
    fitting slip the oblong band over the head, using the fingers to press the
    wire gently into the shape of the head.</p>
    <h6 class="clear"><strong><em><a href="illust/140.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,635);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/140-t.jpg" alt="Figure 140" width="140" height="131" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Figure 140.

      spokes are attached.</strong></h6>
    <h6 class="clear"><strong><em><a href="illust/141.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,662);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/141-t.jpg" alt="Figure 141" width="150" height="112" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Figure 141. Wire head-size circles showing the two-inch
        lapping at the back and
        method
        of
        joining
        spokes to
        the head-size
        circles.</strong></h6>
    <h6 class="clear"><strong><em><a href="illust/142.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',261,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/142-t.jpg" alt="Figure 142" width="220" height="82" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Figure 142. Wire-brim spoke bent for joining to the head-size circles.</strong></h6>
    <p class="clear"> After the headband has been fitted, adjust the brim wire. For a <em>drooping
    brim</em> gently turn the wire spoke downward, and by a slight pressure of
    the thumb and the first finger shape it as desired. For an upturned brim
    do the
    reverse. See that all the brim spokes are tightly 
    clamped. The nippers may be used to press the turnings firmly into place.
    The greatest trouble at this point of frame-making is in keeping the brim
    spokes in a direct line from the head size to the outer circle. This may
    be accomplished with less difficulty if a reenforcing wire is run around
    the top of the brim spokes not more than &frac34; of an inch from the head size,
    caught to each spoke with the tie wire, lapped 2 inches in the back to correspond
    to the head-size lappings, and secured as were the head-size lappings with
    the tie wire.</p>
    <p> The frame is now ready for adjustment of the brim's outer circle. Measure
    enough wire for the circle, allowing 2 inches for lapping in the back. Place
    this wire at the brim edge, in the angle formed by the 4-inch horizontal
    and the final 1-inch vertical, as was done in 
    attaching the head size. Do not clamp tightly until the frame is perfect.
    Place another reenforcing wire halfway between the outer brim and the head
    size. The frame is then finished unless the removal of the first reenforcing
    wire is desired. This wire has now performed its duty and may be removed.
    To eliminate waste and secure even lengths of the tie wire, roll the wire
    from the spool around the tips of the first two fingers of the left hand
    and cut the wound wires at the top, bottom, and each side of the fingers.
    The result is four small bunches of wire threads of equal and desired length.
    Wire foundations are almost never used for the crowns of transparent hats
    because they are stiff and unbecoming. Instead soft crowns are used with
    the transparent-brim hat.</p>
    <h3> <a name="fab" id="fab"></a>Wiring Fabric Frames</h3>
    <p> <strong>Brim edge. </strong>Measure around the brim edge for the length of wire needed,
        plus a 1-inch lapping. Clip off the wire with nippers. This wire should
        be straightened
    out as nearly as possible to conform to the line of the hat before starting
    to sew it to the brim, as curled wire is extremely hard to manage. The straightening
    of the wire is accomplished by placing the wire between the thumb and the
    first finger of the right hand and, holding the end of the wire firmly in
    the left hand, running the thumb and the first finger very lightly back and
    forth over the wire until all the slight indentations have been removed.</p>
    <p> As all wire lappings on fabric frames are 1 inch, start the wire about
      half an inch to the right of the center back. When the wiring is completed,
      the
    1-inch wire lapping will be directly at the back of the hat. The
    wire is always placed at the edge and on the top of the brim so that it may
    not interfere with the finishing at the edge of the brim when the brim is
    covered. Fasten the end very securely so it will not become loose as the
    work proceeds. The wire is attached to the frame by using a lock stitch &frac34;
    of an inch long. This is chosen because the lock in the stitch fastens the
    wire so securely that there is no possible chance of its slipping away from
    the brim edge (<a href="mp-02-bind.html#fig3">Fig. 3</a>). The wire is carried
    around the entire circumference of the brim, and, after lapping, the second
    end is fastened as was the first.
    Be careful neither to stretch the brim nor to &quot;full&quot; the wire as
    it is being attached. If this is done, the result will be a waving of the
    brim, and the wire must be taken off and readjusted. Cover the wire with
    a narrow bias binding (<a href="mp-02-bind.html#fig3">Fig. 3</a>).</p>
    <h4 class="clear"> <strong><em><a href="illust/143.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,550);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/143-t.jpg" alt="Figure 143" width="140" height="156" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Reenforcing Wire</strong></h4>
    <p> The reenforcing wire is run halfway between the outer brim line and the
        head-size oval and is used only when 
      necessary. The more expensive frames seldom need this extra wire, but
        the cheaper frames usually require it. It is used to hold the frame firmly
        enough
    to carry a smooth covering without giving way entirely or becoming limp when
    worn in extreme dampness. If this wire is to be used, it is put on the top
    of all hats 
    except those of the mushroom (drooping) type; in these it is placed underneath
    the brim on account of the 
    shadow which is thrown by the droop and which hides the wire. The lock stitch
    again is used, but the small part of the stitch is placed over the wire and
    the greater length runs along the opposite side. If the reenforcing is used,
    it is covered with a narrow piece of bias crinoline.</p>
    <h3> <a name="rib" id="rib"></a>Use of Ribbon Wire</h3>
    <p> Ribbon wire is cut in lengths equal to the width of the brim plus 1 inch
    for &quot;anchor&quot; tabs. These strips are sewed to the brim, and the
    tabs are attached firmly to the crown. Any desired curve or droop of the
    brim can then be obtained by bending these strips of ribbon wire (<a href="mp-17-mode.html#fig83">Fig.
    83</a>).</p>

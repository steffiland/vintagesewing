<span class="small">by Carlotta M. Brown</span></h1>
  <h2> FOLDS</h2>
    <p> Folds are strips of bias material used as a finish or a trimming. The
      fitted fold gives a tailored effect, and the soft fold a semi-tailored
      effect. The
    drooping fold, usually seen on the midsummer hat made of transparent material,
    makes a soft, fluffy brim finish. The millinery fold and the single fold
    may be attached either to the brim or at the base of the crown.</p>
    <h3> <a name="fit" id="fit"></a>Fitted Fold</h3>
    <p> <em><strong><a href="illust/050.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,441);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/050-t.jpg" alt="Figure 50" width="150" height="179" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em>The fitted fold may have either a slip-stitch or a cord-edge finish.</p>
    <h6><strong><a name="fig50" id="fig50"></a>Figure 50. Slip-stitching fold to brim edge. <em>A</em>, long stitch
      running inside of folded edge of fold; <em>B</em>, needle catching top
      or facing covering with small stitch.</strong></h6>
    <p><strong> Fitted fold with slip-stitch finish.</strong> Cut a bias strip
      3 or 4 inches in width plus a quarter-inch seam allowance on each side.
      Proceed as when
      making a
    single-bias binding slip-stitched on both sides (<a href="mp-02-bind.html#fig4">Fig.
    4</a>).</p>
    <p> <strong>Fitted fold with cord-edge finish.</strong> The same method is
      followed as described above until the edges are to 
    be finished. These are turned over a wire, pinned, and sewed as for the cord-edge
    finish (<a href="mp-09-edge.html#fig38">Fig. 38</a>). The top wire is sewed in place first, with the stitches
    going through 
    to the facing side. The facing cord edge is finished with the stitches coming
    through the top of the brim, but hidden under the top wire.</p>
    <p> Extreme precaution must be taken not to stretch the edges of the fold
      either when fitting or replacing the fold on the brim. The stretching is
      done through
    the center of the fold (<a href="mp-02-bind.html#fig5">Fig. 5</a>).</p>
    <p><strong> Soft fold.</strong> Cut a bias strip 2&frac12; or 3 inches in
      width plus two seam allowances. Proceed as 
    in making the <a href="mp-02-bind.html#double">double-bias binding</a> 
    except that the edge of the soft fold is not slip-stitched to the brim covering
    but is left loose, standing
    slightly away from the brim.</p>
    <p> If this fold is used on a transparent hat, it should be placed between
    the top and the facing.</p>
    <h3> <a name="droop" id="droop"></a>Drooping Fold</h3>
    <p> This fold may be placed between the two brim coverings or on top of the
        finished brim, and finished with a decorative stitch or fold to cover
    the raw edges.</p>
    <p><strong> Fold placed between brim pieces. </strong>Cut, fit, and seam
      the bias strips as for the double-bias binding (<a href="mp-02-bind.html#fig7">Fig.
      7</a>). Be careful not
      to stretch the fold
        too
    tightly or it will &quot;cup&quot;; that is, turn back under the brim edge.
    The drooping edge should have a natural appearance, not a stiff, set line.<strong><em><a href="illust/051.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,589);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/051-t.jpg" alt="Figure 51" width="150" height="136" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em></strong>    Finish the brim facing
    first, turning the seam allowance and stitching it to the bias-crinoline
    edge covering (<a href="mp-04-brim.html#fig16">Fig. 16</a>). Place the fold on the top of the brim and sew it
    to the facing, with the stitches following 
    the same line as those holding the facing to the crinoline. Fit the top brim
    covering next, finishing it with the cord-edge finish (Fig. 51).</p>
    <h6><strong>Figure 51. Drooping with fold with edge of top covering used for final
    finish.</strong></h6>
    <p> For a transparent brim, fold the facing over the edge wire and attach
      it with small stitches which follow the wire. Place the fold, and sew to
    facing.</p>
    <h3 class="clear"> Fold with Decorative Finish</h3>
    <p> Place the fold over the finished covering of the brim top, turning the
        raw edges underneath. A decorative note may be added by using floss,
        yarns, or
    chenille when attaching the fold to the top of the brim, choosing the same
    or contrasting colors. Narrow trimming braid in straw makes a very desirable
    finish and is very easy to apply. Narrow folds form another decorative finish
    for the fold. The edges of the fold may be left raw, as the straw or applied
    folds will cover the unfinished edges.</p>
    <h3 class="clear"> <a name="mil" id="mil"></a><em><strong><a href="illust/052.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',222,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/052-t.jpg" alt="Figure 52" width="240" height="61" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em>Millinery Fold</h3>
    <p> The millinery fold is a double fold which varies greatly in width. If
      millinery folds are to be used in groups, they must be very narrow; if
      used singly,
    they may be wider. When cutting the bias strip, allow three times the width
    of the finished fold. If several strips are needed, sew them together, open
    the seams, and press. Fold down the top raw edge, right side out, to extend
    slightly past the center of the bias strip. Bring the lower edge up to 
    meet this. Fold the lower, finished edge upward, creasing where the two raw
    edges meet. This makes enough difference in the depth of the turning to show
    two folded edges on the right side instead of one (Fig. 52). The folds should
    be slip-stitched to hold the lower fold in place, or this second fold may
    be sewed by the machine slightly below its edge. The machine-stitching is
    done on very narrow folds in which the fabric is difficult to handle. The
    millinery fold may be used in place of ribbon at the base of the crown.</p>
    <h3 class="clear"> <a name="plain" id="plain"></a><em><strong><a href="illust/053.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',272,750);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/053-t.jpg" alt="Figure 53" width="220" height="69" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em>Plain Fold </h3>
    <p>Plan the number of bias strips needed, cut them twice 
      the finished width, and baste, sew, and press. Fold the raw edges so they
    meet at the center of the 
    bias strip. Catch the two raw edges together with the catch stitch (Fig.
    53). This fold may be slip-stitched to any surface.</p>
    <h6><strong>Figure 53. Wrong side of plain fold.</strong></h6>
    <h3 class="clear"> <a name="flan" id="flan"></a>Flanges</h3>
    <p> A flange is a strip of material, fitted or bias, which may be applied
      to any surface as a decoration or finish. It differs from a plain fitted
      fold
    in that it always has a finish at the edge of the brim. It may be used either
    on the top or on the facing, or on both.</p>
    <p> Flanges are made in two different ways: on the bias or fitted, depending
    upon the width of the flange. If the flange is not more than two inches wide
    it is advisable to use a bias strip, for the bias is less difficult to handle
    than the fitted strip. If the wide flange is to be cut, the fitted type should
    be used; for it is impossible to stretch a wide bias strip enough when fitting
    at the outer edge to pull out all fullness at the opposite side of the bias,
    and flanges must be smooth when finished.</p>
    <p><strong> <a name="biasfl" id="biasfl"></a>Bias flange.</strong> Cut a
      bias strip 2 inches wide plus a half-inch seam allowance on each side of
      the strip. Determine the number of bias
      strips needed and
    baste them together as for <a href="#fit">fitted folds</a>. Starting
    at the end of the longest strip, place one edge of the bias fold flush with
    the edge of the
    brim. Stretch the edge as tightly as possible without warping the brim, and
    pin it into place all around the edge of the brim. Establish the seam at
    the back. Remove the pins at the outer edge, being careful to mark the stretched
    edge so there will be no confusion when replacing the flange on the brim.
    Baste the end seams at the back to form a complete circle, sew all the seams
    by the machine, and 
    press open. Establish the point in the circle to be placed at the front of
    the brim (<a href="mp-23-seam.html#fig107">Fig. 107</a>) and stretch into place again with a quarter-inch seam
    allowance extending over the edge for the edge finish.</p>
    <p><strong> Finishing the edges of the flange.</strong> Both edges of the flange may be finished
    with the <a href="mp-09-edge.html#cordfin">cord-edge finish</a> or with the
    <a href="#fig50">slip-stitch finish</a>.</p>
    <p><strong> <em><a href="illust/054.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',469,671);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/054-t.jpg" alt="Figure 54" width="150" height="74" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig54" id="fig54"></a>Fitted flange.</strong> Place the pattern on the fabric, allowing
      a half-inch seam on each side of the flange for turning. 
    Fit the flange, and if a seam is necessary make the joining at the back.
    Pin the flange into place with the half-inch seam allowance extending over
    the edge of the brim. Fitted flanges may be finished by the same two processes
    as 
    those used for the bias flanges (Fig. 54). The lower edge of the fitted flange
    may need to be clipped slightly when turning the seam allowance over the
    wire or in slip-stitching.</p>
    <h6><strong>Figure 54. Fitted flange finished at outer and inner edges with cord-edge
      finish.</strong></h6>
    <p> Flanges are very decorative. They are used on felts or hard stiff hats
      where a touch of contrasting material or color is effective, also on combination
    silk and velvet, braid and silk, or georgette hats. Flanges may be used for
    decoration on crowns as well as on brims, or on plain crowns when a line
    is needed to decrease the appearance of height.</p>

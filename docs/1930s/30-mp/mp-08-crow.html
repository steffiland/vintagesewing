  <h2> CROWN COVERINGS</h2>
  <p> Sometimes too little attention is given to the crown of a hat, for in
      the crown lies the power to increase or decrease the height of the individual
    and the apparent width of the head and face. Therefore the fitting of the
    crown is a most important factor in making the hat more becoming (see <em><a href="mp-24-sele.html">Selection
    of Hats</a></em>).</p>
    <p><strong> Patterns. </strong>Directions for the making of the paper patterns
      for the different types of crowns described below may be found under <em><a href="mp-18-patt.html">Patterns</a></em>.</p>
    <h3> <a name="fit" id="fit"></a>Tailored, or Fitted, Crowns</h3>
    <p> Tailored, or fitted, crowns are used when a very smooth, or tailored,
      effect is wanted, as in the hat with a wide thin brim or in a sailor shape
      to be
    worn 
    with a tailored suit or coat. They are always made over a fabric foundation.</p>
    <p><strong> Construction.</strong><strong><a href="illust/023.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,353);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/023-t.jpg" alt="Figure 23" width="145" height="182" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong> Place<strong><a href="illust/022.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,506);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/022-t.jpg" alt="Figure 22" width="170" height="181" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong> the pattern of the crown top on
      the fabric so that the straight thread of the material runs from the center
      front to the center
    back, and cut the exact size of the paper pattern. Pin the material to the
    fabric crown at the front, back, and sides; distribute 
    the fullness evenly at the four bias corners, and pin securely all around.
    Catch down with the long-and-short stitch, the long stitch over the fabric.
    Establish a definite 
    line for this stitching, so that the finish at the top of the side crown
    is at an even distance, at all points, from the curve where the top of the
    crown slopes downward into the side crown (Fig. 22). After the fabric has
    been sewed in place, trim as close to the stitching line as possible to give
    a smooth finish.</p>
    <h6><strong><a name="fig22" id="fig22"></a>Figure 22. Tailored top, sewn in place, showing trimmed and untrimmed
    edges.</strong></h6>
    <h6><strong>Figure 23. Tailored, or fitted, side crown. Showing the wrong side of
      the fabric, with the back seam adjusted for stitching, and with the depth
      of the upper and lower side-crown seam turnings indicated.</strong></h6>
    <p class="clear"> Place the pattern of the side crown on the material, allowing for seams
      at the top, the bottom, and the back. Fit the fabric snugly around the
      crown,
    placing the seam directly in the back. Trim to the required seam width of
    &frac14; of an inch. Remove the fabric from the crown, turn the seam to the
    wrong side, and stitch on the machine. Press the seam open, slip the crown
    into
    place, right side out, and pin. If a cord-edge finish at the top is desired,
    follow the directions, for cord-edge finish (see <em><a href="mp-09-edge.html">Edge
     Finishes</a></em>). If the slip stitch is to be used, see the directions
    given on <a href="mp-09-edge.html#ssedge">page 51</a>, also <a href="mp-25-stit.html">page
    163</a>. In case the material used for the crown
    has a
    heavy nap, as in velvet, and cannot be pressed flat with the iron, follow
    the directions given under <em><a href="mp-18-patt.html">Pressing</a></em>.</p>
    <p><strong> Bottom finish of crown.</strong> The bottom of the crown is finished
      by turning the seam allowance over the edge of the crown and catching into
      place with
      the
    catch stitch, or by fastening the foundation crown to the brim 
    before the bottom finish is made and then turning a seam allowance and slip-stitching
    to the brim.</p>
    <h3> <a name="soft" id="soft"></a><strong><a href="illust/024.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,466);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/024-t.jpg" alt="Figure 24" width="170" height="204" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>Soft Crown with Oval or Round Top</h3>
    <h6><strong><a name="fig24" id="fig24"></a>Figure 24. Oval crown top with quarters marked.</strong></h6>
    <p> This crown may or may not be made over a fabric foundation. Keep in mind,
    when planning for a crown of this kind, that upon this oval or round top
    (called usually the <em>tip</em>) depends the type of the finished product,
     for there are a number of variations of this crown with the construction
    exactly similar but with the measurements of the crown <em>tip</em> differing.
    The depth of the ordinary crown is 9 inches from the top to the base, and
    it
    is easy to adjust the depth of the side crown to the size of the oval; in
    other words, when a small oval is used as the top, the side crown is necessarily
    deeper than 
    when a large oval is used. The side crown may be made on the bias or on the
    straight of the material.</p>
    <p class="clear"><strong> Crown tip. </strong>Place the pattern on the material, with the
      straight thread of the material running from front to back, and cut. The
      side crown is
      usually
    made of bias material. Find the exact head size (see <em><a href="mp-16-meas.html">Measurements</a></em>).
    Determine the depth of the side crown and cut the bias from the material.
    The bias must fit snugly round the bottom of the crown, for extra fullness
    at this point is difficult to dispose of neatly. Fit and establish the back
    seam. Sew by machine and press the seam open. As the seam in the bias strip
    runs diagonally, the placing of this seam in adjusting the 
    crown is important. The center of the seam must come directly at the back
    of the crown, one half of the seam on each side of the center (Fig. 25).<strong><a href="illust/025.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',498,620);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/025-t.jpg" alt="Figure 25" width="170" height="113" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>    Mark
    the center front, the center back, and each side of the bias side crown.
    Run a shirr thread around the top of the crown. Place the right sides of
    the crown and the oval together, with the markings joining. Draw the shirr
    thread into 
    place so that the fullness may be distributed evenly. Baste, and sew by machine,
    removing the basting and turning to the right side in completing. If a narrow
    top to the crown is desired, the oval must be small, making the bias side
     deep enough to bring up over the curve of the crown to meet the oval. If
    the crown is to have soft folds, extra depth must be allowed for the folds,
    according to the amount of softness wanted. The crown oval may be increased
    or decreased to suit the type of individual. </p>
    <h6><strong><a name="fig25" id="fig25"></a>Figure 25. Bias side crown marked at quarters with center of bias seam
      at center back of crown.</strong></h6>
    <p class="clear">Although it does not give the
    same degree of softness, a straight side crown may be made when small straight
    pieces are to be utilized. If a straight side crown is desired, measure for
    the depth and head size of the crown plus a seam allowance at both sides
    and at each end of the strip. This crown will have an upright seam which
    comes directly at the back of the crown. Mark, baste, and sew the side crown
    to the crown oval in the same manner as in the bias side crown. Turn the
    seam 
    allowance at the bottom of the crown and attach to the brim with the slip
    stitch.</p>
    <p> If this crown is to be made over a fabric foundation, attach the crown
      to the brim, slip the soft crown over the fabric crown, turn the seam allowance
    into place at the bottom of the crown, and slip-stitch to the brim (<a href="mp-12-fold.html#fig50">Fig.
    50</a>); if the crown is to have a very soft effect, it is attached to the brim
    by the same method, letting the soft hat lining serve as the only foundation.</p>
    <h3 class="clear"> <a name="shir" id="shir"></a><strong><a href="illust/026.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',537,620);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/026-t.jpg" alt="Figure 26" width="140" height="121" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>Shirred Crowns</h3>
    <p> Shirred crowns are made either from a bias or a straight strip of material.
    They are especially attractive for 
    children's hats, although they may be used on hats for adults also.</p>
    <p> <strong>Construction.</strong> The shirred crowns always are made over
      a foundation crown. Measure the depth of the crown from the top to the
      base, allowing &frac12; of
    an inch at each side of the 
    strip for the finish at both the top and the base of the crown. The strips
    are the length of the circumference of the base of the crown plus from &frac14;
    to &frac12; of the length for the shirring. The distance between the shirr threads
    is usually from &frac12; of an inch to &frac34; of an inch. On the wrong side of the
    material indicate with tailor's chalk where the lines of shirring are to
    go. Join the strips in a circle before running the shirr shreads. The shirring
    may be done either by hand or by machine. 
    Starting at the center back of the strip, secure the thread with a firm knot
    but do not back-stitch, for the thread is to be pulled up. Follow each line
    of marking until all the shirrings are completed. For the top joining turn
    the crown to the wrong side and pull the top shirr thread to a measurement
    of 5 inches in length. Divide this opening in half and sew in a seam the
    length of which runs from the front to the back of the top of the crown (Fig.
    26). This type of joining avoids an appearance of bulk; and, by giving the
    length to the top joining, the shirrings have a perfect line as they follow
    down the side crown. Pull up the threads, slip the crown over the foundation,
    and distribute the gathers evenly. The thread ends should be pulled through
    the foundation crown and fastened. Turn the seam allowance at the base of
    the crown for the finish. Cut a slash at the top of the fabric crown and
    slip the top seam into the opening.</p>
    <h3> <a name="bias" id="bias"></a>Bias-strip Crown</h3>
    <p> Bias-strip crowns are usually made over a foundation crown, although
    they may be fashioned without the foundation.</p>
    <p> If a foundation crown is used, the folds are prepared as for the <a href="mp-04-brim.html#bfold">bias-fold
    brim</a>. Start the folds 2 inches to the right of the center back
    of the base of the crown, with &frac14; of an inch extending beyond the base
    of the crown for final finish when attaching to the brim. Lap, and start
    spiral
    at back, winding the fold around the crown, lapping and sewing as for the
    brim folds (<a href="mp-04-brim.html#fig17">Fig. 17</a>). As the curve of the top of the crown is reached, a
    slight fullness will be found at the raw edge of the fold. Distribute this
      fullness evenly and hold in place under the long stitch. When the top of
      the crown is reached, cut a lengthwise slash in the foundation
    crown and run the end of the fold through this slash; this makes a neat finish.
    If a tailored effect is desired, the outer edge of the fold may be sewed
    to the crown with long and short stitches, the short stitch showing on the
    right side. The same color of thread or a contrasting thread may be used
    for this stitching.</p>
    <p> If bias folds are to be used for a soft crown, it is best to pin the
      folds into place over a crown block or a stiff fabric crown. Remove, and
      sew as
    in the process preceding.</p>
    <h3> <a name="sec" id="sec"></a>Sectional Crowns. (See <em><a href="mp-18-patt.html">Patterns</a></em>)</h3>
    <p> Sectional crowns have many interesting variations, and often are spoken
        of as jockey, or melon, crowns. 
      They may be put together with a plain or a corded seam. The number of
        sections used depends upon the preference of the individual, although
        the popular
    choice ranges from four to six. These sections may be so joined that they
    come to a point at the top of the crown; or they may be cut to carry the
    sections over the head, with seams running from side to side. The former
    gives the effect of increased height; and the latter, of increased width.</p>
    <h3 class="clear"> <a name="up" id="up"></a>Construction of an Upright Sectional Crown</h3>
    <p> Unfold the<strong><a href="illust/027.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,356);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/027-t.jpg" alt="Figure 27" width="140" height="218" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong> pattern, <strong><a href="illust/028.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',333,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/028-t.jpg" alt="Figure 28" width="220" height="86" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>place on the fabric, with the straight thread of
      the material running lengthwise through the sections from the tip to the
      base
    of the crown, and cut. If <em>four</em> sections are used, baste the sections
    together to form two halves (Fig. 27). Next baste the two halves together,
    with the
    continuous seam running from the front to the back and with points meeting
    accurately at the top. Fit on the head and adjust if 
    necessary at this point of construction. Sew by machine and do not iron the
    seams. If <em>five</em> sections are used, the sections should be basted together,
    one after the other, and fitted for seam adjustment (Fig. 28). If <em>six</em> sections
    are used, baste together in groups of three; the two groups of three sections
    are then joined as in the four-section crown. Fit to the head and adjust
    seams.</p>
    <h6><strong>Figure 27. Four sectional-crown sections in position for joining.</strong></h6>
    <h6><strong>Figure 28. Five sectional-crown sections in position for seaming.</strong></h6>
    <h3 class="clear"> <a name="cord" id="cord"></a>Sectional Crowns with Corded Seams</h3>
    <p> If <em>four</em> sections are used, proceed with the basting and fitting
      as for the four-section plain-seam crown (Fig. 27). The fitting must be
      done
        carefully;
    for after the cords are placed, it is a difficult task to make changes. When
    the crown has been fitted accurately, run a basting 
    thread along the fitted seam line before taking it apart. This line is then
    followed in the placing of the cord. Rip the crown and insert the cording
    between the seams (<a href="mp-07-cord.html#fig20">Fig. 20</a>). In
    placing the cord between the seams either of two arrangements may be followed:</p>
    <p> <strong><a href="illust/029.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,527);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/029-t.jpg" alt="Figure 29" width="140" height="130" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>1. Start cording at the base of one of the sections, with the raw edge
      of the bias corded strip to the raw edge of 
    the section and the right sides placed together. Baste section and cord together,
    following the basting line, and cut the cord at the top, or point, of the
    section (Fig. 29, A). Baste a second section to the one already corded to
    complete one half of the crown. Repeat the process when cording and joining
    the remaining two 
    sections. Place a final cord, running from the base of the crown at the center
    front to the base of the crown at the center back; baste the cord to half
    of the crown; and join the second half to the corded half. This will give
    an unbroken cord line running directly over the top of the crown from front
    to back. Sew by hand with small running stitches.</p>
    <p> <a name="fig29" id="fig29"></a>2. <strong><a href="illust/031.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,433);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/031-t.jpg" alt="Figure 31" width="170" height="218" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>Cord <strong><a href="illust/030.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,456);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/030-t.jpg" alt="Figure 30" width="140" height="173" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>entirely around two sections (Fig. 29, B; also Fig. 30), join
      the remaining two sections to the two corded sections, and sew with the
      small
    running stitch. 
    If <em>five</em> sections are used, place the cord on one side of every section, the
    cord being cut at the point of the crown. The sections are then joined together,
    one after the other, until the crown is completed. Sew by hand with the small
    running stitch.</p>
    <h6><strong>Figure 29. Corded upright sectional-crown sections. <em>A</em>, cording
      joined to one side of section and cut at top; <em>B</em>, cording carried
      from base of crown on right side to base of crown on left side.</strong></h6>
    <h6><strong>Figure 30. Four-sectional crown with cording running entirely around
    two sections.</strong></h6>
    <h6><strong>Figure 31. One section of sectional crown, showing separate pieces used
    to make definite design.</strong></h6>
    <p class="clear"> A <em>six</em>-section crown may be corded by either of the processes
      used for the four-section crown, the only difference being that the 
    half crown will consist of three sections instead of two.</p>
    <p> These sections may be cut and joined in many ways, 
      using the same or contrasting material. This must be 
      done, however, as the sections are being planned, each section being completed
    before joining it to the others. It is necessary that the points at the top
    of the crown join accurately, as the lines of the crown radiate from this
    point, and it is the most conspicuous part of the crown. A seam placed at
    the front of the crown gives the most becoming line; if a section is 
    placed at the front of the crown a flattened effect is given to the face
    of the wearer.</p>
    <p> Where cords have been cut and collected at the top of the crown, and
      the finished sectional crown is to be placed over a fabric foundation,
      a slash
    may be made at the top of the foundation crown and the cords pulled through.</p>
    <h3> <a name="side" id="side"></a><strong><a href="illust/032.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',619,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/032-t.jpg" alt="Figure 32" width="140" height="136" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>Sectional Crowns with Sections running from Side to Side</h3>
    <p> This type of sectional crown suggests weight or width much more than
      does the upright sectional crown, and must be planned with this fact definitely
    in mind.</p>
    <p><strong> Construction.</strong> After the material has been cut exactly by the pattern,
      the two crescent-shaped pieces are joined at the greater curve to the long
      center
    strip, one on each side, and the two half circles forming the front and the
    back of the crown are joined to the smaller curve of the crescent.</p>
    <p> Before joining, find the center of each piece and mark it. Place the
      pieces so that the markings stand opposite each other, basting each way
      from the
    center point rather than from end to end. This is done so that any fullness
    along the curved edges may be distributed evenly and so that the base of
    the crown strips may meet accurately. This crown may be finished with cording
    as in the other sectional corded crowns.</p>
    <h3 class="clear"> <a name="oval" id="oval"></a>Side Crown with Scalloped Edge and Oval Top</h3>
    <p> <strong>Construction. </strong>Place the pattern on the fabric and cut.
      If felt is used for the side crown, the edges are left raw; 
      if velvet or silk, the edges must be turned as for a casing. Stitch around
    the scallops two or three times, not only for decoration but so that the
    stitching will draw in the edges slightly, causing the scallops to conform
    to the curve of the top of the head (<a href="mp-18-patt.html#fig96">Fig.
    96</a>). Finish the back
    seam of the crown and mark the quarters. Place the crown over the oval to
    the depths of 
    the slashes and pin the scallops in place, the fullness being taken out under
    the scallops and not at the slash point. A hat block is a great convenience
    in adjusting a crown of this type, for the crown may be slipped over the
    block and the scallops pinned. Baste and sew by hand, following one of the
    lines of machine-stitching.</p>
    <p> Part-sectional crowns are very effective. They may be made with the sectional
    top entirely separate from the plain side crown or with the sectional top
    and the side crown in one piece.</p>

    <p> <strong>Construction. </strong>Place the pattern on the fabric with the front on the straight

    Follow the processes given for the varying number of sections, the only difference
    in point of construction being that the combination crown is joined with
    an upright seam directly at the back (Fig. 33).</p>

      showing continuous seam line from front to back of crown top.</strong></h6>
    <h3 class="clear"> <a name="top" id="top"></a>Side Crown and Sectional Top Separate</h3>
    <p> <strong>Construction.</strong> For the top use the separate sectional-top
      pattern. Baste the pieces for the top of the crown together and sew as
      in the making
        of the
    sectional crown of the same number of pieces. The average crown is 9 inches
    in depth from top to base. Measure one half of the crown top and subtract
    this number of inches from 9. This will give the depth of the side crown
    minus the two seam allowances for finishing. Cut a bias strip for the side
    crown and fit, join, and seam at the back as for a plain bias crown (<a href="#fig25">Fig.
    25</a>). Measure the halves and quarters of the crown top and side
    crown; place the right sides together, baste, and sew.</p>
    <h3> <a name="tam" id="tam"></a>Tams. (See <em><a href="mp-18-patt.html">Patterns</a></em>)</h3>
    <p> The tam is much in favor with the younger girl, being soft and comfortable
    and usually made of material that will stand rough treatment and will not
    soil. The tam 
    may match a coat or scarf, completing a costume, or be worn for sport wear.
    It may be made in one piece or cut in sections.</p>
    <h3 class="clear"> <a name="onepiece" id="onepiece"></a><strong><a href="illust/034.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,493);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/034-t.jpg" alt="Figure 34" width="140" height="171" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>One-piece Tam</h3>
    <p> <strong>Construction.</strong> Place the pattern on the fabric and cut,
      marking the halves and quarters of the circle. Run 
    two shirr threads &frac14; of an inch apart around the outside of the circle
    and draw up the threads (Fig. 34). Measure for the exact head size (see <em><a href="mp-16-meas.html">Measurements</a></em>);
    cut a strip of the same material 3 or 4 inches wide and of the head-size
    length plus a half-inch seam allowance at each end. Seam at the back and
    open the seam, folding the strip in the center lengthwise. Baste along 
    the lengthwise fold to insure even division of the band. Fold the band in
    quarters and mark (Fig. 35, A). The band and the circle may be joined in
    two ways:</p>
    <p> 1. Turn the seam allowance at the edge of the headband and baste. Place
      the markings together, letting the outside half of the headband extend
      up over
    the fullness. Baste into place and stitch by machine. The under half of the
    head-size band is then brought up into place over the raw edge and slip-stitched.
    This gives an upright appearance to the fullness.</p>
    <p class="clear"> <strong><a href="illust/035.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,792);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/035-t.jpg" alt="Figure 35" width="140" height="139" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>2. Place the markings of headband and circle together, with the right
      side of the circle to the right side of the headband. Distribute the gathers
      evenly
    and sew the 
    two pieces together with a plain seam. Turn the facing of the headband into
    place, extending it over the seam, then turn the seam allowance on the headband,
    and slip-stitch. This method gives the crown a more pronounced droop. If
    very soft material is used, a light-weight stiffening may be placed under
    the fabric. If the material is not wide enough to complete the circle, the
    piecings should come on each side.</p>
    <h6><strong>Figure 35. Two-piece circular tam. <em>A,</em> headband; <em>B</em>,
      facing, showing the shifting of the head-size oval to the left to give
      more droop to the right side of the tam.</strong></h6>
    <h3 class="clear"> <a name="twopiece" id="twopiece"></a><a name="two" id="two"></a>Two-piece Circular Tam</h3>
    <p> <strong>Construction.</strong> Place paper circles on the fabric and
      cut. Measure for head size (see <em><a href="mp-16-meas.html">Measurements</a></em>)
      and cut the head-size oval from the center of one of the circles (Fig.
      35, <em>B</em>). If a cording is to be used at
    the edge of the circle to add a decorative note, cover the cord with a bias
    strip
    of the material and, starting at the center back, sew to the top circle first,
    using the method for attaching the cord to the sectional-crown strips (<a href="#fig29">Fig.
    29</a>). Join the two circles together, with the cord showing at the edge.</p>
    <p> For a headband cut a strip 3 inches wide plus half an inch at each end
      for a seam (Fig. 35, A). Sew by machine and open the seam. Fold the headband
    in halves along the lengthwise fold and run a basting along this fold. Mark
    the halves and quarters of the head-size oval and head-size band and place
    the markings opposite each other. Attach by either of the processes described
    for the one-piece tam.</p>
    <p> The headbands may be made of ribbon or of contrasting material; stiffening
    may be used if desired. If the tam circle is brought down to the base of
    the headband, a narrow band of crinoline or flexible net may be placed
     on the inside of the band to hold the head size in place. If no head-size
    band is used, the head size of the tam may be bound with a bias or a straight
    binding of the same material. This gives a neat, tailored finish.</p>
    <p> The placing of the head-size oval may be shifted to the left or the right
    side of the under circle to give the tam a decided droop on either side without
    pulling it out of place.</p>
    <h3> <a name="beret" id="beret"></a>Beret Tam</h3>
    <p> Beret tams are made of two flat circles like those used for circular
      tams, but smaller and close-fitting. Usually they are made of heavy material,
      and
    are not sewed to a head-size band but are bound with narrow straight binding.</p>
    <p><strong> Construction.</strong> Place the pattern on the fabric and cut. Next cut the head
    size from the center of one circle. Sew the two circles together at the outside
    edge, the right sides together. Bind the head size.</p>
    <h3> <a name="fitted" id="fitted"></a><strong><a href="illust/036.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',502,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/036-t.jpg" alt="Figure 36" width="166" height="94" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong><a name="fig36" id="fig36"></a>Tam with Circular Top and Fitted Under Crown</h3>
    <p> <strong>Construction.</strong> Place the pattern on the fabric and cut.
      Join the fitted side-crown strip by machine and open the 
      seam. Join the side crown to the circular top with a plain seam or with
        cording. Follow the same process for the headband as for <a href="#two">two-piece
    circular tams</a>.</p>
    <h3 class="clear"> <a name="fitunder" id="fitunder"></a><strong><a href="illust/037.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,730);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/037-t.jpg" alt="Figure 37" width="170" height="136" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>Tam with Fitted Under Crown in Two Parts</h3>
    <p> <strong>Construction.</strong> The pattern is placed on the fabric, and
      the material cut accordingly, for allowance has already been made for the
      seams (Fig.
        37). The under-crown
    seams are placed on each side of the crown. Sew by machine, press, and attach
    to the top circle and the head-size band as for the two-piece circular tam.</p>
    <h3 class="clear"> <a name="six" id="six"></a>Six-section Flared Tam</h3>
    <p> <strong>Construction. </strong>This attractive tam may be made in six
      sections, which flare to give the customary wide flat line to the crown.
      Place the pattern
      for
    the sections on the fabric, as for the plain sectional crown, and cut; use
    a plain or corded seam finish (<a href="mp-07-cord.html#fig20">Fig. 20</a>). Bind the 
    head size with a straight or bias strip of the same material. Care should
    be taken not to stretch the head size when attaching the binding.</p>
    <p> These sections may be enlarged or decreased; but if the head size is
      enlarged or decreased, then the proportion of the sections must be increased
      or decreased
    accordingly. The sections may also be placed on the bias of the material
    and cut. This gives added softness to the tam. They may be made with or without
    a lining, depending entirely upon the fabric used.</p>

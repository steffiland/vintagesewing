  <h2> BINDINGS</h2>
  <p> Bindings are frequently applied to the finished brim for decorative purposes,
    but in a renovation problem they may be used to cover a worn or unattractive
    edge. They are also used for covering the wire at the edge of the frame.
    Usually these bindings are made on the bias 
    of the material, but a binding of ribbon with finished edges is used on the
  straight. There are several different methods of applying bindings.</p>
  <h3> <a name="sb" id="sb"></a>Single-bias Binding for Covering the Wire on Fabric Frames</h3>
  <p> Cut 1-inch bias strips from common crinoline, flexible
    crinoline, or chiffonette. The number of strips needed may be determined
    by measuring around the brim.
    Do not sew together, for all frame materials are lapped flat 
    the width of a seam when adjusted to the frame. Crease the strip through
    the center lengthwise and adjust so that one half is on each side of the
    wired brim edge. Use even stab stitches about half an inch in length. These
    stitches should be placed as near as possible to the raw edge of the binding
    and not under the wire (Fig. 3). This insures a firm fastening which will
    not curl at the edges. As the binding is sewed in place, hold the bias snug
  to eliminate any fullness.</p>
  <p> <strong><a href="illust/003.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',344,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/003-t.jpg" alt="Figure 3" width="240" height="72" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>This kind of binding protects the outside covering from the wire and from
    the harsh frame material; it also forms a foundation for the edge stitches
  of the covering on the top of the brim.</p>
  <h6><strong><a name="fig3" id="fig3"></a>Figure 3. Single-bias binding; edge wire attached with lock stitch. Right
    of figure, wired edge of brim and lock stitch used in attaching the wire.

  <h3 class="clear"> <a name="both" id="both"></a>Single-bias <strong><a href="illust/005.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,778);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/005-t.jpg" alt="Figure 5" width="170" height="126" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>Binding <strong><a href="illust/004.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',523,688);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/004-t.jpg" alt="Figure 4" width="170" height="83" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>slip-stitched at Both Sides</h3>
  <h6><strong><a name="fig4" id="fig4"></a>Figure 4. Single-bias binding slip-stitched on both sides, with diagonal
    seam at center back of brim.</strong></h6>
  <h6><strong><a name="fig5" id="fig5"></a>Figure 5. Section of single-bias binding, or fitted fold, stretched on
    edge of brim.</strong></h6>
  <p> The bias strip to be cut for this binding is usually from 1 inch to 1&frac12;
    inches in width, but it must always be twice the desired width when finished,
    plus two seam allowances. Measure around the brim for the number of pieces
     required. If two or more pieces are to be used, baste or sew them to each
    other but do not join them all together to make a complete circle. Make sure
    that all the seams run in the same direction. The binding must then be fitted
    to the 
    brim. To do this, pin the bias to the brim at the center back and, pulling
    gently lengthwise through the center of the strip, draw the strip entirely
    around the brim. This should result in a snug, smooth-fitted binding. Allow
     enough for a final seam, remove from the brim, and join the two ends to
    complete
    the circle (for correct placing, see <em><a href="mp-23-seam.html">Seams</a></em>).
    Determine the point to be placed at the front of the brim and gently work
    the binding over
    
    the edge and into place again, with the binding showing equally on top and
    facing; then turn in the seam allowance on each side and slip-stitch the
  fold to the brim covering (see <em><a href="mp-12-fold.html">Folds</a></em>,
   and <em><a href="mp-26-stra.html">Stitches</a></em>).</p>
  <h3 class="clear"> <a name="one" id="one"></a>Single-bias Binding slip-stitched on One Side</h3>
  <h6><strong>Figure 6. Single-bias binding slip-stitched on one side, showing long-and-short
    stitch used in attaching binding to brim edge. Seams placed elsewhere than
    at center back when more than one piece has been used for binding.</strong></h6>
  <p> <strong><a href="illust/006.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',507,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/006-t.jpg" alt="Figure 6" width="170" height="121" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>This binding is the same as Fig. 4 except that one side of the bias strip
    is first attached to the hat (Fig. 6) and the loose side is slip-stitched
    into place. After the binding has been fitted and joined in a circle, place
    one raw edge even with the outside circle of the top of the brim, and pin.
    Attach with .the long-and-short stitch, going 
    through to the facing side with every stitch. The distance between the stitch
    and the edge of the brim determines the depth of the binding when finished.
    The long stitch follows the fold; the short stitch is on the facing side.
    Fold the remaining half over the edge, turn in the seam allowance, and slip-stitch
  into place.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"> <a name="double" id="double"></a>Double-bias Binding</h3>
  <h6><strong><a name="fig7" id="fig7"></a>Figure 7.Double-bias binding attached with long-and-short stitch. Wrong
    side of binding folded inside.</strong></h6>
  <p> <strong><a href="illust/007.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',384,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/007-t.jpg" alt="Figure 7" width="205" height="100" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>As soft material lends itself to the double-bias binding more readily than
    heavier material, soft silks, satins, georgettes, or crepes are generally
    used. Allow four times 
    the finished width of the fold plus two seam allowances, and in fitting proceed
    as in single binding. After the binding has been fitted and seamed, double
    it by placing the raw edges together; be careful to avoid a pulled bias.
     Baste the raw edges together with long loose stitches, place them at the
    outside brim line, either on the facing or on the top, and pin in place (Fig.
    7). Sew as in single binding and turn the folded edge over the brim, slip-stitching
  it to the top or to the facing covering.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"> <a name="rib" id="rib"></a>Ribbon Binding</h3>
  <h6><strong>Figure 8. Straight binding with upright joining at back.</strong></h6>
  <p> <strong><a href="illust/008.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',364,670);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/008-t.jpg" alt="Figure 8" width="200" height="70" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>Narrow grosgrain, velvet, or taffeta ribbon is preferred for the straight
    binding. Place the ribbon over the edge of the brim at the center back, with
    an equal amount of 
    ribbon on each side of the brim, and baste in place. If the hat is a soft
    one the machine may be used to stitch the ribbon to the brim, but care must
    be taken to see that the stitching 
    follows the cord finish at the edge of the ribbon (Fig. 8); if the hat is
    stiff and the binding is to be stitched by hand, small slanting stitches
  are used to sew the ribbon in place.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"> <a name="shir" id="shir"></a>Shirred Binding</h3>
  <h6><strong>Figure 9. Shirred binding attached to brim with cord-edge finish. Center
    of bias seam placed at the center of the back, when the binding has required
    one strip only.</strong></h6>
  <p> <strong><a href="illust/009.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,470);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/009-t.jpg" alt="Figure 9" width="170" height="145" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>Shirred bindings may be used to extend the brim of a hat or to add a soft,
    decorative note. However, they add weight as well as softness, a fact which
  should be considered in making a selection.</p>
  <p> These bindings may be made either on the straight or on the bias of the
    material, and their width should 
    depend on the purpose for which they are intended. For bias shirred bindings
    a strip from 2 to 4 inches usually is chosen. Cut a true bias as for a fitted
    fold; but because of the fullness required, allow from one quarter to one
    half more than the circumference of the brim, according to the weight of
    the material. After the pieces are cut and joined in a circle, with seams
    pressed, 
    determine the center front and center back (for correct seam-placing, see
    <em><a href="mp-23-seam.html">Seams</a></em>). Beginning at the center back,
    make a casing just wide enough for a small frame wire or a lace wire (see <em><a href="mp-05-casi.html">Casings</a></em>).
    In making the casing use a running stitch with a single thread to match the
    material;
    draw up
    the thread snug when the binding is adjusted to the brim. The seams in the
    casing must all run in the same direction or the wire will not slip through
    easily. Cut two equal strips of wire, their length determined by the distance
    round the brim at the point where the binding is to be attached, plus a lapping
    of 
    from &frac14; to &frac12; inch. Turn the end of each piece of wire &frac14; of
    an inch back upon itself to provide a rounded edge, and run the wire into
    the casing.
    Fit the binding over the brim edge so that the wires stand opposite each
    other, one on the top and the other on the facing. Distribute the gathers
    evenly around the brim and pin the wires into place. The top wired edge is
    sewed into place first with the cord-edge stitch (see <em><a href="mp-09-edge.html">Edge
    Finishes</a></em>), the stitch going through to the facing side of the brim.
    The sewing of the
    facing wire follows, the stitch also going through the brim, with the needle
    coming out between the wired edge of the fold and the top covering of the
  brim, so that the stitch is hidden under the top wire.</p>
  <p> In placing the binding for extending a brim, decide upon the exact amount
    required for the extension. To insure an even extension, place a row of pins
    at even distances around the lengthwise fold of the binding. Slip the binding
    over the brim. The pins formaline around the outside of the hat and hold
  the extended fullness in place.</p>
  <p><strong> For shirred binding </strong>on the straight of the material cut
    the fabric into strips from 2&frac12; to 3 inches wide plus two seam allowances.
    Determine the amount
    of fullness desired, as for the bias binding. When straight material is used,
    more fullness may be allowed than with bias, as the gathers may be pulled
    into place more snugly. Join the strips in a circle and turn the casing (see
    <em><a href="mp-05-casi.html">Casings</a></em>). In making the casings
    the same process and stitch are used as for bias shirred binding.</p>
  <p><strong> For shirred-ribbon binding</strong> the process just described is followed except
    that it is not necessary to turn a casing, since the ribbon has a finished
  edge. The shirr thread runs just above this edge.</p>

  <h2> <strong><em><a href="illust/131.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,280);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/131-t.jpg" alt="Figure 131" width="109" height="205" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em></strong>STITCHES USED IN MILLINERY</h2>
    <p> The stitches used in millinery are practically the same as those used
      in garment-making, except that many of them are made much longer in order
      to
    avoid any suggestion of the &quot;sewed&quot; look when the hat is completed.
    However, in all seams sewed by hand and in the running of all shirr threads
    small
    stitches must be used. The machine should be used for all seaming whenever
possible.</p>
    <h6><strong><a name="fig131" id="fig131"></a>Figure 131. Stitches. <em>A</em>, long-and-short stitch; <em>B</em>,
      long stitch with short back stitch; <em>C</em>, even stab stitch&#8212;from
      right side of material; <em>C1, </em>even stab stitch&#8212;from wrong
      side of material; <em>D</em>, running stitch; <em>E</em>, catch stitch.</strong></h6>
    <p class="clear"><strong> <a name="slip" id="slip"></a>The slip stitch</strong> is one
      of the most difficult stitches to make neatly, and yet no other stitch
      is used more often in millinery.
      It is used in
      the making
      of bindings, folds, and edge finishes. As practically all slip-stitching
      is done on circular edges, the method used in hat construction is slightly
      different from that used in garment-making. The point of the needle is
      inserted inside the turned 
      edge of the fold and slipped along for half an inch. Then it is brought
      out just back of the under edge of the fold. A small catching stitch is
      placed
      on the opposite side a short distance ahead of the point where the needle
      comes through the fold. Placing the stitch in this way permits any slight
      fullness to be pulled in, A space 1/8 of an inch 
      in length is left before inserting the needle again into the fold (<a href="mp-12-fold.html#fig50">Fig.
  50</a>).</p>
    <p> <strong><a name="long" id="long"></a>The long-and-short stitch</strong> is of great service in many places, and especially
        so where material must be firmly attached without having a stiff look.
        The long part of the stitch holds the fabric in place, with the short
      part of
    the stitch on the opposite side (Fig. 131, <em>A</em>).</p>
    <p> <strong><a name="cord" id="cord"></a>The cord-edge</strong> stitch is a small long-and-short stitch used for the cord-edge
      finish (see <em><a href="mp-09-edge.html">Edge Finishes</a></em>).</p>
    <p> <strong><a name="run" id="run"></a>The running stitch</strong> is used for all shirring and seaming. It is a series
            of fine even stitches; when used for shirring, the thread must be
      continuous (Fig. 131, <em>D</em>).</p>
    <p> <strong><a name="back" id="back"></a>The back stitch</strong> is made by a long stitch and a very short stitch
              which doubles back on the long stitch for a few threads. This stitch
              should
              be used in
              combination with the <em>running stitch</em> when sewing seams by hand,
      taking one back stitch to every third running stitch (Fig. 131, <em>B</em>).</p>
    <p> <strong><a name="lock" id="lock"></a>The lock stitch</strong> is used
      for fastening the wire to the frame. It holds the wire so securely that
      there is no danger of its' slipping
                from
                the fabric
                surface. First attach the wire to the frame by two or three small
                stitches which pass over the wire and through the frame. Then
      insert the needle
                from the under side through the frame fabric close to the wire.
                This brings the
                needle and thread to the top of the brim edge. With the thumb
      of the left hand hold the thread parallel to the wire and insert the
                needle
                again from
                the under side. As the needle is brought out, the lock in the
      stitch will be formed. The stitches should be &frac34; of an inch in length
                (<a href="mp-02-bind.html#fig3">Fig. 3</a>).</p>
    <p> <strong><a name="cat" id="cat"></a>The catch stitch</strong> is used only where the edges are turned
      down upon a flat surface, as at the edge of a fold 
      or binding or where two raw edges are to be loosely caught
                  together. The stitch is caught first into the turned edge and
                  then, with
                  a long slanting
                  stitch, caught to the other surface. This holds the raw edge
                  of the fold in place without attaching it to the brim (Fig.
                  131, <em>E</em>).</p>
    <p> <strong><a name="tie" id="tie"></a>The tie tack</strong> is employed when securing crown folds or trimmings
                    to the crown. The needle is inserted from the inside of the
                    crown, the
                    thread
                    is pulled
                    through, a small catch is taken in the fold, and the needle
                    is taken back to the inside of the crown; the two free ends
                    of the
                    thread
                    are then tied
                    in a square knot. The thread is thus left slightly slack,
      which gives a loose, graceful appearance, whereas sewing would have
                    given a tight,
                    set
                    look.</p>
    <p> <strong><a name="stab" id="stab"></a>The stab stitch</strong> may be made of even or uneven length. Each
                      stitch is made separately by thrusting the needle in and
                      out through
                      any surface
                      (Fig.
                      131,<em> C</em>).</p>
    <p class="clear"> <strong><a name="mach" id="mach"></a><em><a href="illust/133.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',347,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/133-t.jpg" alt="Figure 133" width="200" height="82" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Machine<em><a href="illust/132.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',296,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/132-t.jpg" alt="Figure 132" width="200" height="69" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em> stitching</strong> may
      be used to obtain many interesting spacing effects or designs. It is done
      with 
      heavy silk thread in the same or in contrasting colors
                        or with silver or gold thread. The heavy silk metallic
                        thread
                        should
                        be threaded
                        on the bobbin,
                        and the stitching done from the wrong side. This decorative
                        stitching is most frequently used on side crowns (Figs.
                        132-133). </p>
    <h6><strong>Figure 132. Straight stitching used on side crown.</strong></h6>
    <h6><strong>Figure 133. Diagonal stitching used on side crown.</strong></h6>
    <p class="clear"><strong>Stitched
                          side crowns.</strong>      Cut a strip of light-weight white paper the exact width
                          and length of the side crown. On 
        this draw the lines, or design, to be used, being careful
                          to match the design at the back seam-joining. Baste
      the strip of paper on
                          the wrong
                          side of the
                          side crown, with the design to the outside. Place under
                          the machine foot and stitch, following the design.
      Remove from
                          the machine
                          and tear the
                          paper from the side crown.</p>
    <p> <strong><a name="qui" id="qui"></a>Quilting</strong> follows closely the process used for plain
                            machine-stitching except that a padding is placed
      between the paper and
                            the fabric for the side
                            crown. This gives the puffy appearance as of depth.</p>
    <p> <strong>Quilted side crowns.</strong> On white paper sketch the design
                              to be used. Then place a piece of sheet wadding
      between the
                              marked
                              paper
                              and the wrong
                              side of the
                              fabric of the side crown; baste the three pieces
                              together carefully to avoid any slipping. Place
      under the machine
                              foot and follow
                              the directions
                              given
                              above for plain stitching.</p>
    <p> The same process may be used on the crown tip.
                                Choose a small motif from the design and repeat
                                it on the
                                crown tip. The
                                design on the
                                crown tip
                                and on the side crown may be matched so perfectly
                                that the stitching will have
                                the appearance of a continuous line.</p>
    <p> <strong><a name="tuck" id="tuck"></a>Tucking</strong> is another form of decoration often used
                                  for side crowns. The tucks may be arranged
      in groups or
                                  at regular
                                  distances.</p>
    <p class="clear"> <strong><em><a href="illust/134.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',520,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/134-t.jpg" alt="Figure 134" width="200" height="125" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="tsc" id="tsc"></a>Tucked side crowns. </strong>The side crown is cut wide
                                    enough to allow for the tucks, which are
      put in after the
                                    back joining
                                    is made
                                    and pressed;
                                    this
                                    insures
                                    the perfect matching of the tucks at the
      back seam (Fig. 134). Narrow pin tucks are generally
                                    used
                                    to avoid any
                                    appearance 
      of clumsiness. The spaces are marked for
                                    the tucks, and they are stitched in by machine,
                                    using thread
                                    to match
                                    the fabric.</p>

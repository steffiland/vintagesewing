  <h2>MATERIALS FOR COVERING HATS  </h2>  
    <p> Many different types of material are used for the covering of hats. A
      few of these materials are of such weight and texture that they are carried
      over from one season to the following. Satins, silks, and crepes can be
      used throughout
    the year, and felts may or may not prevail, according to the fashion.    
    </p><h3> <a name="fall" id="fall"></a>Materials for Fall and Winter Hats  </h3>

    <p> For hats in fall and winter the following materials are 
    used:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Heavy satin</li>
      <li> Heavy silk </li>
      <li>Cr&ecirc;pe </li>
      <li>Velvet </li>
      <li>Hatters' plush </li>
      <li>Velveteen </li>
      <li>Duvetyn</li>
      <li>Felt</li>
      <li> Brocade</li>
      <li>Metal cloth</li>
      <li> Metal lace</li>
      <li>Velour</li>
    </ul>
    <h3> <a name="sum" id="sum"></a>Materials for Spring and Summer Hats</h3>
    <p> For spring and summer hats the following materials are most often used:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Satin </li>
      <li>Silk</li>
      <li>Cr&ecirc;pe</li>
      <li>Georgette</li>
      <li>Lace</li>
      <li>Felt </li>
      <li>Horsehair braid</li>
      <li> Fiber braid</li>
      <li> Straw braid</li>
      <li> Ribbon</li>
      <li> Tulle</li>
      <li> Linen</li>
    </ul>
    <h3> <a name="vel" id="vel"></a>Velvet</h3>
    <p> Velvet is always in favor for fall and winter hats because of its deep
      silky pile and soft luster. Two distinct types are used for millinery purposes:
      that with the upright pile and that with the smooth, or flat, pile. The
      velvets
      generally used for dress material and tailoring are much wider and more
      expensive and do not lend themselves as readily to millinery purposes,
      although they
      may be used. All velvets in which the nap, or pile, stands upright are
      known as <em>upright-pile velvets</em>; those which have been ironed or pressed
      flat by
      any process are <em>flat-pile velvets</em>. Millinery velvet is usually narrow,
      the width ranging from 17 &frac12; to 19 inches. It may be woven on a silk,
      linen,
      or cotton back with the pile made of genuine silk or of artificial silk.
      In choosing velvet a piece with a soft, close nap and a firm but pliable
    back should be selected.</p>
    <h3> <a name="teen" id="teen"></a>Velveteen</h3>
    <p> Velveteen is an all-cotton fabric. It is often confused with velvet by
      the inexperienced buyer. It lacks all the fine luster of silk velvet, has
      a stiff,
      harsh back, and collects dust readily. A hat made from velveteen does not
    have the graceful lines that mark one made from velvet.</p>
    <h3> <a name="straw" id="straw"></a>Straw Braid</h3>
    <p> Straw braid may be purchased by the yard or by the bolt, the number of
      yards in a bolt usually ranging from 3 to 12. This braid comes in a great
      variety
      of widths and weaves, and may be used for the construction of the entire
      hat or in combination with silk, satin, georgette, crepe, felt, or ribbon.
      When selecting braid, 
      attention should be given to its pliability, for it is extremely difficult
      to make stiff, harsh braid or braid woven over many coarse cotton cords
    conform to the curves of the brim and the crown.</p>
    <h3> <a name="horse" id="horse"></a>Horsehair Braid</h3>
    <p> The finest grade of horsehair braid is made from real horsehair, but
      much of the braid known by that name is made of fiber or artificial-silk
      threads.
      It may be purchased by the bolt or by the yard, as the straw braids are
      purchased, the usual width being from 1 to 2 inches, and the number of
      yards in a bolt
    from 3 to 10.</p>
    <p> Horsehair braid is used principally for transparent hats, although it
      may be attached to a solid fabric foundation, as the heavier straw braids
      are
    used.</p>

  <h2> FABRIC FRAMES</h2>
    <p> The fabric frame is in use throughout the year; for not only fall and
      winter hats but many spring and summer hats also make use of these frames
      as foundations.
    Commercial frames in many different shapes may be purchased at slight expense,
    but they usually require altering to adapt them to individual requirements.
    Directions for such alterations are given below. Frames may also be made
    from a variety of materials and by different processes. They may be molded
    over blocks of different types (see <em><a href="mp-03-bloc.html">Blocks
    and Blocking</a></em>), they may
    be constructed from copied or drafted patterns (see <em><a href="mp-18-patt.html">Patterns</a></em>),
    or they may be modeled free hand (see <a href="mp-17-mode.html">Modeling</a>).</p>
    <h3> <a name="mat" id="mat"></a><strong><a href="illust/039.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,246);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/039-t.jpg" alt="Figure 39" width="90" height="224" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>MATERIALS USED FOR MAKING FABRIC FRAMES</h3>
    <h6><strong>Figure 9. Frame materials. <em>A,</em> willow; <em>B</em>, buckram; <em>C,</em> stiff
      net; <em>D,</em> flexible net; <em>E,</em> flexible crinoline; <em>F</em>,
      crinoline; <em>G,</em> chiffonette.</strong></h6>
    <p> <strong>Willow</strong> is extremely light in weight and is the only wood-fiber fabric
      used in frame construction. It is made of finely cut strips of wood woven
      and
    pasted upon a background of crinoline. When modeling a brim free hand, willow
    may be cut on the bias, dampened, and pressed into the desired shape with
    the fingers. When dry, it will retain this shape.</p>
    <p> <strong>Buckram</strong> is the stiffest of all frame fabrics and is heavily sized. It
    is used only when extreme stiffness of brim is wanted.</p>
    <p><strong> Stiff net </strong>is the most heavily sized of the frame nets, although less
    stiff than buckram. It is used for lightweight stiff brims.</p>
    <p><strong> Flexible net</strong> has a great deal of elasticity, which makes it most desirable
    for soft rolled brims and brim edges and for folds around crowns.</p>
    <p><strong> Flexible crinoline</strong> is one of the most desirable and convenient of frame
      fabrics for making soft hats. When used on the bias it needs no wiring
      to retain
    its shape. It is soft and pliable and much lighter in weight than flexible
    net. Flexible crinoline is used for all types of blocking and modeling, both
    of brims and of crowns.</p>
    <p><strong> Crinoline</strong> is best known for its many uses outside of millinery. However,
    it is much used in the construction of soft frames. It is extremely light
    in weight and of coarse texture. It is most desirable for free-hand modeling.</p>
    <p><strong> Chiffonette</strong> is very soft and light in weight and is used for edge bindings
    and for linings of soft crowns.</p>
    <p><strong> Tarlatan</strong> is extremely thin and coarse, with a great deal of sizing. It
      is used for lining semi-soft crowns; also brims where only slight stiffening
    is wanted.</p>
    <h3> <a name="alt" id="alt"></a>ALTERATION OF FABRIC FRAMES</h3>
    <h4> <strong>Altering the
    Head Size of the Brim</strong></h4>
    <p> <strong>Increasing.</strong> Most frames come with detachable crowns,
      so that the first step is to remove the pins or cut the threads that hold
      the crown and the
      brim
    together. The back of each may be distinguished by the lapping of 
    the wire, for all wire fastenings are started in the back.</p>
    <p> After the crown has been removed, the brim shows an upright band about
      1 inch in depth around the head size. The head size is enlarged by clipping
    around this band.</p>
    <p> The clipping requires the greatest care, for a slash too deep may spoil
      the head size. It is better to clip a very little at a time, fitting to
      the head
    as one clips.</p>
    <p> <strong><a href="illust/040.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,417);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/040-t.jpg" alt="Figure 40" width="170" height="196" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>The head size seldom needs to be increased on the sides, for usually
      there is sufficient width, though greater length is often required. The
      size is
    increased by cutting about five tabs &frac34; inch wide at the back of the head
    size, on the straight line from the top to the bottom of the headband and
    extending slightly into the brim. This usually will relieve the head-size
    strain; but if the wearer has heavy hair or very large head size, the process
    may have to be repeated at the front of the head-size band (Fig. 40). These
    small tabs are a most important part of the brim and must be formed with
    care. 
    They are brought upright and trimmed to correspond in depth with the rest
    of the head-size band. These 
    tabs should never be cut off, as they are used in fastening the crown to
    the brim.</p>
    <h6><strong>Figure 40. Enlarging the head size of the brim by slashing at the back
      and front of the head size and pulling upright the tabs made by the slashing.</strong></h6>
    <p class="clear"><strong> Decreasing.</strong> In decreasing the head size of a brim care must be taken
      not to alter the frame to any great extent. The method is different with
      brims
    of different types.</p>
    <p><em> <strong><a href="illust/041.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,466);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/041-t.jpg" alt="Figure 41" width="170" height="201" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>For
        the flat brim. </em>Mark the center front of the crown and of
      the brim before detaching. Detach the brim from the 
    crown and remove the crinoline binding and wire from the 
    brim. Slash the brim through the center front and the center back; bring
    the two parts together to the required size with a flat lapping (Fig. 41).
    Sew either with hand-stitching or by the machine. If the former, use the
    stab stitch in even lengths. This method leaves the brim in its original
    shape; and since the frame must be padded before the final covering is put
    on, the parts lapped over are concealed (see <em><a href="#pad">Padding</a></em>).
    Sew the wire to the brim again and cover the edge with a bias crinoline binding
    (<a href="mp-02-bind.html#fig3">Fig.
    3</a>).</p>
    <h6><strong>Figure 41. Decreasing the head size of the brim by lashing the brim in
      half and lapping.</strong></h6>
    <p class="clear"><em> <strong><a href="illust/042.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,452);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/042-t.jpg" alt="Figure 42" width="160" height="183" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>For the mushroom, or drooping, brim. </em>Mark the center fronts, detach the
      brim, and remove the binding and wire as in the preceding method. Slash
      through
    the center back of the mushroom brim, and lap (Fig. 42). This gives a slight
    increase to the droop of the brim, which, if not desired, may be avoided
    by slashing both the front and the back and proceeding as with the flat brim.
    Resew the wire and the crinoline to the edge of the brim. In decreasing the
    head size of a rolled brim either of the methods given above may be used,
    the choice depending on the amount of roll to the brim. If there is an even
    roll all around the brim, slashing at the front and the back and lapping
    is best; if there is an uneven roll, the one slash at the back is used.</p>
    <h6><strong>Figure 42. Slashing brim at back to decrease head size. <em>A</em>, greater
      decreasing; <em>B</em>, lesser decreasing.</strong></h6>
    <h4 class="clear"> <strong>Altering the Outside Line of the Brim</strong></h4>
    <p> <strong>Increasing the width.</strong> Greater width may be given the
      brim by adding bias folds of soft frame material to the edge. This may
      be accomplished, also,
    by adding a fitted flange to the brim (<a href="mp-12-fold.html#fig54">Fig.
    54</a>).</p>
    <p><strong> Decreasing the width.</strong> Put the frame on the head and note carefully where
    the brim is too wide. Remove the binding and the wire from the outer edge
    and trim off the edge where it is too wide. As any great amount trimmed at
    one time may decrease the size too much, it is wiser to trim once, twice,
    or three times, if necessary, each time trying the frame on the head until
    the size desired is obtained. In fitting remember that the expanse of light
    surface always looks larger than when the frame is covered with dark material.</p>
    <h4 class="clear"> <strong>Altering the Head Size of the Crown</strong></h4>
    <p> <strong><em><a href="illust/043.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,658);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/043-t.jpg" alt="Figure 43" width="170" height="154" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Increasing.</strong> Every one-piece plain crown has four bias
      points where the fullness was taken in as the crown 
    was blocked.</p>
    <p> Remove the binding and the wire at the base of the crown. Stretch slightly
    at the four bias points until the desired head size is reached (Fig. 43).
    Sew the wire back in place with a lock stitch.</p>
    <h6><strong><a name="fig43" id="fig43"></a>Figure 43. Enlarging head size of crown by stretching at bias points.</strong></h6>
    <p class="clear"><strong> Decreasing.</strong> Either one of two methods 
      may be used. The first step in both methods is to rip the binding and the
    wire from the bottom of the crown.</p>
    <p> <em><strong><a href="illust/044.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,583);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/044-t.jpg" alt="Figure 44" width="170" height="161" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em>1.
      If not more than 1 inch is to be taken out, it may be removed from one
      place without altering the balance of the crown. Make a vertical slash
      from
    2 to 2&frac12; inches in depth on the straight thread of the material at
    the center back. Lap flat and stitch. If a greater decrease is necessary,
    make
       a slash 2 inches deep at the center front, at the center back, and on
      each
    side on the straight thread of the 
    material. Lap each slash slightly and sew. The result is a perfectly balanced
    crown (Fig. 44). Sew the wire and 
    the crinoline in place at the bottom of the crown. </p>
    <h6><strong><a name="fig44" id="fig44"></a>Figure 44. Decreasing the head size of the crown by slashing at straight
    points and lapping.</strong></h6>
    <p class="clear"><em><strong><a href="illust/045.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,577);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/045-t.jpg" alt="Figure 45" width="170" height="163" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em>2.
      When a decided decrease is needed, slash the crown through the center from
      front to back and lap
    the two halves the required amount (Fig. 45). This will make the bottom line
    slightly uneven at the point of joining. Trim this bottom line; 
    stitch in place; and pad the crown before adjusting the final covering (see
      <a href="#pad">Padding the Frame</a>). Sew the wire and the crinoline
      in place at the bottom of the crown.</p>
    <h6><strong>Figure 45. Decreasing the crown size by slashing through the center from
      front to back and lapping.</strong></h6>
    <h4 class="clear"> <strong>Altering the Head Size of a Frame with Crown and Brim in One</strong></h4>
    <p> <strong>Increasing.</strong> Small hats with the crown and brim blocked in one piece are
        altered in the same way as those with the plain crown. Rip the binding
        and the wire
    from the brim-edge for 3 inches on each side of the center back and stretch
    the head size at the two bias points, taking care to stretch the brim as
    little as possible (<a href="#fig43">Fig. 43</a>). Resew the wire to the brim edge.</p>
    <p><strong> Decreasing. </strong>Remove the binding and the wire from the
      outer edge. Slash through the center back of the brim and into the crown
      about 2&frac12; inches.
      Graduate
    the lapping from the outer edge of the brim to the point 
    at which it disappears into the crown (<a href="#fig44">Fig. 44</a>). Trim the irregular edge-line
    made by lapping; return the wire and the binding to the brim.</p>
    <p> If a further decrease is required, slash through the brim and 2 inches
      into the crown at the center back and at each side on the straight thread
      of the
    material, lapping in the same manner as before. Trim the brim edge even and
    sew the wire and the crinoline into place (<a href="mp-02-bind.html#fig3">Fig.
    3</a>).</p>
    <h3> <a name="pad" id="pad"></a>PADDING THE FRAME</h3>
    <p> When using fabric of light-weight quality for the outer covering of a
      hat, it is often necessary to pad the frame before attaching this covering.
      The
    rough surface of the frame not only takes away from the beauty of the fabric
    but may cause it to cut or wear in handling. A number of inexpensive cotton
    materials may be used, the choice depending on the amount of padding necessary.
    Those most often used are light-weight outing flannel, cotton flannel, and
    unbleached muslin. This padding is especially necessary when pasting is to
    be done.</p>
    <h4> <strong>Process for the Brim</strong></h4>
    <p> Follow the process used in the smooth-fitted brim covering (<a href="mp-04-brim.html#fig14">Fig.
        14</a>)
      except that the facing is not turned in for seaming but is trimmed flush
      with the
    edge of the brim, eliminating all possible bulk.</p>
    <h4> <strong>Process for the Crown</strong></h4>
    <p> Follow the directions given for the tailored crown (<a href="mp-08-crow.html#fig22">Figs.
    22-23</a>).</p>

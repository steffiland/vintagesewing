  <h2> PATTERNS </h2>
    <h3><a name="copy" id="copy"></a>Copying</h3>
    <p> For the inexperienced worker a paper pattern is a great help. These patterns
    are often made by copying the brim or crown of a fabric frame.</p>
    <h4> <strong>Pattern for a Flat Brim</strong></h4>
    <p> Place a flat piece of tissue, paper on the under side of the brim and
      fasten it in place with pins at the front, 
      back, and sides. The paper must be perfectly smooth, for it is on this
      pattern that the accurate cutting of the outside covering depends. With
      the paper
      in place, turn the brim right side up, and through the head-size opening
      mark the exact head size by running a pencil around the 
      oval opening. If the frame is one with the crown attached, hold the frame
      against the light and trace the exact outline of the head size around the
      bottom of the crown. In both cases the circumference of the brim must be
      marked to secure the correct line of the outer edge. Mark the front and
    the back of the pattern.</p>
    <p class="clear"> <strong><em><a href="illust/084.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,485);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/084-t.jpg" alt="Figure 84" width="140" height="171" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em></strong><a name="fig84" id="fig84"></a>Remove the pattern, cut away the extra paper from
         around the outer circle, allow an extra inch for the tabs inside the
      head-size marking toward the center, and cut away the small oval remaining.
      The extra
        inch allowed for tabs is cut into small pieces (on the straight, not
      on the slanting, line) &frac34; inch wide, terminating at the oval that outlines
        the
      head size (Fig. 84).</p>
    <h4 class="clear"> <strong>Pattern for a Mushroom or Rolled Brim</strong></h4>
    <p> This process differs from the one used for the flat brim in that the
      pattern is made from a straight strip of paper with a seam at the back;
      for no
      brim with a decided droop or turn can be covered with an unseamed piece
      of material.
      When material of great stretching tendency is used for the covering of
      a shape slightly 
      mushroom, the seam on the top covering is not needed. Even then, however,
      the facing must be cut for a seam because of the concave surface of the
      under brim. 
      The opposite is true when slightly rolled frames are used. If the hat is
      of decided roll or droop or is irregular in shape, the seam must be used
    on both the top and the facing that the material may lie flat (Fig. 86).</p>
    <p> The strip of paper used for this pattern is cut 1 inch wider than the
      depth of the widest part of the brim. Start pinning at the back of the
      hat, working
      the straight 
      edge of the paper carefully around and flush with the edge of the brim.
      Fullness will be found next to the head size, and this must be taken out
      or the covering
      will not lie flat. To do this, make small darts in the fullness, 
      pinning into place at the head size until the exact duplicate of the brim
      is obtained. The pins must be put in securely, for the one pin that may
      drop out and release a dart when the paper is removed will throw the whole
      pattern
      out of line. Before removing the pattern from <strong><em><a href="illust/085.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,735);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/085-t.jpg" alt="Figure 85" width="150" height="96" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em></strong>the brim run a pencil line
      at the head size so the depth of the tabs may be established. Allow 1 inch
    for the tabs and cut away any extra paper (Fig. 85).</p>
    <p class="clear"> When <strong><em><a href="illust/087.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,573);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/087-t.jpg" alt="Figure 87" width="150" height="137" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em></strong>removed<strong><em><a href="illust/086.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,503);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/086-t.jpg" alt="Figure 86" width="140" height="156" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em></strong> from the brim these two patterns differ in shape. The flat
      pattern will have an unbroken outside line, and the mushroom pattern will
      have a
    decided curve with a V-shaped piece missing at the back (Figs. 86-87).</p>
    <h6><strong>Figure 85. Darts taken in plain strip of paper when making a pattern
      of a rolled or drooping brim.</strong></h6>
    <h6><strong>Figure 86. Finished pattern, showing the head-size tabs and the v-opening
      at the back.</strong></h6>
    <h6><strong>Figure 87. Pattern cut from brim with extreme curve, showing wide back
    opening.</strong></h6>
    <h3 class="clear"> <a name="draft" id="draft"></a>Drafting</h3>
    <p> The selection of a frame is the first important step in hat construction.
      Although commercial frames may be purchased, the variety of shapes is usually
      limited; therefore drafting the frame is an excellent way to show individual
      preferences. By this method any shape desired may be made from a flat piece
    of frame material.</p>
    <p><strong> Drafting a brim. Cutting a circle.</strong> Cut a square of wrapping
      paper about 14 or 15 inches on each side (Fig. 88, <em>A</em>). This square
      must be of such size
      that when folded into quarters each folded side measures exactly the width
      of the brim desired plus half the head size (Fig. 88,<em> B</em>). After
      folding into quarters, fold again on the diagonal; fold the resulting triangle
      again through
      the center. Then fold along the diagonal. Fold the resulting triangle to
      obtain the shape shown in Fig. 88, <em>C</em>. <strong><em><a href="illust/088.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',582,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/088-t.jpg" alt="Figure 88" width="160" height="117" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em></strong>Mark from the point of the
      folded paper on each side of the triangle the exact radius decided upon
      for the 
      brim circle, and cut. When the paper circle is unfolded, there will be
      many definite lines to be seen. These represent the points at which the
      brim is
    to be slashed to form different shapes.</p>
    <h6><strong><a name="fig88" id="fig88"></a>Figure 88. Cutting circle. <em>A</em>, square of paper from which circle
      is to be cut; <em>B</em>, square folded to quarters; <em>C</em>, quarter-folded
      square further folded twice in succession along the diagonal, and marked
      for cutting.</strong></h6>
    <p class="clear"><strong> Cutting out the head size. </strong>The method of measuring the
      head size will be found under <em><a href="mp-16-meas.html">Measurements</a></em>.
      Two methods are used for cutting the head size.</p>
    <p> <strong><em><a href="illust/089.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,363);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/089-t.jpg" alt="Figure 89" width="140" height="153" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em></strong>1. Unfold the paper circle until one fourth open. Measure from the central
      point, first up and then across, to determine the length and the width
      of the head. size, one half the length of the head size for length and
      one half
      the width of the head size for width. This will make the head size slightly
      oval. Mark with pencil. Before cutting make a second marking 1 inch toward
      the 
      center and parallel to the first to allow for the head-size tabs. Make
      the cut along this inner line. The tabs may be slashed to the outer circle
      at
    intervals of &frac34; of an inch around the entire head size (Fig. 89).</p>
    <h6><strong><a name="fig89" id="fig89"></a>Figure 89. Showing shaping of head size and method of making oval from
      a circle.</strong></h6>
    <p class="clear"> 2. Take<strong><em><a href="illust/090.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,549);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/090-t.jpg" alt="Figure 90" width="140" height="159" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em></strong> the measurement of the head size plus 1 inch for lapping, and
      cut a length of wire this size. Join the wire in a circle and shape it
      on the
      head. Place this wire on the paper circle, center for center, and mark
      the head size. Draw a parallel line 1 inch nearer the center for the head-size
      tabs. Cut along this inner circle and slash tabs as before. Pin a 1-inch
      strip of wrapping paper to the tabs. This makes a headband so that the
      pattern
    may be placed on the head (Fig. 90).</p>
    <h6><strong>Figure 90. Drafted pattern.</strong></h6>
    <p class="clear"> If the head size is 24 inches, the length of the oval should be 8&frac12;
      inches and the width 7 inches. Decreasing the head size 1 inch subtracts
      &frac14; of
      an inch from the measurements of length and width given above; increasing
    the head size adds to the measurements in the same proportion.</p>
    <p class="clear"><strong> <em><a href="illust/091.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',454,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/091-t.jpg" alt="Figure 91" width="140" height="77" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Shaping the brim.</strong> To make a drooping or a curved brim slash along the
      creases left from folding, for they represent the definite points of the
      hat brim.
      These slashes are made first at the quarters and then at the eighths if
      much upward or downward droop is desired, and are lapped and pinned to
      produce
      the curved effect. After trying the hat on the head and being sure of the
      shape, the paper draft is slashed through the depth of the brim at the
      back. This may then be placed on the frame material in a flat position,
      pinned
      with the <em>front of the pattern on the straight thread of the material,</em> and
    cut.</p>
    <h6><strong>Figure 91. Slashes lapped and pinned to form curved brim.</strong></h6>
    <h4><strong>Crowns</strong></h4>
    <p> <strong>Oval or round crown top. </strong>Cut a circle 5 or 6 inches
      in diameter from a square of paper, testing on a frame the size of the
      top before cutting
      from the
      fabric. When 
      using an oval top, fold the circle into quarters and cut from the folded
      edge, decreasing as the center is approached so that a perfect oval is
    formed (Fig. 89).</p>
    <p><strong> Tailored, or fitted, crown.</strong> Cut a slightly oval piece
      of paper which will be large enough to cover the top and the curve of the
      crown and to
      extend
    about half an inch over the side crown (<a href="mp-08-crow.html#fig22">Fig.
    22</a>).</p>
    <p class="clear"> <strong><em><a href="illust/092.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,416);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/092-t.jpg" alt="Figure 92" width="140" height="151" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em></strong>As the top of this type of crown is usually smaller 
      than the bottom, it is not possible to use a perfect bias for the side
      crown. Detach the crown from the brim, marking the center front of the
      crown and
      the center front of the brim. Next cut a strip of tissue paper the depth
      of the side crown and place the edge of this 
      strip at the bottom of the crown, pinning securely in place and taking
    up darts where they are needed (Fig. 92).</p>
    <h6><strong>Figure 92. Pattern for fitted, or tailored, side crown. One straight
      edge of the tissue-paper strip pinned flush with the base of the crown,
      with pleats adjustetd at the opposite edge, so that the paper will conform
      to the shape of the crown.</strong></h6>
    <p class="clear"><strong> <em><a href="illust/093.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,752);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/093-t.jpg" alt="Figure 93" width="220" height="171" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Upright
        sectional crown.</strong> Measure for exact head size
      (<a href="mp-16-meas.html#fig81">Fig. 81</a>). Plan the number of sections
      to be used, divide the head size into equal parts,
      plus
      a quarter-inch seam allowance on each side of every section. Cut a strip
      of paper 9 inches long and as wide as required for the width of the crown
      base. Fold lengthwise. To form the sections, start cutting at the point
      2&frac12; inches above the 
      base of the folded strip of paper where the lengthwise edges meet. Slope
      very gradually, following the diagram measurements until a point is reached
      at the top of the section (Fig. 93). If a smaller or a larger head size
      is 
    to be used, decrease or increase the measurements and cut as directed.</p>

      of the crown as the number of sections increases. <em>A</em>, four-sectional
      crown; <em>B</em>, five-sectional crown; <em>C</em>, six-sectional crown.</strong></h6>
    <p class="clear"><strong> <em><a href="illust/094.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',476,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/094-t.jpg" alt="Figure 94" width="200" height="102" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Side
        crown and sectional top in one piece.</strong> Cut a strip
      of paper 9 inches wide and the 
      length of the head size plus &frac12; inch at each end of the strip for
      the joining at the center back of the crown. Fold this strip into as many
      folds
      as the
      number of top sections to be used. Take as a pattern a sectional crown
       of the same number of pieces, measure down from the point of the crown
      along the curved side of the section to a distance of from 4 to 4&frac12; inches,
      and
      cut. This will give the sectional top with the plain side in one piece
    (Fig. 94).</p>
    <p class="clear"><strong> <em><a href="illust/095.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,487);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/095-t.jpg" alt="Figure 95" width="140" height="163" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Separate sectional top. </strong>If a narrow top is wanted, cut
      from a sectional pattern of the same number 
      of sections, making the sections long or short as desired. For a large
      flat top less shaping of the crown is necessary. Cut a circle of the required
      size from a square of paper (<a href="#fig88">Fig. 88</a>). Open the circle one half and refold
      into half as many pieces as the number of sections to be cut. Starting
      at
      the base of the crown top, trim half an inch 
      from each side, sloping to a disappearing point at about one half the depth
      of the section (Fig. 95). Before unfolding, slit along each crease to the
    tip of the section to separate the sections.</p>
    <p class="clear"><strong> <em><a href="illust/096.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',345,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/096-t.jpg" alt="Figure 96" width="200" height="76" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="fig96" id="fig96"></a>Side crown with scalloped edge and oval top. </strong>Cut a strip
      of paper 5 inches deep and the length of the head size plus a half-inch
      seam allowance at
      each end of the strip for joining. Fold the strip into equal parts as for
      the
      upright sectional crown. Measure 3 inches from the bottom of the strip
      to establish the point at which the scallops 
      are to be started. Make the scallops in perfect half circles (Fig. 96).    </p>
    <p> Since the slashes dip into the side crown for nearly half its depth,
       the oval is cut larger than the average oval. Make the oval 11 inches
      wide
    and 12 inches long, marking quarters.</p>
    <p><strong> One-piece circular tam. </strong>Cut a circle 16 inches in diameter from a square
    of paper (<a href="#fig88">Fig. 88</a>).</p>
    <p><strong> Two-piece circular tam.</strong> Cut two circles 12 inches in diameter from a
    square of paper (<a href="#fig88">Fig. 88</a>).</p>
    <p><strong> Beret tam.</strong> Cut two circles 11 inches in diameter from a square of paper
    (<a href="#fig88">Fig. 88</a>).</p>
    <p><strong> Tam with circular top and fitted under crown.</strong> Cut an
      11-inch circle from a square of paper (see <a href="#fig88">Fig. 88</a>).
      The distance around this circle is 35
      inches; the head-size measurement varies with the individual. Cut a straight
      strip
      of paper 5 or 6 inches wide and 35 inches long, plus a half-inch seam allowance
      at each end. Fold the straight strip into eighths, and crease. Place one
      edge of the straight strip along the outer edge of the circle, pinning
      about every 
      2 inches. Make darts at the quarters and eighths of the creased strip to
      form the head size, taking each dart in an equal amount until the correct
      head size is established. Remove the pins from the outer edge but not from
      the darts at the head size. The seam joining is placed at the right side
    (see <a href="mp-08-crow.html#fig36">Fig. 36</a>).</p>

    <p><strong> Front under crown </strong>(Fig. 97, <em>A</em>). Cut a strip of paper 18 inches long and
      7 inches wide. Fold end to end, creasing at the center on the width of
      the
      strip. <em>For the outer cutting line</em> measure down 4 inches along the cut ends,
      and mark. Start cutting at this point and slope gradually upward until
      a flowing curve is obtained which ends at the top of the creased edge.
      <em>For
      the inner cutting line</em> measure down along the fold 5 inches, and mark.
      Mark a point 6 inches from the center fold along the bottom of the strip
      and toward
      the cut ends. Join these two markings with a pencil line in an even curve,
      and cut. Join by a straight line the points at which the inner and outer
    cutting lines have been started. Cut along this line.</p>
    <p><strong> Back under crown </strong>(Fig. 97, <em>B</em>). Cut a strip

        flared tam. </strong>Cut a strip of paper 7 inches
      wide and 10&frac12; inches long and fold lengthwise. Measure 4&frac12; inches
      from the bottom of
      the paper
      along the lengthwise fold, and mark; this represents the widest part of
      the section (Fig. 98). Next measure 2&frac14; inches from the folded edge
      along the
      base, and mark; this marks the width of the base of the crown section.
      Start cutting at this point, sloping outward gradually until the marking
      for the widest part of the section is reached. Make a rounded corner instead
      of
      a point
      and slope inward until the extreme point at the top of the crown is reached.
    Six sections made by these measurements will give a head size of 24 inches.</p>
    <p><strong> Sectional crown with sections running from side to side.</strong> Cut
      a strip of paper 18 inches long and 4&frac12; inches wide. Fold in half
      along the length
      of the
      strip. Fold again end to end. Measure 
      &frac34; of an inch up on the lengthwise fold; cut, gradually sloping the
      curve to the upper corner of the other edge (Fig. 99, A). This forms the
      top
    of the crown and extends from the right to the left side.</p>
    <p> Two crescent-shaped pieces are joined to each side of this central strip.
      Cut a strip of paper 13&frac34; inches long and 6&frac12; inches wide.
      Bring the cut ends together and crease at the center. <em>For the outer
      cutting line</em>      measure
      down 5&frac34; inches along the cut ends, and mark. Start cutting at this
      point and slope gradually upward until a flowing curve is obtained which
      ends
      at the top of the 
      creased edge.<em> For the inner cutting line</em> measure down along the
      fold to a depth of 4 inches, and mark. Mark a point 5 1/8 inches from the
      center
      fold
      along the bottom of the strip toward the cut ends.<strong><em><a href="illust/099.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,292);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/099-t.jpg" alt="Figure 99" width="113" height="223" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em></strong> Join
      these two markings with a pencil line to be assured of an even curve, and
      cut. Join by a straight
      line the points at which the inner and outer cutting lines have been started.
    Cut off the ends of the crescent along this line (Fig. 99, <em>B</em>).</p>
    <p> Two semi-oval pieces are next
      cut to complete the back and the front of the crown. Cut an oval 10 inches
      long and 8&frac12; inches wide. This oval
      is then
      folded 
      through its width and cut along the folded line, making two semi-oval-shaped
      pieces (Fig. 99, <em>C</em>). These are joined to the inner curved line
      of the two crescents.</p>
    <h6><strong>Figure 99. Layouts of pattern for sectional crown with sections running
      from side to side.<em> A, </em>central piece running over top of crown;<em> B,
      </em>crescents joined to central piece;<em> C, </em>semi-ovals joined to
      crescents.</strong></h6>
    <p class="clear"> <strong>Fitted flange. </strong>Make a pattern for the brim as shown
      in pattern for flat brim (<a href="#fig84">Fig. 84</a>). Measure down an equal 
      distance from the outer circle of the brim to determine the cutting line
      for the flange. Mark the line with pencil, and cut. If the brim has a decided
    roll or droop, the flange will have a straight seam joining at the back.</p>
    <h3> <a name="plac" id="plac"></a>Pattern-placing</h3>
    <p> The placing of the pieces of the pattern on the material should be carefully
      planned before any cutting is done. Brim pieces are usually cut from the
      strip of material first, but care must be taken that sufficient material
      of the required shape is left for the crown, folds, bindings, and other
    parts.</p>
    <p> If two different materials, such as velvet for the top and taffeta for
      the facing, are to be used on an irregular brim, the pattern must be placed
      carefully so that each material will come where it is desired. It is not
      unusual for the beginner to discover after the cutting
      is done that she has cut velvet for the facing and taffeta for the top.
      If
      velvet is to be used for the top, lay the velvet on the table with the
      nap up and with the right side of the pattern up also. If used for a facing,
      lay the nap down; 
      but the right side of the pattern is still placed right side up (consider
      the &quot;right side&quot; of the pattern as 
      that side which lay against the facing of the original frame from which
    the pattern was made).</p>
    <p> In cutting large brim pieces from<strong><em><a href="illust/101.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,264);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/101-t.jpg" alt="Figure 101" width="89" height="197" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em></strong> a<strong><em><a href="illust/100.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,316);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/100-t.jpg" alt="Figure 100" width="109" height="201" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em></strong> fabric both ends of which are on
      the straight, place the brim pieces at opposite corners, with the center
      front
      of the pattern on the straight thread of the material. The material in
    between may then be used for bias pieces (Fig. 100).</p>
    <h6><strong>Figure 100. Placing of brim pieces, crown top, and bias strips
        when cutting from strip of material with both ends on the straight.</strong></h6>
    <p class="clear"> If one end of the fabric is on the bias, place the large brim pieces
      with the center front on the straight thread of the material and at the
      straight
      end of the material. This leaves the long bias end for all necessary bias
    strips (Fig. 101).</p>
    <h6><strong>Figure 101. Placing of brim pieces, crown top, and bias strips when cutting
      from strip of material with one end on the bias and one end on the straight.</strong></h6>
    <p class="clear"> If the whole hat is to be made of bias strips it is better to purchase
      material with both ends on the bias. This will eliminate any waste of material.
    Proceed as in cutting a bias (see <em><a href="mp-01-bias.html#mark">Bias</a></em><a href="mp-01-bias.html">,
    Fig. 1</a>).</p>

  <h2> CORDING</h2>
  <p> Cordings are finishes made by covering cords of various sizes with bias
        strips of material. These cord-ings may be used as a seam finish or a
        finish at
    the edge of the brim. They may be inserted between the top and the facing
    or be placed on the outside of both brim and crown for trimming. In the former
    case they may be left with unfinished seam edges; in the latter they must
    have the seam edges turned inside the casing.</p>
    <p><strong> <a name="unfin" id="unfin"></a>Cord with unfinished edges.</strong> The size of the foundation
      cord must be decided upon before the bias strips are cut for the covering.
      Cable cord may be used,
    dividing it into strands if the original size is too large; several 
    strands of yarn may be used for a soft, light-weight foundation; or, if a
    firm and definite line is desired, common binding twine may be employed.
    Cut a bias strip wide enough to cover the foundation cord, allowing a quarter-inch
    seam on each side. <strong><a href="illust/020.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,456);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/020-t.jpg" alt="Figure 20" width="140" height="169" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>If more than one bias strip is needed, cut and sew all
    the strips together, pressing the seams open before starting to sew the strips
       over the foundation cord. Cut the cord the length needed and, starting
      at
    one end, fold the bias strip, right side out, over the cord, with the raw
    edges meeting (Fig. 20). Stitch by hand with the running stitch. 
    The thread should be run close to the cord to give the finished cording a
    round, firm appearance. This cording is then inserted between the two surfaces,
    making an attractive finish.</p>
    <h6><strong><a name="fig20" id="fig20"></a>Figure 20. Cord placed in seam.</strong></h6>
    <p class="clear"><strong> <a name="fin" id="fin"></a>Finished cord. </strong>When a finished cord is to be used, cut
      the bias strips, measuring, seaming, and pressing as explained above for
      the cord with unfinished
      edges.
    Fold the bias strip with the right side in and the raw edges meeting. Measure
    and mark the exact depth of 
    the casing to be made for the cord. Place the casing under the machine foot,
    with the needle at the marked point, and stitch, pulling the bias material
    as much as possible when stitching, so that the line of stitching will not
    be tighter than the unstitched side of the casing when turned. <strong><a href="illust/021.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',528,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/021-t.jpg" alt="Figure 21" width="170" height="108" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>To insert
    the cord in the casing most easily, cut the foundation cord the length of
    the casing strip and, with a heavy double thread 10 or 12 inches long and
    millinery needle, attach the cord to one end of the casing. Then, with the
    eye inserted first, run the needle through, pulling the casing back gently
    into place over the cord (Fig. 21). These cords may be applied in any decorative
    way desired.</p>
    <h6><strong>Figure 21. Cording. <em>A</em>, unfinished cord; <em>B</em>, finished
      cord.</strong></h6>
    <p class="clear"><strong> <a name="cord" id="cord"></a>Corded side crown.</strong> Cording
      may be used instead of plain tucks. Measure off groupings, or divisions,
      as for tucks (see <em><a href="mp-25-stit.html#tsc">Tucked Side Crowns</a></em>),
      making casings for cords 1/8 of an inch wide, so that a light-weight cord
      may be
    threaded into the casing. As in the straight-tucked side crown, the back
    seam is sewed and pressed open before the casings are stitched into place.
    Rip back a few stitches where the casings have been started, to give a space
    for the insertion of the cord. Attach the cord to a bodkin with a heavy thread,
    allowing enough space between the cord and the bodkin to pull easily, and
    pull the cord through the casing. Cut so that the ends of the cord may be
    lapped about 1/16 of an inch. Close the opening with small hand stitches.</p>

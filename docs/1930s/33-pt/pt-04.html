  <h3>  <a name="types" id="types"></a>TYPES AND ESSENTIALS</h3>
  <p> 1. By <strong>tailored pockets</strong> are meant all pockets used in tailored garments,
    with the exception of those in coat linings, regardless of their style or
    position.
    The pockets used in linings, properly termed <em>lining pockets</em>, will prove very
    simple in construction after a knowledge of tailored pockets is gained. There
    are only five distinct standard types of tailored pockets, namely, <em>the
    stand pocket</em>, the <em>flap pocket</em>, the <em>welt</em>, or <em>slit,
    pocket</em>, the <em>patch pocket</em>, and
    the <em>bound pocket</em>. Each type, however, is subject to many modifications in
    shape, some pockets assuming an entirely different appearance from the original
    of its type. It is well to remember, though, that the details of finishing
    pockets that vary from the original types will not be difficult, for the
  principle of making them always remains practically the same.</p>
  <p> 2. In considering the style, shape, position, and size of tailored pockets,
    it is important to know that they are governed more or less by prevailing
    styles at the time they are made, by the style of the garment in which they
    are to be placed, by the taste of the person that is to use them, and by
    their purpose. Such pockets are employed in both long and short coats, in
    skirts, and in dresses. If a pocket is to be used on the breast of a coat,
    it is generally put on the left side, but there are cases where a breast
    pocket is placed on each side. If two pockets are used in this way, however,
    they are generally made smaller than if only one is used, as they are intended
    more for ornament than for service. The stand and the welt type of pocket
    are used most frequently in such places, although the flap and patch types
  are sometimes employed.</p>
  <p> 3. The all-important considerations in the making of tailored pockets are
    accuracy and neatness, for to have a perfect pocket the material must always
    match, whether it is the design or the grain. To beginners, such tailoring
    work may seem difficult, yet by studying each type of pocket diligently and
    doing the actual construction on each so as to come to know every little
    detail, no tailored pocket will be too hard to make. Really, the first step
    to success in work of this kind is a full appreciation of how much neatly
    made pockets add to tailored garments from the standpoint of both utility
    and ornament, and the next step is to be willing to spare no effort in the
  careful working out of every detail.</p>
  <h3>    <a name="stand" id="stand"></a>STAND POCKET</h3>
  <p> <em><a href="illust/tp-01.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,593);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tp-01-t.jpg" alt="Figure 1" width="191" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>4. The first of the tailored pockets to be considered is the <strong>stand
      pocket</strong>,
    an example of which is shown in Fig. 1. This type of 
    pocket really consists of two parts&#8212;the <em>stand</em>, or part that serves
    as a finish for the opening, and is the only part visible, and the <em>pocket
    proper</em>, or <em>pouch</em>, which is inside the garment, that is, between the outside
    material and the lining. The stand pocket is very effective on garments of
    firm material that have wide stitching, as it imparts to them the smart look
    so much sought by wearers of tailored garments. As a rule, the stand pocket
    is used simply as a breast pocket, but sometimes it is placed below the waist
    line at the sides of garments; also,
    it is used in skirts and in dresses. The pocket here shown is for the left
    breast, and its lines are diagonal. Of course, as such pockets may be placed
    in other positions and, as is explained later, the lines may assume various
    shapes, it is well in making them to be careful to have the lines run in
  the directions that will harmonize with the other lines of a garment.</p>
  <p> So that a good knowledge of the way in which to make a stand pocket may
    be gained, the construction of the pocket illustrated in Fig. 1 is taken
    up
    in detail. To get the best results, the actual work should be done, but not
  before each step has been carefully studied and is clearly understood.</p>
  <p> <a name="size" id="size"></a>5. <strong>Size and Position of Pocket</strong>.&#8212;When
    the stand pocket is used as a breast pocket, the stand is generally made
    3&frac12; to 5 inches wide and about
    1 inch deep, and the pocket proper, or part that forms the pouch, about 3&frac12; to
    5 inches wide and of the same depth. As mentioned before, however, the size
    of pockets varies and may be made to meet requirements.</p>
  <p> The position of the pocket is usually marked in the first fitting of the
    garment in which it is to be used, especially if it is to serve 
    as the breast pocket in a coat. After marking the pocket, observe its general
    effect in comparison with the coat design in order to insure correct size
  and shaping.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illust/tp-02.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',439,624);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tp-02-t.jpg" alt="Figure 2" width="200" height="139" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em> <a name="preparestand" id="preparestand"></a>6. <strong>Preparing the Stand
      Pattern</strong>.&#8212;The first step in the making of a
    stand pocket is to 
    make a pattern for the stand, no pattern being necessary for the other part
    of the pocket. To make such a pattern for the pocket shown in Fig. 1, proceed
  as follows, using Fig. 2 as a guide:</p>
  <p> On a piece of paper of suitable size, using a ruler or a square, draw first
    a rectangle, each side of which is 3&frac12; inches and each end of which is
    2&frac14; inches, lettering the corners A, B, C, and D, as -shown. Next, locate
    point
    E 1 1/8 inches below D on line AD, and point F 1 1/8 inches above B on line
    BC. Then connect B and E as well as F and D, with diagonal lines, as shown.
    If
    desired, the upper corners may be rounded off a trifle, as indicated by the
  dotted lines.</p>
  <p> With the outline thus completed, form the pattern by cutting from B to
    E, from E to D, from D to F, and from F to B; if rounded corners are wanted,
    cut on the dotted lines. At the same time, also, so that there will be no
    danger of mistaking the top of the pattern for the bottom when using it as
    a guide in cutting out 
    materials, cut a small notch in the pattern on the bottom line, as indicated
  in the illustration.</p>
  <p> <a name="marking" id="marking"></a>7. <strong>Marking the Garment Material
      for Matching</strong>.&#8212;Having prepared the pattern
    as directed, proceed next to locate the position of the stand on the garment
    material, so as to assist in matching the material of the stand and the garment.
    Good judgment must be exercised in doing this work, because it is imperative
    that the weave and the design of both materials match perfectly at the place
    where the pocket is to appear. It is necessary, also, to take into consideration
    the side of the garment on which the pocket is to come, as well as the direction
  in which it is to slant.</p>
  <p class="clear"> <em><a href="illust/tp-03.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,569);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tp-03-t.jpg" alt="Figure 3" width="183" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>In this case, as the pocket is for the left side of the coat, pin the pattern
    on as shown in Fig. 3; that is, so that its ends are parallel with the lengthwise
    stripes or grain of the cloth and the highest 
    part of the pattern when in this position will come at the left when the
  garment is on the wearer.</p>
  <p> In placing the pattern, it is well to bear in mind that best results will
    be obtained by having its ends come between the stripes instead of directly
    on them; and, in order to make certain that the pattern edges are parallel
    with the stripes, crease the pattern at the exact edge of one of the prominent
  stripes, as shown at <em>a</em>. This crease in the pattern is valuable later
  in cutting out the stand material, for by placing it on the same stripe as
  in the garment material accuracy
  will be assured.</p>
  <p> With the pattern correctly placed, outline its sides and its lower edge
    on the garment material with tailors' white chalk, as shown; tailors' colored
    chalk should always be avoided in such work, as it is next to impossible
  to remove it from some materials.</p>
  <p> 8. When striped material is used for a garment and there is a seam down
    its front, as in the semifitted coat, it is often difficult to match all
    the
    stripes. In a case of this kind, therefore, the best plan is to match only
    the stripes in the front section, rather than those in the side section.
  Otherwise, the procedure is the same as that just mentioned.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illust/tp-04.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',610,741);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tp-04-t.jpg" alt="Figure 4" width="244" height="196" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em> <a name="cutstand" id="cutstand"></a>9. <strong>Cutting Out the Stand</strong>.&#8212;After determining just where the stand
    is to come on the garment, the cutting out of the stand 
    material so that it will match that of the garment is simple. To do this
  work properly, proceed as shown in Fig. 4.</p>
  <p> Place the stand pattern on a piece of the material in exactly the same
    way as directed for marking the position of the stand on the garment. Make
    sure
    to have the pattern slant the same and to have the 
    ends come on the same stripes of the cloth; also, turn back the pattern on
    the creased line to see that the crease comes along the edge of the same
    stripe as in the garment material. Then pin the pattern securely in place
    and cut out the stand, allowing &frac12; inch all around the pattern for the finish
  and turnover. To insure accuracy, this allowance may be marked with chalk.</p>
  <p> Before removing the pattern from the material thus cut out, run a basting
    thread all around the pattern or mark the material with tailors' chalk, so
    that the true outline of the stand will be known in making the pocket. Basting
    is the more satisfactory, as the chalk lines are so easily rubbed off and
    losing the pattern lines would cause trouble in the matching of the design
  or the weave of the materials.</p>
  <p class="clear"> <a name="cutcanvas" id="cutcanvas"></a>10. <strong>Cutting Out the Canvas
      Interlining</strong>.<em><a href="illust/tp-06.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',402,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tp-06-t.jpg" alt="Figure 6" width="220" height="110" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>&#8212;<em><a href="illust/tp-05.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',444,761);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tp-05-t.jpg" alt="Figure 5" width="220" height="126" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>In order to prevent the stand
    of the pocket from sagging when it is on the garment, an interlining of canvas
    is generally inserted between the stand material and its lining. To cut out
    this interlining, proceed as shown in Fig. 5, using a piece of lengthwise
    canvas that has been shrunk. After pinning the pattern in place, as shown,
    cut the 
    canvas exactly the same size as the pattern at the sides and the top, but
    at the bottom allow &frac12; inch for a seam and cut a notch in it, 
  as shown in Fig. 6.</p>
  <p> <a name="puttogether" id="puttogether"></a>11. <strong>Putting the Stand
      Together</strong>.&#8212;With the material and the interlining
    for the stand cut out, you are ready to put them together. Pin the canvas
    to the wrong side of the material and baste them 
    together, basting from the right side of the material. With the right side
    of the material still up, turn all edges except the lower edge over on the
    canvas, being sure to follow the marked pattern lines carefully, and then
    baste them as shown in Fig. 6, always basting from the right side in such
    cases. These edges must be turned absolutely true, so that the lines of the
  finished pocket will be as perfect as possible.</p>
  <p> Next, miter the corners as at <em>a</em>, first trimming the corners as at <em>b</em> and
    then whipping them as at <em>c</em>. If the corners are rounded, take care to bring
    them
    down well when whipping the material edges, so that a graceful, curved line
  will be obtained.</p>
  <p> Now press the stand from the wrong side, and then stitch it. The stitching
    should be the same in width as the outside stitching 
    on the seams of the garment, which usually varies from 3/8 to 5/8 inch from
    the edge. If the corners of the stand are round or if sufficient practice
    has
    not been had in turning accurate corners, it is advisable to outline the
    position of the machine stitching with basting threads. If the stitching
    is not outlined in this way, 
    then the gauge of the sewing machine must be used because the stitching on
  the stand portion must be accurate.</p>
  <p> When the stitching is done, remove all basting except that which marks
    the depth of the stand, and then press the stand again, this time, however,
    from
    the right side and with a damp cloth laid over the material. The stand is
  now ready for the lining.</p>
  <p> <a name="linings" id="linings"></a>12. <strong>Pocket Linings</strong>.&#8212;Before taking up the lining of the stand, it
    may be well to consider the material to be used in lining pockets. For the
    stand
    or the flap of a pocket, a very good quality of satin or silk is most suitable,
    and for the pouch part, especially if a durable pocket is desired, sateen
    of close weave is very satisfactory. Because of the fact that a pocket flap
    or a pocket stand comes on the outside 
  of a garment, the lining material for it should harmonize in color.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illust/tp-07.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,728);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tp-07-t.jpg" alt="Figure 7" width="236" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em> <a name="liningstand" id="liningstand"></a>13. <strong>Lining the Stand</strong>. 
    To line the stand, it is necessary to use a piece of lining of exactly the
    same size as the stand material, for when the seam edges of the lining are
    turned down they will come well inside the stand portion and will not show
    on the right 
    side. Therefore, lay the stand pattern on a piece of the lining material,
    taking care to have the weave of the lining run the same as that of the stand
    material, and cut the lining. Then place the wrong side of the lining to
    the wrong side of the stand and slip-stitch the lining to the stand, as shown
    in Fig. 7, using small stitches. Next, press the stand again, and it will
  be ready to be applied to the garment.</p>
  <p> At this time, also, to serve as a guide in stitching the stand to the garment,
    run a basting thread from the right side, as shown at <em>a</em>, through the lining
  in the mark-stitching.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illust/tp-08.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,678);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tp-08-t.jpg" alt="Figure 8" width="219" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em> <a name="reinforcing" id="reinforcing"></a>14. <strong>Placing the Reinforcing
      Strip</strong>.&#8212;To strengthen the finished pocket,
    it is necessary to place underneath the opening a strip of lining, usually
    a firm, plain cotton, that is 3 inches in depth and 2 
    inches wider than the stand portion. This strip must be cut so that its lengthwise
    threads will run parallel with the opening and the 
    lower edge of the stand, for it must neither give nor pull out of shape.
    In placing this strip, put it on the wrong side of the material, allowing
    two-thirds of it to extend above the mark for the pocket opening. Then turn
    over the material with the strip pinned to it and baste the strip on, as
    shown in Fig. 8, basting from the right side 
  of the garment material in order to have it perfectly smooth.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illust/tp-09.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,614);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tp-09-t.jpg" alt="Figure 9" width="198" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em> <a name="basting" id="basting"></a>15. <strong>Placing and Basting the
      Stand in Position</strong>.&#8212;When the reinforcing
    strip is in position, it is next in order to place the stand 
    in its proper place and baste it. Therefore, to be absolutely sure that the
    stripes of the stand and the garment materials match exactly, pin the stand
    on as illustrated in Fig. 9; that is, so that the basting in the stand is
    directly over the diagonal chalk mark on the garment and its ends come at
    the vertical chalk marks. If it differs even a trifle when placed according
    to the original marks, 
    remove the stand and again mark along each end of the stand, as at <em>a</em> and
  <em>b</em>, for it is imperative that the matching be accurate.</p>
  <p> Having matched the material correctly, remove the pin, turn 
    the stand so that its top will be downwards, and 
    then place it so that its right side will be to the right side of the garment,
    its basting directly over the diagonal chalk mark, and its ends on points
    <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>. Then, after pinning it in this position, baste it in place, basting
    through all thicknesses and lifting the ends of the stand so as to make certain
  that it is straight and that the stripes match exactly.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illust/tp-10.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,561);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tp-10-t.jpg" alt="Figure 10" width="180" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em> <a name="pouch" id="pouch"></a>16. <strong>Preparing the Material for the
      Pouch</strong>.&#8212;To prepare the 
    lining material that is to form the pocket portion, or pouch, first, 
    cut out two pieces of lining, making each about 5 inches square, and then
    pin them so that their right sides are together, as in Fig. 10. Next, to
    give the top of the pocket portion exactly the same slant as the stand and
    thus permit it to hang straight across the bottom, as it should, draw a diagonal
    line from a point 1 1/8 inches below the upper left-hand corner of the lining
    material, as at <em>a</em>, on the lengthwise edge, to the upper right-hand
    corner and cut along this line. At 
    this time, also, round off the lower corners, in the manner shown in the
  illustration.</p>

      the Pouch</strong>.&#8212;Unpin the two pouch pieces and
    baste them in place, as shown in Fig. 11. Baste one piece over the pocket
    stand so that the stitches will come exactly in line with the basting on
    the stand, as at <em>a</em>, and the other piece as at <em>b</em>, leaving
    a space of just &frac12; inch between the basting of the pieces and <em>taking
    care not to catch the
    raw edges of the stand portion.</em> Keep a true basting line in each case and
  extend it exactly to the ends of the stand portion and no farther.</p>
  <p class="clear"> As will be observed, the seam edges of the pouch material overlap a trifle;
    this, however, is as it should be, because an ample seam 
    allowance is required to prevent the pocket from pulling out when in use.
    With the basting done, stitch the pouch pieces in the manner shown in <em><a href="illust/tp-12.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,504);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tp-12-t.jpg" alt="Figure 12" width="161" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Fig.
    12. First, stitch the piece over the stand, stitching through the basting
    that holds the stand to the garment and just to the end of the stand, or
    termination of the basting, as at <em>a</em>. Then stitch the other pouch
    piece along the basting, beginning &frac14; inch from one end of the basting and
    ending &frac14; inch
    from the other end. The 
    stitching must be shorter on this side than on the other, so that it will
    not show when the stand is turned in its proper position. Then, too, sufficient
    space must be left between the stitchings to permit the ends of the pocket
    to be finished and thus made secure. When the stitching is completed, bring
    the ends of the thread through to the wrong side and fasten them securely;
  then remove all bastings that have been replaced with stitching.</p>
  <p> <a name="opening" id="opening"></a>18. <strong>Cutting the Pocket Opening</strong>.&#8212;So
    that the opening for the pocket may be cut, turn the seam allowance back,
    as shown at <em>b</em>    and <em>c</em>, Fig. 12. Then, with a pair of very
    sharp-pointed scissors, cut the opening, inserting the point of the scissors
    at the center, as at <em>d</em>, and
    cutting from the center to within &frac14; inch of each end 
    of the stand stitching, as indicated at <em>e</em>. Next, cut precisely to each corner
    of this stitching in a diagonal line, exercising the greatest care, for the
    clipping should not extend so far as to weaken the ends of the pocket. By
    cutting the corners in this manner, there remains at each end a triangular
  piece that must be secured to the lining later.</p>
  <p class="clear"> <a name="completepocket" id="completepocket"></a><em><a href="illust/tp-13.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,606);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tp-13-t.jpg" alt="Figure 13" width="200" height="205" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>19. <strong>Completing
      the Pocket</strong>.&#8212;With the opening thus made, turn the pocket pieces to the wrong
    side by slipping them through the opening, when the 
  outside of the pocket will appear as shown in Fig. 13.</p>
  <p> Next, baste the lower edge of the stand, as at <em>a</em>, slipping two fingers
    of the left hand underneath the stand and in the opening, so that the underneath
    portion of the pocket will not be caught. Next, secure the triangular piece
    at each end of the opening to the under pouch part, as at <em>b</em>. Then, so as
    to make sure that the pocket will &quot;set&quot; perfectly, and, if of striped
    material, that the stripes will match 
  exactly, baste the upper edge of the stand to the garment, as at <em>c</em>. </p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illust/tp-14.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,504);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tp-14-t.jpg" alt="Figure 14" width="161" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>With
      the stand thus basted and the triangular portions secured, turn the garment
      over so that the wrong side of the pocket is up, 
      as in Fig. 14, and fasten the ends of the stand from the wrong side with
      buttonhole twist, as at <em>a</em> and<em> b</em>. In doing this, begin at the bottom of
    the stand and take short, diagonal stitches to the top of the stand; then,
    reversing
      the direction of the stitch, work down to the starting point, crossing
    the stitches, as shown. Do not let these stitches go through to the outside
    of
    the stand.</p>
  <p> Next, baste the pouch portions together, trim them off evenly, and stitch
    them, as at <em>c</em>, being careful to catch the reinforcing strip. If
    the lining is likely to fray, overcast the edges, as at <em>d</em>. Finally,
    remove all basting, and press the pocket thoroughly. When thus completed,
    the stand pocket will appear on the right side as in Fig. 1 and
    on the wrong
  side as in Fig. 14.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illust/tp-15.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tp-15-t.jpg" alt="Figure 15" width="220" height="165" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em> <a name="standvar" id="standvar"></a>20. <strong>Stand-Pocket Variations</strong>.&#8212;As has been mentioned, each type of pocket
    is subject to many modifications in shape. To form a definite idea of some
    of the variations of the stand pocket, note the examples given in Fig. 15.
    These pockets differ only so far as shape is concerned, and no difficulty
    will be encountered in making them or other styles, or even in creating different
    shapes, provided the construction and finishing of the stand pocket just
  discussed are thoroughly understood.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"> <a name="flap" id="flap"></a>FLAP POCKET</h3>
  <p> <em><a href="illust/tp-16.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,671);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tp-16-t.jpg" alt="Figure 16" width="217" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>21. The next type of tailored pocket to be considered is the <strong>flap
      pocket</strong>,
    one style of which is illustrated in Fig. 16. This pocket also consists of
    two parts&#8212;the <em>flap</em>, which serves both as a finish for the pocket opening
    and as protection for the pocket itself, and the <em>pouch</em>, which is similar
    to that of the stand pocket. The flap pocket is a very desirable one, as
    it is adaptable to nearly all tailored fabrics and its size, shape, and position
    can be varied to give 
  pleasing effects on many kinds of garments.</p>
  <p> The materials required for the flap pocket&#8212;that is, for the lining
    and the reinforcement&#8212;are practically the same as those for the stand
    pocket, and, in fact, the making of this type of pocket differs very little
    from the making of the other type, it being necessary also to match the material
  very accurately. As will be observed, the flap of this type of pocket resembles
    the stand of the other, its chief difference being that it is placed in the
    reverse
  position.</p>
  <p>    <a name="position" id="position"></a>22. <strong>Determining the Position</strong>.&#8212;Flap pockets are generally placed at
    the sides of garments, and as a rule two pockets are made at the same time,
    one for each side. In such a case, therefore, so that the pockets will be
    exactly the same in size and shape when finished, mark-stitching must be
    used to mark the pattern lines of the flap, as well as the position of the
  pocket on the garment.</p>
  <p> The position and the width of the flap pocket should be decided in the
    first fitting. The exact place where the pocket is to come should be determined
    when the garment is on, the location usually being governed by Dame Fashion,
    who calls for different positions, sizes, and shapes each season. The procedure,
    when these points 
    are decided, is to mark with tailors' chalk the exact position and approximate
    size, remove the garment, pin it together carefully so that the seams or
    pattern edges on each side will correspond exactly, lay the garment out on
    a flat surface, and carefully mark-stitch on the chalk line through both
    thicknesses of the garment so that the pocket will come exactly in the same
  position on each side.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illust/tp-17.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',378,621);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tp-17-t.jpg" alt="Figure 17" width="200" height="119" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em> <a name="prepareflap" id="prepareflap"></a>23. <strong>Preparing the Flap
      Pattern</strong>.&#8212;The only pattern required for the flap
    pocket is that for the flap. To get the dimensions required for the pattern
    in the actual making of flap pockets in garments, it is necessary to measure
    the chalked outline. To make a pattern for the pocket shown in Fig. 16, which
    is of average size, proceed as shown in Fig. 17, using a piece of paper of
  suitable size.</p>
  <p> First, draw a rectangle, each of whose sides is 4&frac12; inches and each
     of whose ends is 2&frac14; inches, lettering the corners A, B, C, and D,
     as shown. Next, locate point E &frac14; inch to the right of B on line AB
     and point F &frac14;
    inch to the left of D on line CD. Then connect points  A and F, as
    well as C and E, with diagonal lines. If slightly 
    rounded corners are desired at the lower edge of the flap, the pattern may
  be so marked, as indicated by the dotted lines.</p>
  <p> With the drafting thus completed, form the pattern by cutting from A to
    F, from F to C, from C to E, and from E to A. For round corners, cut on the
  dotted lines.</p>
  <p> <a name="cutflap" id="cutflap"></a>24. <strong>Cutting Out the Flap</strong>.&#8212;With the pattern thus prepared, proceed to
    cut out the material required for the flaps. Pin the flap pattern on a double
    thickness of the garment material, placing it so that the stripe, or at least
    the weave, of the flap material will match that along the pocket mark of
    the garment material; in other words, match the material in the manner explained
  for the stand pocket.</p>
  <p> If the material is dark, outline the pattern edges with tailors' white
    chalk; then cut all the way around the pattern, allowing 3/8 inch for seams,
    and,
    after removing the pattern, mark-stitch all the chalk lines. If the material
    is of the kind on which tailors' white chalk will not show, cut the material
    in the manner directed, but mark-stitch around the pattern before removing
    it. With the material 
    cut out, cut the pieces of lining required for the flaps, making them the
  same in size as the pieces of material for the flaps.</p>
  <p> <a name="makeflap" id="makeflap"></a>25. <strong>Making the Flap</strong>.&#8212;Next,
    proceed with the making of each flap. To do this work correctly, place the
    right side of the lining to the right
    side
    of the material and baste them together from the cloth side, beginning at
    the top of one end and continuing around to the top of the other, but not
    across the top. In basting, hold the flap material a trifle full in order
    that the lining will be a 
    little smaller; then, when the flap is stitched, the lining will not show
  along the edges.</p>
  <p class="clear"> <em><a href="illust/tp-18.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',475,786);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tp-18-t.jpg" alt="Figure 18" width="220" height="131" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>With the basting done, stitch just outside of the mark-stitching where
    it is basted, as shown at <em>a</em>, Fig. 18, continuing to the edge, as
    at <em>b</em> and
    <em>c.</em>    Do not 
    stitch the upper edge of the flap, as it must be left open to permit the
  flap to be turned right side out.</p>
  <p> Next, remove all basting and mark-stitching threads except the mark-stitching
    at <em>d</em>, which indicates the top of the flap, and trim the seam edges
    in the manner shown at <em>e</em>, trimming, in firm material, to within
    1/8 inch of the stitching.</p>
  <p> Now, turn the flap right side out and baste it a scant &frac14; inch from the
    edge, taking care that the seam is rolled out to the edge. Then baste another
    row
    about &frac12; inch from the first row, using a short basting-stitch to hold the
    edge firm. When the basting is completed, press the flap thoroughly, and,
    after adjusting the gauge of the sewing machine, stitch the bottom and ends
    of the flap the same distance from the edge as the seams of the garment are
    stitched, usually 3/8 to 5/8 inch. If no stitching appears as a seam trimming
    on the right side of a garment, then the flap should be carefully pressed
  and applied without stitching on the outer edge.</p>
  <p> Next, remove all the basting at the edge, and then run a basting through
    the lining along the upper edge at the mark-stitching. This marking is done
    so that it will show on the lining side, and also so that the mark-stitching
    can be taken out at this time in order to 
  avoid catching it when stitching the flap in position with the sewing machine.</p>
  <p> <a name="applystrip" id="applystrip"></a>26. <strong>Applying the Reinforcing
      Strip and Flap</strong>.&#8212;Having made the flap
    in the manner directed, it is next in order to secure it 
    to the garment, to make the opening, and to apply the pouch part of the pocket.
    As in making the stand pocket, it is first advisable to place a reinforcing,
    or stay, strip in position. Therefore, pin to the wrong side of the garment
    material a lengthwise stay strip of firm, plain cotton that is 2 inches deep
    and 1&frac12; inches longer than the width of the pocket, placing it so that
      its lengthwise center is directly under the chalk marks on the material,
      and
  then baste it in position.</p>
  <p> <em><a href="illust/tp-19.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,404);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tp-19-t.jpg" alt="Figure 19" width="128" height="211" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Next, baste the flap to the material in the manner shown in Fig. 19; that
    is, with its right side to the right side of 
    the material and its basting line directly on the chalk mark on the garment
  material. The flap is turned upward.</p>
  <p> <a name="applypouch" id="applypouch"></a>27. <strong>Applying the Pouch
      Portion</strong>.&#8212;As in making the stand pocket, cut
    out the lining material for the two pieces that form the pouch. Cut each
    of these pieces 1&frac12; inches wider than the flap or the pocket opening,
    but make the depth of only one equal to the desired depth of the pocket;
    for
    the other, make the depth 2 inches less than the pocket depth, but to this
    piece, as shown at <em>a</em>, stitch 
    a lengthwise strip of the garment material that is 2 inches in depth 
    and of a width equal to the width of the piece. This strip of garment material
    on the pouch part must be used in order to prevent the lining from showing
    on the right side of the garment when the flap of the finished pocket is
  lifted. </p>
  <p>Baste the full-sized piece over the flap, as shown at <em>b</em>; that is,
      with its right side down and so that the basting will be on top of the
    basting with which the flap
      was basted on. Baste on the piece with the garment material 
      attached, or the lower part of the pocket, as at <em>c</em>, with its right
      side down and the piece so placed that the basting will be &frac12; inch from
      that holding
    the other piece.</p>
  <p> <a name="complete" id="complete"></a>28. <strong>Completing the Pocket</strong>.&#8212;With
    the pouch pieces thus basted in place, replace the basting with stitching.
    Having finished this stitching,
    remove all the basting and
  fasten the thread ends on the wrong side.</p>
  <p> Then, holding the seam edges apart, cut
    the pocket opening, following the directions given in connection
    with the stand pocket; that is, cutting to within &frac12; inch of each end
    and then diagonally to the end of the flap, as well as to the end of the
  stitching of the lower part of the pocket.</p>
  <p class="clear"> <em><a href="illust/tp-20.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,573);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tp-20-t.jpg" alt="Figure 20" width="184" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>29. After cutting the opening for the pocket, slip both pouch pieces through
    the opening, turn the flap down from the right side of the garment, and baste
  in the manner shown at <em>a</em>, Fig. 20.</p>
  <p class="clear"> Next, <em><a href="illust/tp-21.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,502);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tp-21-t.jpg" alt="Figure 21" width="161" height="204" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>as<em><a href="illust/tp-22.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,529);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tp-22-t.jpg" alt="Figure 22" width="170" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em> in Fig. 21, bring the lower portion up, allowing the material
    to extend up far enough to fill the space between the stitching of the flap
    and that of 
    the bottom, as shown at <em>a</em>, thus forming a welt, which aids in concealing
    the lining when the flap is lifted. Then turn the seam down and baste, as
    shown at <em>b</em>, slipping the fingers inside the pocket opening so as to prevent
    the stitches from catching the material underneath. Next, stitch along the
    lower edge, as at<em> c</em>, and bring the other pocket portion down into position,
    as in Fig. 22. Now turn under the triangular pieces to the wrong side and
    fasten them through both thicknesses, as shown at <em>a</em>; also, to strengthen
    the pocket, finish the ends of the pocket opening with the overcast bar,
  as shown at <em>b</em>.</p>
  <p class="clear"> Next, baste and stitch <em><a href="illust/tp-23.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,587);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tp-23-t.jpg" alt="Figure 23" width="189" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>the pouch portions together, as at <em>c</em>, and then overcast
    the edges, as shown. With all the stitching done, remove all the bastings
    and press the pocket thoroughly from the right side. The flap pocket should
    now appear on the right side as in Fig. 16, and on the wrong side, as in
  Fig. 23.</p>
  <p class="clear"> <a name="flapvar" id="flapvar"></a><em><a href="illust/tp-24.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,402);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tp-24-t.jpg" alt="Figure 24" width="134" height="210" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>30. <strong>Flap-Pocket Variations</strong>.&#8212;Several variations of the flap pocket are
    illustrated in Fig. 24. These pockets should serve to make clear the way
    in which flap pockets of different shapes may be applied, and to provide
    suggestions for developing other pockets. As will be observed, the flaps
    may be circular, triangular, or of novelty shape, and they may have square
    or round corners; also buttons and buttonholes and other trimming may be
    added to create the right effect. In every case, however, the-shape of the
    flap, the stitching, and the trimming are in harmony with the garment on
    which they are used, a point that should always be borne in mind in connection
  with garment making.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"> <a name="welt" id="welt"></a><em><a href="illust/tp-25.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',499,574);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tp-25-t.jpg" alt="Figure 25" width="220" height="190" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>WELT, OR SLIT, POCKET</h3>
  <p> 31. The third type of pocket, namely, the <strong>welt</strong>, or <strong>slit,
      pocket</strong>, 
    is illustrated in Fig. 25. This type of pocket has neither a stand nor a
    flap, simply a slit, or opening, secured with welt edges, and a pouch. Although
    the opening of the pocket shown here is in the  form of a reversed curve,
    or &quot;line of beauty,&quot; as it is sometimes
    called, openings in the form of other curves, as well as straight and diagonal
  lines, may be used effectively, as is pointed out later.</p>
  <p> The welt, or slit, pocket is used as a breast pocket; at the sides of a
    garment, below the waist line, as a pocket for a handkerchief, car fare,
    or any 
    small article; and sometimes simply to create an ornamental effect on a
    garment. If it is to be used as a breast pocket, as in this case, the opening
    should never be more than 3 1/8 or 3 5/8 inches wide, but if it is to be
    used in the lower part of a coat or a skirt it may be from 1 to 1&frac12; inches
    wider.</p>
  <p> No difficulty should be met in constructing the welt, or slit, pocket;
    for, with a good idea of how the stand and the flap pocket are made, the
    making
  of this pocket should be comparatively easy.</p>
  <p> <a name="curved" id="curved"></a>32. <strong>Preparing the Pattern for
      the Curved Opening</strong>.&#8212;The 
    curved opening for the pocket shown in Fig. 25 may be drawn freehand or with
  the aid of any circular article, such as a drinking glass. But no matter what
      method is followed, it is necessary that you get the correct slant to the
      reversed curve, so that when it is transferred to the
    material
  in which the pocket is to be made it will assume a good line and appear well-balanced.</p>
  <p class="clear"> <em><a href="illust/tp-26.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',323,534);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tp-26-t.jpg" alt="Figure 26" width="200" height="114" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>For the pocket here shown, the opening of the original of which is practically
    3&frac12;  inches wide, it will perhaps be best to make a pattern in the
    manner shown in Fig. 26. Therefore, on a piece of paper of suitable size,
    draw first
    a
    rectangle whose top and bottom lines are each 3 inches and whose sides, or
    ends, are each 1&frac12; inches, and then, as shown, letter the upper right-hand
    corner A and the lower left-hand corner B. Then connect A and B with a diagonal
  line and mark the center of this line C.</p>
  <p> With this done, proceed to draw the curve, extending it from B, below the
    diagonal line up to C, and from C above the diagonal line to A. Exercise
    great care to shape the curves attractively, being guided by the shaping
    shown in Fig. 26 and blending the curves together at point C with a free-hand
    line if you use some circular object for outlining the reversed curves below
    and above the diagonal line. With the curve outlined, cut it from A, through
    C, to B; then cut from A along the upper line of the rectangle, and from
    the upper left-hand corner to B. The pattern, which consists of the part
  above the curve, will then be ready for outlining the opening on the material.</p>
  <p> 33. As has been stated, the curved edge of any circular article may be
    used in drawing the curved line, or it may be drawn freehand. In either case,
    however, it is advisable to draw a rectangle first and then, so as to be
    sure of the proper slant for the curve, to connect two of its corners with
    a diagonal line, the direction, or slant, of which will depend on which side
  of the garment the pocket is to appear.</p>
  <p> Of course, pockets of different size and curves of different curvature
    will require rectangles of different sizes, and just what the size ought
    to be
    must be determined by experiment. A good plan is first to decide on what
    the width and the slant of the pocket openings are to be and then, by actual
    measurement, determine what the length of the top, bottom, and side lines
    of the rectangle must be to accommodate the opening. The value of such a
    pattern lies in the fact that it insures accuracy, for its side or its top
    may be placed on a stripe or the grain of the garment material; whereas,
    if no such plan were followed, there would be danger of having the 
  curved opening appear crooked on the garment and thus detract from its appearance.</p>

      the Material for the Pocket</strong>. 
    With the pattern made ready, lay it on the garment at the place where the
    pocket opening is to appear, being careful to have it straight, and then
    outline the opening by drawing a chalk line along the curved edge of the
  pattern.</p>
  <p> Next, on the wrong side of the material, baste a lengthwise piece of firm,
    plain cotton 2&frac12; inches deep and 5 inches wide, with the ends shaped
    as in Fig. 27, directly under the mark made on the right side for the pocket
    opening.
    Then, from the right side, run a basting thread along the mark and through
    the basted reinforcing strip, as at <em>a</em>, so as to outline the pocket
    opening on the wrong side, using very short stitches and following the curve
    exactly.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illust/tp-28.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,537);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tp-28-t.jpg" alt="Figure 28" width="172" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em> <a name="secure" id="secure"></a>35. <strong>Securing the Pocket Material
      to the Garment</strong>.&#8212;Next, as shown in
    Fig. 28, pin to the garment material, over the marked pocket opening, a piece
    of material cut about 3&frac12; inches by 5 inches, placing it right side
    down and taking care to match the stripes of the material if there are any.
      If there
    are no stripes in the material used, at least the weave of the materials
    must be matched; 
  that is, the lengthwise threads of each must run in exactly the same direction.</p>
  <p> When this piece is properly matched and pinned in position, secure it in
    place from the wrong side by basting &frac12; inch from the marked threads, as
    shown at <em>b</em> and <em>c</em>, Fig. 27. Then, with the sewing machine,
    stitch it and the reinforcing
    strip in place, stitching from the wrong side and within 1/8 inch of each
    side of the marked thread, as well as across each end, as at <em>d</em>. Extreme care
    must
    be exercised in doing this stitching, for to have the pocket opening correct,
    the lines must conform to its outline and the space between the stitching
    must be exactly 
    the same for the entire length of the curve. Now remove the basting between
    the rows of stitching, as well as the diagonal basting just outside of the
  stitching.</p>
  <p> <a name="cutopen" id="cutopen"></a>36. <strong>Cutting the Pocket Opening</strong>.&#8212;The
    next step is to cut the opening for the pocket. Therefore, with a pair of
    sharp-pointed scissors, cut from
    the center to within &frac14; inch of each end of the curved opening 
    and then in a diagonal line to each corner, as at <em>e</em> and <em>f</em>,
    Fig. 27, and also as in Fig. 28. In cutting this opening, it is well to keep
    in mind the importance
    of exercising care when the seam allowance 
    is so narrow, as well as the necessity of keeping the cutting line an even
  distance from the stitching.</p>

      Opening</strong>.&#8212;With
    the pocket opening cut, slip the material through the slit in the manner
    indicated 
    in Fig. 29, smoothing it back carefully at the ends. Then baste, as at <em>a</em>    and <em>b</em>,
    holding the seam back from underneath with the forefinger of the left hand
    and along the top with the thumb, so that it cannot be caught in with
    the welt edges. Have the welts fill the entire space between the stitching
    and make them of the same 
    width on each side of the opening of the pocket. Before starting the basting,
    it is well to test the width that the welt will have to be to accomplish
    this; then begin to baste very close to the edge, as shown. At this time,
    also form into plaits on the wrong side the material at the ends of the pocket.
    In some materials, 
  these plaits may be shrunk out by pressing with a very hot iron and wet cloth.</p>
  <p class="clear"> <em><a href="illust/tp-30.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',568,654);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tp-30-t.jpg" alt="Figure 30" width="220" height="190" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>After this basting is done, baste the welts together with diagonal basting,
    as shown in Fig. 30, so as to make sure that their edges are true, and then,
    placing a press cloth over the wrong side of the material, press the pocket
  thoroughly.</p>

    the pouch portion, cut two pieces of silk lining, each 5 inches wide and
    3&frac12; inches long, and shape them as
    shown in Fig. 32. To one piece of lining, stitch 
    a strip of the garment material 2&frac12; inches wide on the lengthwise
    and 4&frac12; inches on the crosswise, placing the right side of the strip
    to the right side of
    the pouch material, as shown at <em>a</em>, Fig. 33. Then stitch the other
    pouch piece to the lower edge of the pocket, as shown in Fig. 32. Now place
    the piece
    of pouch material to which the strip of material is sewed, directly over
    the pocket, having the right side next to the pocket and the edges even.
    Then baste and stitch the upper edge of 
    the pocket opening the same width as directed for the lower edge, stitching
    through all thicknesses and fastening the ends of the 
    stitching threads on the wrong side. Next, baste and stitch the pouch portions
    together, and, if necessary, trim and overcast the edges. In stitching the
    pouch portions together, take care to catch the reinforcing strip, as in
  Fig. 34, so that it will be held to the pocket itself.</p>
  <p class="clear"> <a name="finish" id="finish"></a>39. <strong>Finishing the Pocket</strong>. 
    Next, finish each end of the opening either with an arrowhead, as shown in
  Fig. 25, or with the overcast bar.</p>

    which must be left until the garment is finished, and press the pocket 
    thoroughly. If the material is heavy, trim away the surplus material on the
    back of the pocket so that not all the edges will come at the same place,
    as they are likely to form a ridge when pressed. When completed, the pocket
  should appear on the right side as in Fig. 25 and on the wrong side as  in Fig. 34.</p>

    few variations of the slit pocket are illustrated in Fig. 35. As will be
    observed, the slit may 
    be made to assume various shapes and the pocket itself be placed in different
    positions; but, of course, the construction of the pocket is 
    always the same. Many decidedly pleasing effects can be secured by using
    just the correct position and shape of slit to harmonize 
    with the garment on which the pocket is to be used. In placing pockets on
    a garment, as well as all other trimmings, due regard should always be given
  to the style of the garment itself and to current fashions.</p>

    this method may be applied to pockets made in woolen as well as cotton garments.
  They are especially suitable for wool dresses and semitailored jackets.</p>
  <p class="clear"> <a name="makewelt" id="makewelt"></a>42. <strong>Making the Simplicity

    the garment, as at <em>a</em>, Fig. 37, and stitch, as at<em> b</em>, around the sides and

    up and forming welts to the right side as in the welt pocket; then fold it
    in shape on the wrong side, at the ends, as at <em>a</em>, Fig. 38, and stitch from
    the right side just outside the seam of the lower welt, this appearing on
    the wrong side as at <em>b</em>. Next, baste the other pocket piece over the first
    one, edges even, and, 
    from the right side, stitch just outside the seam of the upper welt to meet
    the stitching in the lower welt. This stitching is shown at <em>c</em> on the wrong
    side. Remove the bastings, turn the edges toward each other, as at <em>d</em>, baste,
    and stitch around them, as at <em>e</em>. Tie all thread ends and press the pocket
  neatly.</p>
  <p> <a name="choosepouch" id="choosepouch"></a>43. <strong>Choosing Material
      for the Pouch Portion</strong>.&#8212;The simplicity welt
    pocket here shown is of striped material. If the stripe of the material used
    for
    such a pocket is very prominent, then the pocket portion, or pouch piece
     that forms the welt, should be made of material that is white or of a plain
    color that harmonizes with the color of the garment, for, as will 
    be observed, the stripes will run irregularly and will not appear so attractive
    as would plain material in the pocket opening. The other pouch piece should
  be made of the striped material.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"> <a name="patch" id="patch"></a>PATCH POCKETS </h3>
  <h5><a name="nature" id="nature"></a>NATURE OF PATCH POCKETS</h5>
  <p> 44. A <strong>patch pocket</strong> is merely a piece of properly shaped material stitched
    to the outside of a garment in a manner not unlike 
    that of a plain-apron pocket. To take away the severe plainness of a pocket
    in the form of a simple patch, it is common to resort to trimming and plaits;
    nevertheless, a pocket applied in the manner 
    stated, whether trimmed, plaited, or plain, does not lose its identity. In
    making patch pockets, the chief essential is neatness. Especially is it necessary
    to turn the corners evenly and to use care in placing the pocket in position
    in order not to have it appear drawn or too full over the material. After
    having made the pockets thus far discussed, little difficulty will be experienced
  in making the patch pocket, as it is the most simple.</p>
  <h5> <a name="plain" id="plain"></a>PLAIN PATCH POCKET</h5>
  <p> 45. The first pocket to be considered is the plain patch pocket, which,
    owing to its simplicity, is not illustrated. To make such a pocket, first
    cut out
    the material, shaping it to suit the style of the garment. As a finish, place
    a 1&frac14; or 1&frac34;-inch hem across the top; then turn the outer
    edges to the wrong side, baste it to the garment, and stitch it in place.
    With
    the
    stitching
    done and the thread ends secured neatly on the wrong side, remove the bastings
  and thoroughly press the pocket from the wrong side.</p>
  <h5 class="clear"> <a name="patchstrap" id="patchstrap"></a>PATCH POCKET WITH STRAP AND FLAP</h5>
  <p class="clear"> <em><a href="illust/tp-39.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,542);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tp-39-t.jpg" alt="Figure 39" width="174" height="206" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>46. In Fig. 39 is shown a patch pocket with trimming in the form of a strap
    and a flap. This style of patch pocket is neat, attractive, and suitable
    for many styles of tailored coats and skirts, especially unlined coats, sport
    coats, and little boys' coats to which it is desired to give a mannish effect.
    It is cut a trifle narrower at the top than at the bottom, so that it will
    balance well with the garment and impart a trim appearance. This difference
    between the width at the top and the bottom of the pocket, however, must
    be so slight as to be scarcely noticeable&#8212;just enough to give a neater
  line than if the top and the bottom were the same in width.</p>
  <p> A piece of material 4&frac12; to 5&frac12; inches square is required for
    this pocket, the size for a garment, of course, depending on the kind, style,
    and position
    of the pocket itself. To insure accuracy, however, it is advisable to prepare
  a paper pattern that is exactly the shape and size of the pocket desired.</p>
  <p> 47. <strong>Cutting the Pocket</strong>.To prepare the pattern,
    use in this case a piece of paper that is 4&frac12; to 5&frac12; inches
    square or a little larger than the
    desired pocket. Trim off the sides a little at the top, so 
    as to make it narrower there than at the bottom; then round off the 
    corners at the lower edge with graceful curves, as the pocket in Fig. 39
    shows. In some instances the corners of such pockets are 
    left square, but they are a little more difficult to keep true than are the
    round corners; also, it is harder to get one side of the pocket with square
    corners to correspond with the other, especially when stitching is added.</p>
  <p>When the pattern is made and in position on the material, the pocket may
    be cut out and mark-stitched and basted on the pattern lines so as to keep
    the edges even.</p>
  <p class="clear"> <em><a href="illust/tp-40.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,362);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tp-40-t.jpg" alt="Figure 40" width="114" height="209" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>48. <strong>Cutting the Strap</strong>. 
    When the pocket material is cut out, cut the strap for the center trimming,
      shaping it as shown in Fig. 40, this illustration, in addition to giving
      the details of the work, showing the pocket with strap and flap attached,
      secured to the garment material with the final stitching. Make the lower,
    or wider, end of the flap about one-half as wide as the bottom of the pocket
    and its top about one-third as wide as the top of the pocket; also, make
    it a generous inch longer than the pocket itself. After the strap material
    is cut out, line it with light-weight silk of a harmonizing color; or if
    the garment on which the pocket is to appear is trimmed in another color
    or with plaid, line the strap with it.</p>
  <p>49. <strong>Making the Strap</strong>.&#8212;To make the strap, place the
    right sides of the material and the lining together and stitch along each
    side, using a &frac14;-inch seam and stitching outside the pattern line of the
    strap, so that when it is turned it will not appear narrower than the width
    originally intended. Stitch the sides only, leaving the ends open so that
    the strap can be turned right side out. When the stitched strap is turned,
    press it carefully from the wrong side. In lining the strap, make sure that
    the lining is a trifle narrower than the strap material; that is,
    do
    not allow
    the edge
    of
    the lining 
    to extend beyond the material. When the strap is finished and 
    the stitching is added to the right side, it should appear as at <em>a</em>,
    Fig. 40.</p>
  <p>50. <strong>Making
    the Overlap</strong>.&#8212;With the strap thus prepared, proceed to make
    the overlap, as at <em>b</em>, Fig. 40. Cut the material for the overlap one-half
    as long as the pocket and the same in width. Line it with the same material
    as the strap is lined, and finish it in much the same manner as the flap
    of a flap pocket is finished. Stitch carefully all around the edges, making
    a narrow seam; then turn the flap right side out and stitch it, as at <em>c</em>.
    One or two rows of stitching may be used, depending on the stitching of the
    garment with which it is used.</p>
  <p> 51. <strong>Putting the Pocket Pieces Together</strong>.&#8212;With this
    done place the right side of the flap to the wrong side of the pocket, and
    stitch a good &frac34; inch
    from the edge, as at <em>d</em>. Then turn the seam of the flap down on the
    pocket and stitch, as at <em>e</em>. Next, overcast the edge, as at <em>f</em>, and
    be very careful that the ends <em>g</em> and<em> h</em> do not extend beyond the pocket portion.</p>
  <p> Now pin the strap to the lower side of the pocket, so that it can be stitched
    in position in the manner shown in Fig. 40.</p>
  <p> 52. <strong>Applying the Pocket</strong>.&#8212;Baste the pocket in position on the garment
    and stitch all around its outer edges, using stitching that 
    comes close to the edge or corresponds with the stitching on the garment.
    If the stitching comes very close to the edge, be extremely careful not to
    let it run off the edge. Particular pains must be taken when stitching very
    close to the edge of a thick surface, because the presser foot of the sewing
    machine in such cases has a tendency to drop off, especially in turning corners.</p>
  <p> If the stitching is added directly on the edge, turn the pocket wrong side
    out and trim away the material of the seam up close to the stitching, being
    careful, of course, to hold the seam away in trimming, so as not to clip
    the material. When the pocket is 
    stitched in position, remove the bastings and press it carefully.</p>
  <p> 53. <strong>Finishing the Pocket</strong>.&#8212;Lift up the strap and secure it underneath
    the flap, as shown in Fig. 39. This may be done with slip-stitches, so that
    the thread will not show on either the right or the Wrong side of the pocket.
    If a button is used, as in Fig. 39, rather than take stitches from the underneath
    side, slip the fingers underneath the strap and the flap and sew the button
    on, bringing the thread through the strap and the flap and thus holding
    these two parts together with the button.</p>
  <p> In finishing off patch pockets, turn the garment so that it is wrong side
    up and take a few catch-stitches across the ends of the pocket. These stitches
    will keep it from pulling loose or tearing at the upper edge, as they serve
    to strengthen both the pocket edge and the garment. If such a pocket is to
    be used a great deal, as, for instance, in children's school or play coats,
    it is advisable to put a stay strip at the back of the pocket, because such
    a strip prevents the pocket from tearing out. This strip should be of the
    same material as that used for binding the seams of the garment. It should
    be cut lengthwise and carefully slip-stitched to the material from the wrong
    side, so that the stitches will not be visible from the right side.</p>
  <h5 class="clear"> <a name="plaited" id="plaited"></a>BOX-PLAITED PATCH POCKET</h5>
  <p> <em><a href="illust/tp-41.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,625);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tp-41-t.jpg" alt="Figure 41" width="202" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>54. The box-plaited
    patch pocket, which is shown in Fig. 41, is similar to the patch pocket just
    described. The material for it is cut in much the
    same
    manner, except that 2&frac12; inches is allowed in the center for the plait.</p>
  <p class="clear"> <em><a href="illust/tp-42.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',448,418);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tp-42-t.jpg" alt="Figure 42" width="186" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>55. <strong>Making the Plait and Pocket</strong>.&#8212;The plait is brought together and
    basted, and then the edges are opened out smooth and basted carefully, as
    shown in Fig. 42. If the material is very firm, it is not necessary to stitch
    the plait before pressing it flat. It is 
    customary to leave the plait open, so as to give more freedom in the pocket.
    However, if the material is wiry or not firm in weave, the best plan is to
    stitch the plait and then press it so that it will be true and even and will
    hold its shape well.</p>
  <p class="clear"> <em><a href="illust/tp-43.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',425,401);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tp-43-t.jpg" alt="Figure 43" width="188" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Then turn the outer edge of the pocket and baste, as at <em>a</em>, Fig. 43, and
    bind the upper edge of the pocket with a bias strip of lining, as at <em>b</em>.</p>
  <p class="clear"> <em><a href="illust/tp-44.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,516);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tp-44-t.jpg" alt="Figure 44" width="170" height="207" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>56. <strong>Making the Strap</strong>.&#8212;The strap, which finishes
    the top of the pocket, is cut crosswise of the material. It should be from
    1&frac14; to 1&frac34; inches wide
    and extend just beyond the edges, as shown at <em>a</em>, Fig. 44. Line the
    strap with silk of a color to match the pocket, and stitch the strap in the
    manner
    shown in the illustration or in a way that harmonizes with the other stitchings.</p>
  <p class="clear"> 57. <strong>Completing the Pocket</strong>.&#8212;With the strap made,
    sew the upper edge of the pocket to the strap, as at <em>b</em>. Next, pin
    the pocket in position on the garment. Lift the strap, as at <em>c</em>,
    and stitch the pocket all the way around on its outer edge, stitching to
    the box plait on each side,
    but as a rule
    not across it. In this case, the plait is left so that it may be securely
    slip-stitched from the wrong side. Then stay the ends of the pocket from
    the wrong side, using either a stay strip or slip-stitches. Press the strap
    and
    the pocket so that they will
    lie flat on the garment.</p>
  <p> If desired, a button may be added to each end of the strap so as to make
    the pocket more attractive; or if corded loops are used in trimming the garment,
    a little cord may be made to extend down from the button and be secured in
    place with a button.</p>

In Fig. 45 are illustrated several additional styles of patch pockets.
    Such pockets, as will be noticed, may be made in different shapes, as well
    as with different styles of straps, flaps, and other trimmings. However,
    as is true of the other pockets, patch pockets must always harmonize with
    the garment on which they are used, as a close study of the illustration
    will indicate.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"> <a name="bound" id="bound"></a>BOUND POCKETS</h3>
  <p class="clear"> <em><a href="illust/tp-46.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',418,694);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tp-46-t.jpg" alt="Figure 46" width="220" height="130" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>59. In Fig. 46 is shown the type of pocket known as the <strong>bound pocket</strong>. This
    kind of tailored pocket, which is not unlike a regular slit, or welt, pocket,
    derives its name from the fact that the edges of the opening are bound, usually
    with braid. When garments trimmed with braid are in vogue, this style of
    tailored pocket is in 
    great demand, but, of course, it would rarely, if ever, be used on garments
    that are not so trimmed.</p>
  <p> For binding the pocket edges, braid that is &frac34; inch wide is usually 
    satisfactory, although for broadcloth suits or suits of fine, firm material,
    narrower braid of fine weave is sometimes employed. Military braid is possibly    the most desirable of all braids for tailored work, because it is wieldy;
    that is, it may be stretched or shrunk to fit shaped 
    edges and curves and yet is firm enough to give a satisfactory finish.</p>
  <p class="clear"> <a name="boundopen" id="boundopen"></a><em><a href="illust/tp-47.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',445,771);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tp-47-t.jpg" alt="Figure 47" width="220" height="125" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>60. <strong>Making the Pocket Opening</strong>.&#8212;In
    making a bound pocket, it is necessary first, as in making other pockets,
    to determine its position and the width
    that the pocket opening is to be. With these points known, indicate the width
    of the pocket opening on the material, as shown by the chalk marks a and
    <em>b</em>, Fig. 47, and then at right angles to these lines draw lines<em> c</em> and <em>d</em>,
    placing them so that the distance between them is 1/8 inch less than the
    width of the
    braid, or equal to the width that the bound portions are to be, usually &frac12;
    to &frac34; inch, as the braid on each bound edge shows from &frac14; to 
    3/8 inch. With these points marked, stay the wrong side of the pocket with
    a stay strip, as for the welt pocket.</p>
  <p> Next, cut two pieces of braid, each 2 inches longer than the pocket, and
    apply 
    them to the pocket with small running-stitches, as shown at <em>e</em> and <em>f</em>, taking
    care to keep the outside edges of the braid exactly on the chalk line. When
    the braid is thus secured to the material, form the pocket opening by slashing
    the material exactly in the 
    center of the space between the strips of braid and clipping to the corners
    in diagonal lines, as in the welt pocket, and as shown at <em>g</em>. In clipping
    these diagonal lines, be extremely careful not to clip the braid. With the
    opening cut, slip the braid of the upper edge through the opening to the
    wrong side and baste it, as at <em>h</em>.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illust/tp-48.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,591);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tp-48-t.jpg" alt="Figure 48" width="190" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em> <a name="applypiecese" id="applypiecese"></a>61. <strong>Making and Applying
      the Pouch Pieces</strong>.&#8212;Cut two pieces of lining
    for the pouch portion of the pocket, making these pieces 
    as wide as the braid is long and as deep as the pocket is to be and shaping
    them at the top to conform to the outline of the pocket opening. In this
    case, as the opening is straight, no difficulty will be encountered, but
    when it is crescent-shaped or shaped as in Fig. 25, as is sometimes the case,
    much care has to be taken in shaping the upper edge of the pouch portion
    to make it exact. With the 
    upper edge and the sides of these pieces shaped, shape the lower edge as
    in Fig. 48.</p>
  <p> Next, turn the garment wrong side up and place one of these pouch portions
    so that its upper edge is even with the slashed edge, as at <em>a</em>, and
    baste it in position. Then bring the free edge of the braid of the lower
    portion
    over to the wrong side and secure it in position with basting. Next, turn
    the garment right side up and baste the two folded edges of the braid, or
    welts, together, as in making the welt pocket, exercising care to keep the
    fold even and in line with the weave of the braid.</p>
  <p> Now turn under the triangular piece at each end of the opening and fasten
    it neatly and securely on the wrong side. Next, stitch along the lower edge
    of the braid, as at <em>a</em>, Fig. 46, so that the stitching on the wrong side will
    appear as at <em>b</em>, Fig. 48. This stitching serves to hold the pocket pouch in
    place. If the braid is very wide and extends far below the stitching line
    <em>b</em>, whip the edge down so as to hold it well in place.</p>
  <p> Next, stitch a piece of the garment material to the upper edge of the remaining
    pouch portion, as in making the welt pocket. Then place the side that has
    the material attached directly over the opening, baste the upper edge to
    the braid, and then from the right side stitch the upper edge in the same
    way as the lower edge was stitched.</p>

      Pocket</strong>.&#8212;Turn the wrong side up and stitch the sides
    and the lower end of the pouch portions together, and pull all threads through
    to the wrong side and fasten them in place. Finally, stay the ends of the
    pocket on the wrong side. The ends on the right side may be left plain, as
    the illustration shows, or finished with arrowheads.</p>

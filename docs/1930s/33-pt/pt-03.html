<h3>    <a name="tailored" id="tailored"></a>TAILORED BUTTONHOLES </h3>
<h5><a name="types" id="types"></a>CHARACTERISTICS AND TYPES</h5>
<p> 1. A <strong>buttonhole</strong> is a slit in a garment made to receive a
  button. A tailored buttonhole, which is one that is used in tailored garments,
  differs from
    a plain buttonhole in several ways, although it is intended for the same
    simple purpose. In the first place, it is generally larger, and as it is
    subject to greater strain it must be made firmer, thus calling for heavier
    thread. Such a buttonhole does not shape itself around the button when used
    as a fastening, so it must have an eyelet at the front end to provide a
    resting place for the shank of the button or for the thread that holds the
    button in place on the garment and to permit the buttonhole to come down
    smooth ' on the button, a really essential feature. In addition, the tailored
    buttonhole must almost invariably have a bar at the end opposite the eyelet
to give it strength and to present a substantial appearance.</p>
<p> 2. Above all, tailored buttonholes must be neatly and correctly made. The
    tailored garment that is perfect in every other particular will have an amateurish
    appearance if its buttonholes are poorly cut and improperly worked. Tailors
    and other persons in the trade take great pride in the buttonholes they make,
    and many of them judge the skill of another by the buttonholes alone. One
    way, and sometimes the only way, of determining whether a suit is factory-or
    custom-made is by observing the manner in which the buttonholes are made,
    that is, whether they are hand-done. It should therefore be the aim of every
    woman who desires garments that
    are above the ordinary, to give particular attention to the tailored buttonholes
she works in them.</p>
<p> 3. <strong>Position and Types of Buttonholes</strong>.&#8212;Tailored buttonholes are generally
    cut so as to be horizontal&#8212;that is, perpendicular to the edge of a
    garment&#8212;and in rare cases they are placed so as to be diagonal, or
    slanting. Seldom, if ever, are they made vertical, that is, parallel with
    the edge of a garment, because such buttonholes do not hold the buttons so
    well as do the others and they are not in harmony with the strictly tailored
lines of a tailored garment.</p>
<p> Although there is only one true tailored buttonhole, namely, that which is
    worked with buttonhole twist and buttonhole-stitches, certain others are
    classed as tailored buttonholes, because they are often placed on tailored
    garments. These are known as the <em>simulated buttonhole</em>, which consists simply
    of stitches made on the material for trimming purposes in imitation of a
    buttonhole, no slit being used; the <em>material-bound buttonhole</em>, that is, the
    one that has the cut edges bound with material; and the <em>braid-bound buttonhole</em>,
which has the cut edges bound with braid, usually military braid.</p>
<p> 4. <strong>Making Perfect Buttonholes</strong>.&#8212;The making of perfect buttonholes demands
    practice and the use of proper tools and materials. The woman unaccustomed
    to making buttonholes will do well to practice until she is able to make
    perfectly uniform stitches, both as to depth and distance apart, and has
    mastered the art, for it is indeed an art, of cutting, basting, stitching,
overcasting, stranding, and working a perfect buttonhole.</p>
<p> The tools and materials required for the making of buttonholes, as well as
    the various steps that are necessary for perfect workmanship, are taken up
    in detail in this Chapter. After the woman has had sufficient practice and
    has acquired a knowledge of the steps and tools and materials, she need have
    no hesitancy in undertaking the making of any tailored buttonhole. In fact,
    she will be inclined to look forward to the time of cutting and working buttonholes,
    as, for instance, in a coat that has been painstakingly done, as not only
    an important event, but one that will not be enjoyed unless full preparation
    has been made beforehand for every detail of the work and each step and tool
    is fully understood. But as hand-worked buttonholes take time, they should
    be used chiefly on good materials, concealed fasteners being employed on
cheap materials.</p>
<h5> <a name="tools" id="tools"></a>BUTTONHOLE TOOLS AND MATERIALS</h5>
<p class="clear"><a href="illust/tb-01.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',517,1281);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tb-01-t.jpg" alt="Figure 1" width="220" height="103" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a> <a name="cutters" id="cutters"></a>5. <strong>Buttonhole Cutters</strong>.&#8212;A pair of buttonhole cutters, an example of
    which is shown in Fig. 1, is an invaluable tool for cutting tailored buttonholes.
    Such a tool is constructed so as to cut slits and eyelets with one operation,
    as well as ordinary slits, such as are made with a pair of buttonhole scissors,
    thus insuring buttonholes that are absolutely uniform. The initial cost of
    such a tool is rather high, but in a shop or in other places where many tailored
    buttonholes must be made it works a great economy because it cuts buttonholes
quickly and accurately.</p>
<p> At first glance, a buttonhole cutter may seem like a mysterious device for
    the cutting of so commonplace a thing as a buttonhole;
    but it is really very simple when all its parts are understood. As will be
    observed, there is on one side a knife, or cutting blade, <em>a</em>, directly
    behind which is an eyelet punch <em>e</em>, and on the other side a base <em>b</em>,
    against which the knife and punch are pressed in cutting. This base is cylindrical
    and
    is made so that it can be turned and fastened in place. This cylindrical
    base usually has ten irregular sections, as at <em>c</em> and <em>d</em>,
    and it is the length and the position of each of these sections that control
    the length of the
    buttonhole and permit buttonholes to be cut with or without eyelets. At <em>f</em>  is
    a guide bar that serves to regulate the distance of the eyelet from the edge
    of the garment in cutting, a thumbscrew <em>g</em> being used to fasten this
    bar in place. At h is another thumbscrew, which fastens the base of the cutter
    in place when it is turned to a position that will give the length and kind
of buttonhole desired.</p>
<p> In cutting a buttonhole with a tool of this kind, place the material over
    the cylindrical base and push the guide bar, properly
    adjusted, up against the edge of the garment; then bring the blade and punch
    down over the material resting on the base by pressing the handles of the
    cutter together. With a little experimenting, no difficulty will be encountered
    in adjusting and using the cutter for any length of buttonhole ranging from
    &frac12; inch to 1&frac14; inches. Before using the cutter on a garment,
    it is advisable to prepare a strip of three thicknesses of material arid
    cut a number of
    buttonholes, spacing them for a certain length and a certain distance apart
and adjusting the cutter so as to cut both the eyelet and the straight buttonhole.</p>
<p> <a name="scissors" id="scissors"></a>6. <strong>Buttonhole Scissors and Punches</strong>.&#8212;Buttonhole scissors may be used
    for cutting tailored buttonholes, but they must be very sharp and, after
    making the slit, it is necessary to form the eyelet with a punch. An ordinary
    eyelet punch, or awl, such as is used to punch holes in leather, is satisfactory
    for making the rounded end. In cutting a buttonhole with buttonhole scissors
    and an eyelet punch, take particular pains to have the eyelet directly in
    line with the buttonhole slit. If it is a fraction of an inch too high or
too low, it will spoil the shape of the finished buttonhole.</p>
<p> <a name="gimp" id="gimp"></a>7. <strong>Buttonhole Gimp</strong>.&#8212;As tailored buttonholes are subject
  to considerable wear, they must necessarily be made durable. For this reason,
  as well as
    to give a firm finished edge to a buttonhole, the edge should be stranded
    with what is known as buttonhole gimp. Buttonhole gimp, which is made in
    black and white, consists of very firm, small cotton cord closely wound with
    silk thread, being similar in appearance to fine, silk-covered hat wire.
    It is a scant 1/16 inch in diameter and very firm. It may be purchased
at nearly all notion counters and tailors' supply houses.</p>
<p> <a name="strandingthread" id="strandingthread"></a>8. <strong>Stranding Thread</strong>.&#8212;If
  it is not convenient to use buttonhole gimp or if the material in which the
  buttonhole is to be worked is not very heavy,
    a stranding thread, which may be made of heavy linen thread, will serve the
    purpose very well; in fact, some persons consider it to be even better than
    gimp, because it is softer and thus prevents the working thread from wearing
through readily.</p>
<p> 9. To make stranding thread, thread a needle with a convenient length of
    linen thread, say 1&frac12; to 1&frac34; yards, bringing the ends together
    just as if making ready to sew with a double thread. Then wax this thread
    with beeswax,
  which
    may be purchased at any notion
    counter, carrying the thread over the beeswax quickly and bringing it down
    carefully in order to wax the thread the full length and yet not have too
    much wax at any one place. The beeswax serves to hold the strands of the
    thread together and also to make it firmer, so that it will not press down
    too closely on the material when the working thread, or buttonhole twist,
used in making the buttonhole is put over it.</p>
<p> After the thread is waxed, finish making the stranding thread by twisting
    the strands together in the following manner: Hold the needle in the left
    hand between the thumb and the forefinger, letting the thread fall at the
    lower edge of the inside of the hand. Then, with the inside of the right
    hand, roll the thread between the hands, bringing it around toward the thumb
    of the left hand. After the twisting is begun, run the hand down the thread
    over the wrist for 4 or 5 inches. Repeat this operation over the same length
    of thread two or three more times in order to twist and smooth the strands
well.</p>
<p>Place the portion of the thread just twisted around the little finger of
    the left hand, bringing it up over the thumb and forefinger, and allow the
    loose end of the thread to take the same position over the lower part of
    the hand as at first. Then repeat the twisting operation; that is, twist
    another section of the thread by bringing the hand over it and rolling it
    between the hands. Do this two or three times to keep the thread smooth.
    Then bring the thread up around the little finger and then around the thumb,
    as before, forming a figure 8 out of it, and continue to roll and twist the
strands of thread until the entire length is twisted.</p>
<p> By twisting the thread in this manner, an even twist is insured and the two
    threads will hold as one thread; whereas, if they are not rolled and twisted
    from the needle, kinks will come when the thread is in use, causing inconvenience
    and probably imperfect work. This amount of stranding thread is usually sufficient
    for several buttonholes, as each buttonhole requires about f yard. Also,
    by preparing it all at one time in this manner, a more even thread is secured
and time is saved.</p>
<p> <a name="thread" id="thread"></a>10. <strong>Buttonhole Thread</strong>.&#8212;Buttonhole thread, or twist,
  as it is generally called, is used for working tailored buttonholes, and to
  distinguish it from
    the stranding thread it is frequently referred to as the <em>working thread</em>.
    Buttonhole twist is usually purchased in
    10-yard spools, but it is also sold in large spools at tailor shops or in
    tailors' supply houses. In the large spools, however, it may be had in only
    a few colors; namely, black, white, dark gray, and brown. For home use, it
    is advisable to buy the twist in small quantities; in fact, no one would
    be justified in buying large spools unless there is work to require a large
    amount of one color of twist. For shop work, however, it is much more economical
and convenient to obtain the twist in large quantities.</p>
<p> 11. The twist, sizes A to D, comes in black only, while in sizes D, E, and
    F, it may be had in a variety of colors. Size A twist is the finest, and
size F, the heaviest and coarsest.</p>
<p> In purchasing buttonhole twist, it is advisable to lay the thread out on
    a sample of the material and then to make sure that it is two shades darker.
    Although sewing silk should be purchased one shade darker than the material
    with which it is to be used, buttonhole twist should be two shades darker
    because the stitches embed themselves in the material securely and they will
    not entirely conceal the interlining unless they are two shades darker. Some
    materials in the medium and darker shades, especially blue, will be found
difficult to match, so buttonholes in them are worked in black.</p>
<p> 12. As it is difficult to join the thread used in working buttonholes, the
    best plan is to use a length of thread that is sufficient to work the entire
    buttonhole. If this is done, the purl will be in no danger of appearing broken
    or irregular in any place. A small tailored buttonhole may be worked with
    &frac34; yard of twist, but buttonholes of average size take a full yard length.
    If a thread breaks and a new thread must be used in the process of making
    the buttonhole, fasten off the first thread well and secure the new one,
    beginning a stitch back of the first thread and bringing the stitch of the
    second thread up through the last purl of the first thread, so as to make
the joining as nearly invisible as possible.</p>
<p> <a name="thimble" id="thimble"></a>13. <strong>Thimble</strong>.&#8212;In
  making tailored buttonholes, the thimble finger and the forefinger come very
  close to the buttonhole and the thread. Therefore,
    as the thread is of silk, it is very essential to have a thimble that is
    smooth, that is, without any rough places. If the thread catches on the thimble
even once, it will become rough and possibly spoil the effect of the buttonhole.</p>
<p> 14. <strong>Needles</strong>.&#8212;Needles of the best quality should be
  used in buttonhole work. A medium-heavy needle is necessary for the stranding
  thread, and one
    that has an eye just large enough to carry the working thread should be used
    for it. A needle that is too large
    makes a close placing of the stitches difficult and also weakens the edges.
    As a general rule, a No. 6 short needle is the proper size for correct working,
    the term <em>short</em> meaning a needle about 1 &frac12; inches long. Such a
    needle permits all the thread to be used and also facilitates the looping
    of the
    thread
around the needle.</p>
<p> <a name="stilleto" id="stilleto"></a>15. <strong>Stiletto</strong>.&#8212;For shaping the eyelet after a buttonhole
  is worked, a stiletto is a very satisfactory tool. Men tailors generally prefer
  the
    awl previously mentioned, possibly because they are accustomed to using it.
However, the stiletto from the embroidery basket will answer very well.</p>
<h5 class="clear"> <a name="making" id="making"></a>MAKING A TAILORED BUTTONHOLE</h5>
<p><a href="illust/tb-02.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,295);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tb-02-t.jpg" alt="Figure 2" width="92" height="211" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>16. In Fig. 2 is shown in detail the making of a tailored buttonhole, including
    each step and the operation in the development &#8212; the marking, basting,
    stitching, cutting,
    stranding, working, and final basting and shaping&#8212;as well as the position
    of the buttonhole from the edge, and the interlining, which serves as a foundation.
    This illustration should be studied in connection with the following directions
so that a correct knowledge of how to make tailored buttonholes may be obtained.</p>
<p> <a name="foundation" id="foundation"></a>17. <strong>Foundation for Tailored Buttonholes</strong>.&#8212;Tailored buttonholes are almost
    invariably worked through three thicknesses of material, two of them consisting
    of the material of which the garment is made and the other of the interlining
    between the two thicknesses, as is indicated at <em>a</em>, Fig. 2. The purpose of
    the interlining is to stay the edges of the garment and thus prevent it from
    stretching, and to provide a firm foundation for the buttonholes. Especially
    is this interlining necessary in woolens, as the threads of such materials
do not hold together so well as do those of linen and cotton fabrics.</p>
<p> In garments made of woolen materials, the interlining should be a soft, pliable
    linen canvas that has been carefully shrunk. A firm grade of unbleached muslin
    is also desirable for such a purpose. For the interlining of silk garments,
    silk of lighter weight than the garment material itself, sateen, or soft
    cambric is suitable, and for linen garments, butcher's linen, soft cambric,
    or muslin is desirable. In dark-colored garments, it is advisable to use
    a dark-colored interlining, and in light-colored ones the interlining should
be of a lighter color than the garment material.</p>
<p> 18. If buttonholes are to be worked in places on a garment where there is
    no interlining, then it is necessary to baste a piece of interlining between
    the two thicknesses of the material at these places. Such interlining should
    be 1 inch wide and &frac12; inch longer than the buttonholes themselves. All three
    thicknesses of material should be basted very smoothly together at each place
    where a buttonhole is to be made, and then carefully pressed with a damp
cloth on the wrong side of the fabric.</p>
<p> If buttonholes are to be worked in places where an interlining cannot be
    inserted between two thicknesses of material, a piece of lining may be put
    underneath. In such a case, the lining must be of a color that is very similar
    to the material itself, and after the buttonhole is worked the edges of the
    lining material must be carefully trimmed away up to the outside edge of
the buttonhole-stitches.</p>
<p> 19. For practice in the making of tailored buttonholes, it will be necessary
    to prepare a strip on which to work the buttonholes, using for this purpose
    a piece of woolen material, 8 inches long and 8 or 10 inches wide, and a
    piece of canvas or firm muslin, as shown at <em>a</em>, of the same length
    as the woolen piece and half as wide. So that this practice strip will be
    the same
    as the edge of a garment,
    fold it lengthwise through the center and place the canvas between the two
    thicknesses. Then baste the outer edge carefully and stitch f inch from the
    edge, as shown at <em>b</em>. With such a strip made, the marking and making of tailored
buttonholes may be begun.</p>
<p> <a name="position" id="position"></a>20. <strong>Position and Size of Buttonholes</strong>.&#8212;As buttonholes
  must be properly spaced and marked before they are cut, locating their position
  and determining
    their size are the first points to consider after the outside edge of the
    garment is stitched or basted, as at b. Tailored buttonholes should be spaced
    uniform distances apart, and the distance between the eye of each one and
    the finished edge of the garment must not vary in the least. When used as
a closing, the buttonholes should be at least 1/8 inch from the stitching.</p>
<p> Just how far apart the buttonholes should be depends on the fashions of the
    day, for they regulate the size and number of buttons to be used, and these,
    in turn, regulate the buttonholes. Sometimes buttons are placed very close
    together almost the entire length of the coat front, and at other times only
    one, two, or possibly three are used. When the size and the number of buttons
    are determined, the positions for the top and bottom buttonholes must be
    marked accordingly, and then the distance between these two points equally
    divided into the required number of spaces. As a rule, the larger the buttons,
    the fewer of them will be used and the greater will be the space between
    them, the buttonholes, of course, being spaced to correspond. The size of
    the buttonhole is likewise governed by the size and the thickness of the
    buttons. The length of the buttonhole should be equal to the diameter of
the button, plus 1/8 to 3/8 inch, depending on its thickness.</p>
<p> If buttonholes must be placed so as to be diagonal with the edge of the garment,
    they should be carefully stayed in order to give them the required strength.
    Such buttonholes must be so marked that all will be in a true line and each
one will be parallel with the other.</p>
<p> <a name="marking" id="marking"></a>21. <strong>Marking Buttonholes</strong>.&#8212;After deciding on the size
  and position of the buttonholes and the number there are to be, the next step
  consists in
    marking them on the material, as is shown at c, Fig. 2. The marking should
    be done with tailors' chalk having a sharp edge, so as to make distinct lines,
    and a perfectly straight edge, should be used as a guide in marking. In marking
    for buttonholes, make the horizontal lines first, and in order to space them
    accurately, procure a piece of cardboard equal in width to the distance
    they are to be apart. Place this cardboard so that the first two buttonholes
    can be marked by running the chalk along the top and the bottom edge; then
    place the cardboard so that its top edge is along the second buttonhole mark,
    and mark for the third one. Continue the work in this way until all the buttonholes
are marked.</p>
<p> After the horizontal lines are drawn, make the vertical lines that indicate
    the width that each buttonhole is to be, as at<em> d</em> and <em>e</em>. To aid in this work,
    use a piece, or strip, of cardboard that is exactly as wide as each buttonhole
    is to be. Place this cardboard parallel with the edge of the garment or with
    the warp threads of the material and make a chalk mark on each side, thus
    insuring uniformity. The lines for the buttonholes should be of about the
same proportion as those shown in the illustration.</p>
<p> 22. <strong>Basting Preparatory to Stitching</strong>.&#8212;The next step
  in making a tailored buttonhole is to baste around the chalk lines in the manner
  shown at <em>f</em> and
    <em>g</em>; that is, with bastings that are a scant J inch long and are placed diagonally
    with the chalk marks that indicate the width that the buttonholes are to
    be. The purpose of such basting-stitches is to hold the material so that
it will not pull or slip out of place.</p>
<p> <a name="outlining" id="outlining"></a>33. <strong>Outlining Buttonholes</strong>.&#8212;After the marking and the
  diagonal basting have been completed, stitch through all thicknesses of the
  material with
    the sewing machine 1/16 inch on each side of the horizontal chalk line, as
    shown at <em>h</em> and <em>i</em>, and around the outside end of the line
    in the form of a circle, as at <em>j</em>. This stitching serves to outline
    the buttonhole, to secure the material so that the edges of the three thicknesses
    will remain
    together
    firmly after the buttonhole slit is cut, and to prevent the fabric from slipping
    when the buttonholes are being worked. Care should be taken to form the circle
    over the chalk marks as indicated, so that the center of the eyelet, when
    the buttonhole is cut and worked, will be in exact line with the finished
    buttonhole. Begin the stitching and end it at the back, or inside, end of
    the buttonhole, and after it is completed bring the thread ends through to
    the wrong side, thread a sewing needle with them, and take a couple of back-stitches
    to make sure that they will hold securely. Then cut away the surplus thread
up close to the machine stitches.</p>
<p> <a name="cutting" id="cutting"></a>34. <strong>Cutting Buttonholes</strong>.&#8212;After the machine stitching
  has been done on all the buttonholes that are to be made, they are ready
    to be cut. It is not advisable to cut all the buttonholes before beginning
    to work them; rather, the best plan is to cut one and work it and then proceed
    with the next, and so on. In this way, the danger of their fraying out while
    one is being worked will be overcome. If the buttonhole cutter is to be used
    for this work, place the punch of the cutter directly in the center of the
    stitched circle prepared for the eyelet, and the blade in line with the mark;
    also, be sure that the cutter is adjusted for the correct width of buttonhole.
    If buttonhole scissors are to be used, place the notch of the scissors just
inside the stitched circle and cut an the marked line.</p>
<p> In the absence of both buttonhole cutter and buttonhole scissors, a pair
    of ordinary scissors may be used. With such scissors, first cut a slit by
    inserting the point of one blade in the center of the circle and then cut
    through all thicknesses exactly on the mark, or midway between the stitching.
    The scissors used for cutting should be sharp, so that the buttonhole slit
may be cut with one movement of them.</p>
<p> After the slit is cut with either buttonhole or ordinary scissors, the eyelet
    must be formed. This may be done with an eyelet punch; but if there is none
    at hand punch a hole in the space provided with a stiletto or an awl, putting
    it in from the right side and then from the wrong side. Then trim away the
    surplus material up to within the same distance of the stitched edge of the
eyelet space as the buttonhole slit is from the edges of the rows of stitching.</p>
<p> <a name="securing" id="securing"></a>35. <strong>Securing the Edges of Buttonhole
    Slits</strong>.&#8212;The next step, after cutting
    the buttonhole slit, is to secure the edges so as to keep them from raveling
    and to make them very firm. This may be done by overcasting them with very
    close, uniform stitches, taking them back almost to the machine stitching
    and overcasting with strong cotton thread. In some custom-tailor shops, in
    addition to overcasting, the trimmed edges are secured by waxing. On gray
    or novelty goods, beeswax is used, and on dark-blue or black materials,
    harnessmakers' wax is employed. To apply either wax, heat the blade of an
    ordinary steel kitchen knife and rub it over the wax; then quickly insert
    it in the buttonhole slit and rub it back and forth a few times so that part
    of the wax will adhere to the slit edges. The wax keeps these edges from
    raveling and also holds the material together, making it possible to work
the buttonholes more rapidly than if the edges are just overcast.</p>
<p> <a name="stranding" id="stranding"></a>26. <strong>Stranding Buttonholes</strong>.&#8212;After a buttonhole is cut and before it
    is worked, it must be stranded with gimp or with stranding thread, as has
    already been mentioned. The method of stranding is the same, whether gimp
    or stranding thread is used, but whether one or the other should be used
    depends somewhat on the material, gimp being more suitable for heavy materials
    and stranding thread, for light-weight fabrics. Stranding should be done
in the following manner:</p>
<p> Thread a needle with a length of the gimp or the stranding thread and tie
    a knot in one end of it. Then, at a point about &frac14; inch beyond the back
  end of the buttonhole and in a direct line with the upper edge of the buttonhole
    slit, insert the needle through the three thicknesses of the material from,
    the right side, pulling it through so that the knot will come as at <em>k</em>,
    Fig. 2. With the finished edge of the garment&#8212;that is, the eyelet of
    the buttonhole&#8212;toward you, bring the thread out at the left end of
    the buttonhole, just below the stitching, and carry it across to. the eyelet
    end. Then secure it in this position until half the buttonhole is worked,
    pushing the needle firmly into the material and wrapping the gimp or the
    stranding thread around it, as at <em>l</em>. When the upper half of the
    buttonhole is worked, bring the gimp or the stranding thread along the lower
    half and
    fasten it in the same way at the back end of the buttonhole, as shown at
    <em>m</em>. After the buttonhole is completed, bring the gimp or stranding thread
    straight through the material precisely at the back end of the buttonhole
    and to the under side; then cut it off close to the material. Likewise, cut
    off the knotted end and pull the gimp or the stranding thread away from the
right side.</p>
<p> In very firm materials, where the hole made by putting the needle in, as
    at <em>k</em>, might show in the material, it is better to pin the gimp or stranding
    thread right at the end of the buttonhole, rather than to take a stitch.
    In this way, no marks will show, as those made by the pin will be concealed
by the buttonhole-stitches when the buttonhole is finished.</p>
<p> <a name="working" id="working"></a>27. <strong>Working Buttonholes</strong>.&#8212;After a buttonhole is stranded,
  it is ready to be worked. Thread a needle with a strand of buttonhole twist,
  or working
    thread, of the proper length and color. Pull it lightly over beeswax and
    then over the edge of a warm iron, so as to distribute the wax evenly. Then,
    holding the garment so that the outer edge is at the left, fasten the thread
    at the end, on the
    right-hand side and up close to the end of the buttonhole slit, with a tiny
    back-stitch. Hold the buttonhole in this position over the forefinger of
    the left hand, and bring the fastened end of the thread toward the inside
    of the buttonhole. Insert the needle through the slit and bring it up just
    outside of the machine stitching; then bring the two threads as they come
    from the needle around the point under the needle, and draw up the thread
    firm and close to form the stitch. Then insert the needle again and continue
    working to the opposite end of the buttonhole, keeping the nail of the left
    thumb just back of the stitching as a guide in taking the stitches, so as
not to make them too deep in any place.</p>
<p> 28. When the eyelet is reached in working the buttonhole, release the strand
    of gimp or stranding thread at the front end and hold it in position around
    the eyelet while the buttonhole-stitches are taken over it. Arrange the stitches
    at the beginning and ending of the eyelet so as to form corners; that is,
    so that the circle of the eyelet will be as nearly perfect as possible. Turn
    the work gradually and change the direction of each stitch slightly while
    working the eyelet, so that the stitches will radiate from the center. To
    do this, the purl must be crowded and the other end of the stitches placed
    a trifle farther apart and more slanting than they are at the sides of the
    buttonhole. After the eyelet is completed, pull up the stranding thread under
    the working thread, so as to take out any slack that may be in it and to
    insure a true, uniform eyelet edge, securing the stranding thread at the
back end of the buttonhole, as at <em>m</em>.</p>
<p> 29. Next, turn the work so that the other side of the buttonhole will be
    toward you and proceed to work this half of the buttonhole. Just before the
    end is reached, remove the stranding needle at <em>m</em> from the cloth
    and take the stranding thread down through the cloth, precisely at the end
    of the
    buttonhole to the wrong side; then twist it around the end of the finger
and hold it tight until the last buttonhole-stitch is finished.</p>
<p> 30. When the buttonhole-stitches are completed, a bar may be worked at the
    end, if desired. To make such a bar, turn the work so that the back end of
    the buttonhole will be next to you. Then take two or three bar-stitches across
    the end with the working thread, keeping them very close to this end of the
    buttonhole, and cover these stitches with tiny over-and-over stitches. Make
    the
    little over-and-over stitches directly alongside of each other, so that a
    neat, narrow bar will be the result. By putting the eye of the needle instead
    of the point under the bar threads, the work may be done more quickly, as
    the eye of the needle will not catch the thread When the over-and-over stitches
    are completed, fasten the working thread securely on the inside of the material
and cut off the stranding thread.</p>
<p> <a name="pressing" id="pressing"></a>31. <strong>Pressing and Finishing</strong>.&#8212;When a buttonhole is worked it is advisable
    to overcast it with basting thread, as at <em>n</em>, Fig. 2, and to press it well
    on the wrong side, using a press cloth, so that the edge will be smooth and
    the ends of the buttonholes properly shaped. The overcasting-stitches should
    be left in until the garment is entirely completed. In pressing, the eyelet
    of the buttonhole should be rounded out into a perfect circle, as at <em>o</em>, by
means of a stiletto.</p>
<p> <a name="commercial" id="commercial"></a>32. <strong>Commercial Buttonhole Making</strong>.&#8212;The person who acquires skill in
    the making of buttonholes may feel that she possesses an accomplishment of
    which she may well be proud&#8212;one that will mean the saving of money
    or possibly place her in a position to earn money by making tailored buttonholes
    for others. In the large custom-tailoring establishments are employed buttonhole
    makers, that is, persons who make nothing but buttonholes. These persons
    take a garment, for example a coat, that is finished with the exception of
    the lining, and then stitch, overcast, strand, work, and press the buttonholes.
    The price they receive depends on the type of material used in the garment
    and also on the quality of the work done. In estimating charges, the size
of the buttonhole is also considered.</p>
<h5 class="clear"> <a name="simulated" id="simulated"></a>SIMULATED BUTTONHOLES</h5>
<p> <a href="illust/tb-03.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,329);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tb-03-t.jpg" alt="Figure 3" width="103" height="210" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>33. The <strong>simulated buttonhole</strong>, or <em>blind buttonhole</em>,
  as it is sometimes called, is merely an imitation buttonhole. As will be observed
  from Fig. 3, it resembles
    a tailored buttonhole, yet it has no eyelet nor opening. It consists merely
    of single-purl buttonhole-stitches made in two rows and placed in position
    as a trimming where no fastener is needed. Chain-stitches, knot-stitches,
    as well as stem-stitches may be used to work simulated buttonholes, but then
    only one row of stitches placed very close together is worked. The advantage
    of this buttonhole is that it may be quickly worked, and, as the material
    in which it is worked is not cut, no interlining
    is required, nor does it have to be stayed. As this kind of buttonhole is
    used as trimming, colored thread that contrasts with the material is often
used in working it.</p>
<p> 34. The way in which a simulated buttonhole is worked with the single-purl
    buttonhole-stitch is clearly indicated in Fig. 3, the
    various steps being as follows: First mark the position of the buttonhole
    with tailors' chalk in the manner explained for a tailored buttonhole. Then
    proceed to strand or outline the buttonhole with stranding thread or gimp.
    Thread a needle with the stranding thread, tie a knot in the end of the thread,
    and then insert the needle from the right side of the material, so that the
    knot will be placed as at <em>a</em>. Then bring the needle up through the
    material as at<em> b</em>, put it in as at <em>c</em>, and out as at <em>d</em>,
    and then bring it over to <em>e</em>,
    here taking a stitch through the material and then pulling the stranding
    thread through to the wrong side. With the stranding thread thus placed,
    proceed with the making of the buttonhole-stitches. Hold, the work as for
    tailored
    buttonholes, and work over the upper thread and through the material, as
    at <em>f</em>. When this edge of the buttonhole is completed, turn the work
    and make the stitches over the other stranding thread, taking the stitches
    through
    the material, as before, and keeping the purl very close to the adjoining
    side. When this side. is worked, fasten the threads on the wrong side as
    for a tailored buttonhole, trim them off, and press the buttonhole carefully
from the wrong side, when it will appear as at <em>g</em>.</p>
<h5> <a name="bound" id="bound"></a>BOUND BUTTONHOLES</h5>
<p> 35. Buttonholes may be bound with the material of which a garment is made
    or with braid. The material-bound buttonholes, however, are the more important
    of the two, because braid buttonholes are used only when a garment has braid
    applied elsewhere as a trimming. The bound buttonhole, like the tailored
    buttonhole, must be made larger than the plain buttonhole. Seldom, if ever,
    is it made smaller than 1 inch, and to accommodate large buttons it is often
made 2 to 2&frac12; inches wide.</p>
<p class="clear"> <a name="material" id="material"></a>36. <strong>Material-Bound Buttonhole</strong>.&#8212;At <em>a</em>,
  Fig. 4,<a href="illust/tb-05.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',796,661);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tb-05-t.jpg" alt="Figure 5" width="165" height="203" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a> is <a href="illust/tb-04.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',535,413);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tb-04-t.jpg" alt="Figure 4" width="153" height="196" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>shown a buttonhole bound with the material of which the garment
  is made,
  although for this kind
    of buttonhole heavy silk or satin may also be
    thicknesses of material, as in the tailored buttonhole. The under thickness,
    or inside facing, of the material, however, must be turned back out of the
    way, as at <em>a</em>, Fig. 5, until the buttonhole binding is applied. For
    each buttonhole there must also be provided a piece of binding material that
    is 2 &frac12; inches
    wide and of a length that will permit it to extend &frac34; inch on each end of
    the buttonhole opening. This binding may be cut from a straight or a bias
    piece of material. The bias piece is usually preferred, as it is easier to
apply. The procedure in making a material-bound buttonhole is as follows:</p>
<p> 37. First, as directed for marking the position of tailored buttonholes,
    mark the position of the bound buttonholes, and at the same time mark the
    position of the buttonhole on each binding piece, placing the mark so that
    there will be &frac34; inch of material on each side of it and 1 &frac14; inches above
  and below it. Next, baste a binding piece to the upper, or outside, thickness
    of the garment material and the interlining, placing it so that the mark
    for the buttonhole is exactly
    over the buttonhole mark on the material. Use diagonal basting all around
    the buttonhole mark, placing it about &frac14; inch from this mark, as at <em>b</em> and
    <em>c</em>, Fig. 5, so as to hold the thicknesses of material perfectly smooth.
    With this done, machine stitch 1/8 inch on each side of the chalk mark, as
    shown at <em>d</em>, and straight, across the end marks, pulling the ends of the machine
stitches through and tying them securely at the under side.</p>
<p class="clear"> After stitching in this manner, remove the basting thread and cut the slit
    with a pair of sharp scissors. Cut through both the material and the binding
    on the chalk mark between the rows of stitching, beginning 1/8 inch from
  one end and continuing to within 1/8 inch of the other end, and then, from
  each
    end of the slit, make diagonal cuts to the corners. With the opening thus
    cut, turn the binding piece through to the wrong side, as at <em>e</em>,
    and with the fingers press the seam edges at the sides and ends of the slit
    back from
    the opening, or allow one of the seam edges to extend out into the welt if
    the firmness this affords seems necessary. Trim the edges slightly to fit
    the welt and roll the binding out 1/8 inch from the machine stitching, as
    in a welt pocket, so that it will fill up half of the opening and form little
    plaits underneath at the ends on the wrong side, as at <em>c<a href="illust/tb-07.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,372);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tb-07-t.jpg" alt="Figure 7" width="116" height="198" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>, Fig. 6,<em><a href="illust/tb-06.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,589);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tb-06-t.jpg" alt="Figure 6" width="190" height="187" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>  and then baste close to the stitching, as at <em>f</em>, Fig. 5. Next, baste
    across the opposite side and the ends in the same way, and the buttonhole
    will appear as at <em>a</em>,
    Fig. 6. After basting in this
    manner, trim away the surplus binding to within &frac12; inch of the opening and
    then overcast to the interlining, as shown at <em>b</em>. If no interlining is used,
the overcasting is omitted.</p>
<p> Next, remove the basting around the buttonhole, bring the under thickness
    of the material a, Fig. 5, back into position, as in Fig. 7,
    which shows the under side of the garment, and then baste all thicknesses
    together around the buttonhole, as at <em>a</em>. With this done, cut carefully
    from the right side through the under thickness of material between the buttonhole
    edges, as at<em> b</em>, beginning 1/8 inch from one end and continuing to
    within 1/8 inch of the other; then turn to the wrong side and at each end
    of the
    opening
    just cut make short, diagonal cuts to the corners of the buttonhole, as at
    <em>c</em>. Turn the <em>raw</em> edges of the underneath material under1/8
    inch at the sides, as at <em>d</em>, and the ends, and whip the turned edges,
    as at
    <em>e</em>. Then remove the
basting, and the buttonhole on the under side will appear as at <em>f</em>.</p>
<p> When the buttonhole is finished on the under side, overcast its edges from
    the right side, as at <em>b</em>, Fig. 4. Then press the buttonhole under a cloth,
    remove the overcasting-stitches, and the completed buttonhole will appear
on the right side as at <em>a</em>, Fig. 4.</p>
<p class="clear"><em><a href="illust/tb-08.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',333,445);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tb-08-t.jpg" alt="Figure 8" width="200" height="141" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em> <a name="braid" id="braid"></a>38. <strong>Braid-Bound Buttonhole</strong>.&#8212;In
  Fig. 8 is shown a buttonhole bound with braid. For buttonholes like this, use
  silk braid &frac34; inch
    wide, the grade known as military braid being best. Although black braid
    may be used on materials of dark color, the braid should preferably be of
    a color that matches the material of which the garment is made, and for stitching
    sewing silk of a color that exactly matches the color of the braid should
    be employed.
    As in the material-bound buttonhole just described, there should be an interlining
    between the two thicknesses in which braid-bound buttonholes are to be made.
    The procedure in making a braid-
    bound buttonhole is similar to that for a material-bound buttonhole, and
is as follows:</p>
<p class="clear"> <em><a href="illust/tb-09.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,255);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tb-09-t.jpg" alt="Figure 9" width="78" height="210" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>39. To begin, mark the position and length of the buttonholes on the garment,
    and then, to serve as a guide in basting on the braid,
    make another chalk mark &frac14; inch above and another&frac14; inch below each horizontal
    buttonhole mark. Next, turn back the underneath thickness of the material,
    so that it will not be caught in stitching. With the material thus made ready
    for the buttonholes, cut two pieces of braid for one buttonhole, cutting
    each piece 1 inch longer than the buttonhole is to be. It is advisable to
    cut only enough braid at a time for one buttonhole, so that the ends of the
    cut pieces will not become frayed. Baste one edge of each piece close along
    the chalk mark at each side of the center mark, beginning at one end mark
    of the buttonhole, continuing to the other, and letting &frac12; inch of the braid
    extend beyond each end. Next, stitch the braid close along its edges with
    the sewing machine from one end of the buttonhole to the other, as it was
    basted, as shown at <em>a</em>, Fig. 9, and when the stitching is done pull the ends
of the thread through and tie them securely on the under side.</p>
<p> With the braid stitched in place, remove the basting and proceed
  to cut the opening. Cut along the chalk mark, between the braid, to within
    1/8 inch of the ends, and then cut diagonally to the corners
    as indicated at<em> b</em>. Next, turn one piece of the braid over the edge
    of the buttonhole slit, as at <em>c</em>, working it back well over the edge.
    Then baste it firmly to the interlining on the under side, just outside the
    machine
    stitching. Next, bring the other piece of braid through in the same manner
    and baste it in place. With this done, overcast the edges of the braid together,
    as at <em>d</em>. Next, turn the material back at the ends of the buttonhole,
    as at
    <em>e</em>, and, front underneath, back-stitch straight across these ends,
    fastening them securely to the braid; also, whip together the edges of the
    braid that
    extend beyond the ends of the buttonhole, as at<em> f</em>. Next, whip the
    sides and ends of the braid to the interlining, as indicated at <em>g</em>. and then
    carefully
press the buttonhole from the right side under a cloth.</p>
<p> From this stage on, the work is practically the same as that for the material-bound
    buttonhole. Bring the under thickness of material back into position and
    baste all thicknesses together, close around the buttonhole. Turn the work
    to the right side, remove the overcasting, and cut between the edges of the
    buttonhole through the under thickness of material, beginning 1/8 inch from
    one end and extending to within 1/8 inch of the other; then turn to the wrong
    side and from each end of the opening make a diagonal cut to each corner.
    When the cutting of the opening is completed, turn under the triangular points
    at the ends the same as for the right side, whip along the turned edges,
and then remove the basting. Finish the buttonhole by pressing carefully.</p>
<h3> <a name="other" id="other"></a>BUTTONS AND OTHER TRIMMINGS </h3>
<h5><a name="strict" id="strict"></a>BUTTONS FOR STRICTLY TAILORED GARMENTS</h5>
<p> 40. Buttons for strictly tailored garments are of two kinds; those made of
    vegetable ivory, bone, and various compositions, and those covered with material,
    which may be plain or decorated. Many persons fail to appreciate the value
    of suitable buttons, looking at them simply as necessities. Nevertheless,
    it is a fact that the kind of button often proclaims the class to which a
    suit or a coat belongs, because a person who knows the value of buttons that
    are in good taste almost invariably knows to the fullest extent the value
    of good material and correct lines and is sure to combine them. As a strictly
    tailored garment should be dignified in line and of excellent workmanship,
  a knowledge of the right kind of button to use will be of great assistance
  in giving to it just the right finishing touch. The original cost
    of good buttons, that is, those which are not covered, is sometimes considerable,
    but neat dark or light buttons can be used repeatedly on tailored garments
    of dark or light colors, because they seldom break, do not wear out, and
are almost always in vogue on tailored garments.</p>
<p class="clear"> <em><a href="illust/tb-10.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,462);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tb-10-t.jpg" alt="Figure 10" width="147" height="212" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>41. <strong>Types of Buttons</strong>.&#8212;In Fig. 10 are shown two styles of buttons in
different sizes.</p>
<p> The style of button shown in (<em>a</em>) is known as a <em>four-hole button</em>  and is used on men's garments to give them the tailored look. Such
    buttons may also be had with two holes and in innumerable designs. In choosing
    buttons of this kind, it is well to remember that the design must be neat
arid plain to be in keeping with strictly tailored garments.</p>
<p> The style of button shown in (<em>b</em>) is a <em>shank button</em>, called,
  also, by some the <em>women's tailored button</em>, because it was designed
  originally for women's
    garments. This kind of button is to be had in as many sizes and designs as
    the hole buttons, and while either kind is in good taste, the two- and four-hole
buttons seem to have preference even for women's garments.</p>
<p> Of the three sizes of buttons,shown in full size in Fig. 10, that at a is
    used for trimming cuffs and belts; that at <em>b</em>, when buttons are to be placed
    close together on the front of a coat or a skirt; and that at <em>c</em>, when three
to five buttons are to be used for the front of a coat or a skirt.</p>
<p class="clear"> <em><a href="illust/tb-11.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',203,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tb-11-t.jpg" alt="Figure 11" width="220" height="63" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>42. <strong>Decorative Self-Covered Buttons</strong>.&#8212;If a garment
  is to be trimmed with braid or if it is desired to use a button that is a little
  more decorative
    than a plain self-covered button, braid or thread may be used to relieve
    the plainness, as in the buttons shown in Fig. 11. In (<em>a</em>) is shown
    a covered button that is decorated with strands of thread arranged in hexagonal
    design
    and knotted in the center; in (<em>b</em>) is shown the spider-stitch worked
    over the covered
    button; and in (<em>c</em>), (<em>d</em>), and (<em>e</em>) are shown simple cross-applications
of soutache braid.</p>
<p> 43. The main point to remember in covering buttons is to secure the thread
    or the braid on the underneath side where it crosses. Thread used for ornamenting
    the buttons should be caught through the material at the center of the mold,
    and braid should be carefully tacked. The kind of material to use for decorating
    covered buttons depends on the individual requirements, the width and color
    of braid or thread giving inspiration for designs that are suitable for the
    purpose. Almost any of the embroidery-stitches&#8212;the cross-, satin-,
    and seed-stitches, French knots, and many others&#8212;may be used in ornamenting
    buttons. Usually those stitches which will produce a flat, tailored effect
are the ones that are preferred for this type of decorative work.</p>
<p> 44. <strong>Sewing Covered Buttons on Garments</strong>.&#8212;In sewing self-covered buttons
    on garments, it will be well to bear in mind that flat buttons are more attractive
    if sewed close to the garment, instead of being allowed to hang loose. Ball-shaped
    buttons, however, appear better if they are allowed to hang loose. Sometimes
    they are allowed to hang from a tiny cord made of buttonhole twist as for
    the overcast bar, the length of the cord varying according to the position
    of the button. This cord must be neatly made and of a color to match the
garment.</p>
<p> In sewing on any type of button, take care not to draw the material with
the sewing-stitches.</p>
<h5> <a name="crow" id="crow"></a>CROWFEET, ARROWHEADS, AND BOW-TACKS</h5>
<p> 45. <strong>Crowfeet, arrowheads, and bow-tacks</strong> are ornamental stitches used extensively
    by tailors to give a finish and a suggestion of hand-work to a tailored garment,
    the arrowheads and bow-tacks being simpler to make than the crowfeet. They
    are placed at the corners of coat collars, pockets, and pocket laps, as well
    as at the termination of seams, tucks, and plaits, at the end of machine
    stitching, and at a given point on tucks or plaits. Aside from the buttons
    of a tailored garment, these ornamental stitches, or figures, as they may
    well be called, sometimes form the entire ornament or trimming, and they
    add greatly to the finish of a tailored garment if they are well made. In
    fact, they may be used in many ways and with more satisfaction as a simple
    ornamentation, but they are not attractive if they are not perfectly made.
    If it is desired to use these stitches, a good plan is to practice making
    them in various sizes until proficiency is attained. Once the methods are
understood and skill is acquired, they will prove to be very simple.</p>
<p class="clear"> <em><a href="illust/tb-12.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',371,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tb-12-t.jpg" alt="Figure 12" width="220" height="104" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>46. <strong>Crowfeet</strong>.&#8212;In Fig. 12 (a) is shown an example of
  a crowfoot, which, as will be observed, has three points and a raised triangular
  center, all
    of which are formed in making the stitches. The 
    size of crowfeet is governed by their location on a garment, as well as by
    a person's taste, one having triangular sides &frac34; inch long being used perhaps
    the most. They are made larger than this, but seldom smaller. In working
    crowfeet, colored thread may be used, silk thread always being preferred
    for woolen materials and mercerized thread for cotton materials. The rule
    that governs the color of thread for working tailored buttonholes applies
also to crowfeet.</p>
<p> 47. <strong>Making Crowfeet</strong>.&#8212;To make a crowfoot, first, as
  shown in (b), outline a triangle with equal sides at the place where the crowfoot
  is to appear,
    using tailors' chalk that is well sharpened, so as to make distinct marks,
    especially at the corners. Begin the stitches by bringing the needle up just
    at the right of the triangle point marked a, in view (b). Then turn the work
    so that line ac of the triangle will be next to you and take a stitch as
    small as possible across point <em>b</em>. Turn the work to the left, so
    that line
    <em>ab</em> will be next to you, and take a similar stitch across point <em>c</em>.
    Again turn the work so that line <em>bc</em> is toward you and take a stitch
    across point <em>a</em>,
    bringing it up just below and close to the first stitch made at <em>a</em>.
    Continue to work in this manner, making stitches across the points and each
    one a
    little nearer the center, as shown at <em>d</em>, view (c), until the entire
    pattern is filled in. By working in this 
    way, the crowfoot will work itself out in the center, as shown in (a), without
any change in the way in which the stitch is taken.</p>
<p> In working crowfeet, take stitches as close together as possible without
      overlapping, thus rendering a compact, even surface, and increase the length
      of the stitches very gradually, so that the outline will be perfectly smooth.
      If the thickness of the material in which the crowfeet are to be worked
  will not admit of stitches being taken across the points in the manner directed,
      then, to keep a perfect pattern on both edges, two separate stitches must
      be made; that is, the needle must be inserted at one edge of the outline,
      the thread pulled through to the wrong side, and the needle then brought
  out at the opposite side.</p>
<p class="clear"> <em><a href="illust/tb-13.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',303,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tb-13-t.jpg" alt="Figure 13" width="220" height="87" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>48. As an aid to the beginner in making crowfeet, it may be well to outline
      the shape of the crowfoot in the triangle used as a guide in placing the
      stitches. To do this, it will be necessary to use a cardboard pattern,
  which may be made as follows: Draw a triangle of the correct size on a piece
  of
      cardboard and locate a point at the center of each of its equal sides,
  as in Fig. 13 (a). With these three points as a guide, outline the shape of
      the crowfoot, as shown by the dotted lines in (b). Then cut on these dotted
      lines 
      to form the pattern, which is shown in (c). To use a pattern of this kind,
      place it in the triangle marked on the goods in which the crowfoot is to
  be worked, and then outline it with tailors' chalk.</p>
<p class="clear"> 49. <strong>Arrowheads</strong>.&#8212;In Fig. 14 is<em><a href="illust/tb-14.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,217);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tb-14-t.jpg" alt="Figure 14" width="66" height="211" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em> shown how arrowheads
  may be used as trimming on a slot seam or an inverted plait. Such figures are
  so worked as to retain
    the straight sides of a triangle and are generally made smaller than crowfeet,
    being from &frac12; to &frac34; inch long on a side. They are used more freely for
  garment decoration, too, because they are suitable for use in more places on
  tailored
    garments. Arrowheads are made in much the same manner as crowfeet; in fact,
    the difference lies in the stitch, as the marking of the triangular outline
is the same, as is shown at <em>b</em>.</p>
<p class="clear"> <em><a href="illust/tb-15.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,603);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tb-15-t.jpg" alt="Figure 15" width="194" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>50. <strong>Making Arrowheads</strong>.&#8212;In making an arrowhead, refer
  to Fig. 15, which shows clearly the position of the thread and the way the
  stitches cross one
    another to form the points. With the arrow point of the triangle uppermost,
    bring the needle up as at <em>a</em>, in as at <em>b</em>, out as at <em>c</em>,
    in as at <em>d</em>, out as
    at <em>e</em>, in as at <em>f</em>, out as at <em>g</em>, in as at <em>h</em>, and out as at<em> i</em>, continuing in and out in this manner until the triangular outline is filled
    in and the
    arrowhead, when completed, appears as at <em>a</em>, Fig. 14. The necessity
    of a perfect outline will be fully
realized by a close study of the finished arrowhead.</p>
<p class="clear"> <em><a href="illust/tb-16.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',563,787);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tb-16-t.jpg" alt="Figure 16" width="220" height="165" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>51. <strong>Bow-Tacks</strong>.&#8212; In Fig. 16 is shown an example of
  a bow-tack, which is a form of trimming for tailored garments used for 
    the same, purpose as crowfeet and arrow-heads. Bow-tacks, which vary in size
    from 3/8 to &frac34; inch, depending on their position on a garment, are very
  simple of construction, but they require accurate stitching in order to obtain
  attractive
results.</p>
<p> 52. <strong>Making Bow-Tacks</strong>.&#8212;To make a bow-tack, mark
  the position on the garment by means of two vertical lines spaced the desired
  length of the bow-tack,
    using for this purpose a piece of well-sharpened tailors' chalk. Bring the
    needle up as at <em>a</em> view (a), in as at <em>b</em>, up as at <em>c</em>,
    and in as at <em>d</em>, continuing
    in this way and placing the stitches very close together until a sufficient
    number of stitches have been placed to make the bow-tack the desired width.
    After the last stitch is taken, bring the needle up midway between the two
    chalk lines, insert it, as at <em>e</em>, and bring it out, as at <em>f</em>,
    to make the cross-threads, making four or five of these through the material.
    In making the cross-stitches,
    make them a little shorter than the width of the bow-tack in order to draw
in the threads first placed and give the appearance of a bow.</p>
<h5>  <a name="straps" id="straps"></a>TAILORS' STRAPS</h5>
<p> 53. During some seasons, straps made of the material and then applied by
      means of slip-stitching or machine stitching, prove very popular as trimming
      on tailored garments. Such straps vary in width from 3/8 to 1 inch and
  they may be used to cover seams or to form designs on a garment.</p>
<p class="clear"> 54. <strong>Making Tailors' Straps</strong>.&#8212;<em><a href="illust/tb-18.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,593);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tb-18-t.jpg" alt="Figure 18" width="191" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>The<em><a href="illust/tb-17.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',214,712);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tb-17-t.jpg" alt="Figure 17" width="220" height="62" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em> material of which tailors' straps are
    made may be cut on a straight or bias grain, as desired, 
    but it should be twice the width of the desired strap and should be cut very
    accurately. If bias pieces must be joined, be sure to join 
    them on a lengthwise thread and then press the seams open. To make the straps,
    fold the strips through the middle lengthwise and overcast the raw edges
    with fairly loose stitches, as at <em>a</em>, Fig. 17. Then lay the strips flat and
    press them so that the overcast edges are in the middle
of the strap, as at <em>c</em>, Fig. 18.</p>
<p> 55. <em>To turn the edges of bias pieces</em>, pin one end of the piece right side
      down, to the right end of the ironing board, placing the pin 
      where you wish the turn made. With the left thumb and forefinger, hold
  the strip up a trifle from the ironing board and keep it just tight enough
  to
      cause the top edge to turn over toward you; press this turned edge with
  a warm iron, taking care to keep the turn the same width for the entire length
      of the piece. When one edge is completed, reverse the strip and repeat
  the
      process on the opposite side, bringing the 
  turned edges together but not overlapping them.</p>
<p class="clear"> <em><a href="illust/tb-19.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',256,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tb-19-t.jpg" alt="Figure 19" width="220" height="74" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>In silk and woolen materials, the edges should be held in place with a diagonal
      basting-stitch, as shown in Fig. 19. In very thin materials, 
      which stretch easily, it is best to turn by hand and baste the edges, 
  as basting thread stays the edges, keeping them from stretching.</p>
<p> 56. <strong>Applying Tailors' Straps</strong>.&#8212;Carefully mark with chalk where the straps
    are to be applied, and place the prepared strap on the marked line, holding
    it easy to avoid stretching. Then baste it carefully and slip-stitch it in
    place, as shown at <em>a</em>, Fig. 18. Or, if it is desired to have outside stitching,
apply the straps as shown at <em>b</em>.</p>
<h5>  <a name="frogs" id="frogs"></a>KNOTS FOR FROGS AND OTHER FANCY TRIMMINGS</h5>
<p> 57. A distinctive trimming note, frequently favored by fashion, is the frog
      ornament, developed from fabric-covered cord or the regulation silk cord
      or braid. Through just the manipulation of these cords, motifs can be readily
      fashioned that are aids to both smart dressmaking and tailoring. The instructions
      given here on the development of certain knots and trimmings, besides teaching
      how these particular ones are made, may be used as a basis for working
  out more elaborate effects suitable for some particular purpose.</p>
<p> 58. <strong>Type and Size of Cord</strong>.&#8212;Silk cords of various weights, also soutache
    and rat-tail braids, make attractive frogs and cord ornaments. Another very
    satisfactory medium is the fabric-covered cable cord, the fabric used for
    covering generally being the same as that of the garment on which the ornament
is to be placed, although it may contrast, if preferred.</p>
<p>  For a covered cord, cable cord will be found the most desirable filling,
    although, when a very soft effect is wanted, several strands of Germantown
    yarn can be substituted. If cable cord is used, it may be selected in either
    black or white and in sizes varying from 1/8 to &frac12; inch in diameter, the
  medium size producing the best results for attractiveness as well as ease of
  handling.</p>
<p> 59. <strong>Covering Cord</strong>.&#8212;The material to be used for covering
  must first be cut in strips on an absolutely true bias, so that it will be
  pliable enough
    to turn easily and elastic enough to cover the cord without wrinkles. To
    determine what the width should be, obtain a true bias edge, place over the
    cord in such a way as to have the bias follow the length of the cord, and
    pin snugly with a &frac14;-inch seam allowance along the cut bias edge. Allowing
    for a similar seam on the other edge, mark the width, remove the pin, and
    start to cut. Keeping the edge always exactly on the true bias, cut enough
    strips, which, when joined together, will equal in length the amount of cord
you wish to cover. Press open all joining seams.</p>
<p class="clear"> <em><a href="illust/tb-20.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',413,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tb-20-t.jpg" alt="Figure 20" width="220" height="108" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>To prepare the cord for covering, secure one end of it to the eye of a blunt-end
      bodkin with over-and-over stitches, as at <em>a</em>, Fig. 20. Next, fold
      your bias through the lengthwise center, wrong side out and raw edges even,
      and
  baste, as at <em>b</em>, so that the slot formed will be just the right size
  to accommodate the cord. After basting it the 
      entire length, machine-stitch in a true, even line, as at <em>c</em>. Trim
      the edges, as at <em>d</em>, to a generous 1/8 inch. Now, insert the bodkin
      into the end of the
      covering and sew the covering securely to the cord, as at <em>e</em>. Then
      slip the bodkin through the covering, as at <em>f</em>, thus drawing the
      cord through and turning
      the covering right side out. Finally, cut off the end of the cord secured
  to the bodkin.</p>
<p class="clear"> <em><a href="illust/tb-21.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',394,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tb-21-t.jpg" alt="Figure 21" width="220" height="103" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>60. <strong>Simple
    Frog</strong>.&#8212;In Fig. 21 is shown a simple type
  of frog  fastening, very easy to make and very effective when finished. Since,
  as
    a rule, a number of these ornaments are made at one time, determine the length
    of 
    cord needed for one and then cut off all the lengths that will be required,
    in this way insuring the same size for all the motifs. In the detail shown,
    each half is 3&frac12; inches long and uses 15&frac12; inches of cord. After
    cutting the cord into the proper lengths, secure the ends with a few stitches
    and wind
with thread to prevent loosening and ravelling. Use a double thread for this
    as well as for all fastening of the cords throughout the making of such motifs.</p>
<p> Form the long loop <em>a</em> for
    the fastening first, then loop <em>b</em>, considerably smaller, as shown, followed
    by
        <em>c</em>, a little larger than <em>b</em>, and then <em>d</em>, the same size as loop <em>b</em>, bringing
        the final end up to the beginning. In forming the loops, pin them in
  place, being careful to conceal the seam on the under side of each loop. Examine
        for perfection of effect, adjust, if necessary, and then sew on the wrong
        side where the loops 
        cross, securing the ends closely and neatly. Make two frogs to complete
  one motif, arrange as shown, and fasten with a button, as at<em> e</em>.</p>
<p class="clear"> <em><a href="illust/tb-22.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',533,1122);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tb-22-t.jpg" alt="Figure 22" width="200" height="93" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>61. <strong>Chinese-Knot
    Frog</strong>.&#8212;A more intricate and elaborate
  Chinese knot is the basis for the frog fastening shown in Fig. 22. Just 
    as for the simple frog ornament, supply the amount of cord needed for each
    motif as a help in making all exactly the same size. For a 4&frac12;-inch
    motif, you will need about 24 inches of cord. After cutting two cord lengths,
    secure
their ends to avoid fraying.</p>
<p class="clear"> 62. Now, form the loops, as shown in Fig. 23.<em><a href="illust/tb-24.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',436,566);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tb-24-t.jpg" alt="Figure 24" width="200" height="152" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em> Reserving<em><a href="illust/tb-23.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',402,718);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tb-23-t.jpg" alt="Figure 23" width="200" height="105" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em> a 2 &frac12;-inch end,
  form loop <em>a1</em> by holding in the left hand, between the 
    thumb and the fingers, the cord of which the knot is to be formed; then draw
    the cord around so as to form another loop <em>a<span class="small">2</span></em>, letting it cross
    loop <em>a<span class="small">1</span></em> at
    <em>b</em>; then bring it around under the first end to form still another
    loop <em>a<span class="small">3</span></em>.
    Next, bring the end of the cord held in the right hand under loop <em>a<span class="small">1</span></em>,
    at point <em>c</em>, over loop <em>a<span class="small">2</span></em> at point <em>d</em>, and again
    under loop <em>a<span class="small">1</span></em> at point
    <em>e</em>, as indicated by the arrow. Then, as shown in Fig. 24, bring the
    cord around so as to form a fourth loop <em>a<span class="small">4</span></em>, bringing the end under
    loop <em>a<span class="small">2</span></em>  at point <em>b</em>,
over loop <em>a<span class="small">3</span></em> at point <em>c</em>, and again under loop <em>a<span class="small">2</span></em> at point <em>d</em>.</p>
<p> 63. To obtain the effect shown in Fig. 22, pull out the three loops, <em>a<span class="small">1</span>,
    a<span class="small">2</span></em>,
      and <em>a<span class="small">4</span></em>, Fig. 24, and tighten loop <em>a<span class="small">2</span></em>, without shortening
      the beginning end, when the loops will appear respectively as at <em>a,
      b, c,</em> and <em>d</em>, Fig. 22,
  <em>a</em>  and <em>b</em> being the same length and <em>c</em> somewhat larger.
  With the remaining end that goes under loop <em>a<span class="small">2</span></em>, Fig. 24, make the
  long loop for the fastening, as at <em>e</em>, Fig. 22, and, with the beginning
  end, after slipping it underneath loop <em>a<span class="small">3</span></em>, form the small decorative
  loop, as at<em> f</em>. When the knot and loops
      are even and true, tack invisibly where they cross on the wrong side, always
      keeping the seam of the covering concealed, and sew the ends securely underneath.
  Two of these motifs are needed to complete an ornament.</p>
<p class="clear"> <em><a href="illust/tb-25.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',470,575);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tb-25-t.jpg" alt="Figure 25" width="200" height="162" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>64. <strong>Triple Motif Fastening</strong>.&#8212;Another effective trimming, especially
    adapted to covered cord, is the fastening for a belt or the front of a frock
    or blouse shown in Fig. 25, one or two of such motifs being made, as the
    need requires. From 11 to 12 inches of cord will be needed for each of the
three details that make up the ornament and about 6 inches for the loop.</p>
<p class="clear"> <em><a href="illust/tb-26.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',422,455);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tb-26-t.jpg" alt="Figure 26" width="200" height="178" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>65. Cut the required number of lengths and secure the ends, as at <em>a</em>, Fig.
      26. Starting at the center, begin to wind the cord round 
      and round, first making sure that the beginning end is well under the cord.
      Tack it securely there, being careful that the stitches do not show on
  the right side. Then, holding the cord quite taut, continue to wind it, whipping
      the cords together as you go, as at <em>b</em>. Examine the right side frequently
      to assure yourself that the seam of the cording is concealed and that the
      ornament is kept flat and smooth and as nearly circular as possible. As
  you
  approach the end, slip it under and fasten securely.</p>
<p> Make three such circular details. Next, fasten the ends of the loop section
      together, and, as in Fig. 25, place one of the circular motifs over it,
  as at <em>a</em>, and one on each side of it, as at <em>b</em> and <em>c</em>, to give the effect illustrated.
  Sew securely.</p>
<p> When attaching an ornament of this kind to the garment, first pin it in place
      and then slip-stitch all around the outside of the circular portions, placing
  a secure stitch or two in the center.</p>
<p>  <a name="tassels" id="tassels"></a>66. <strong>Tassels</strong>.&#8212;An attractive trimming feature that is simple to make
    is the tassel. Developed of wool yarn, tightly twisted embroidery silk, or
    mercerized cotton or linen threads, depending on the use to which the tassels
are to be put, they will be found an effective dress as well as hat decoration.</p>
<p class="clear"> <em><a href="illust/tb-27.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',428,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tb-27-t.jpg" alt="Figure 27" width="220" height="112" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>67. In Fig. 27 is shown a completed tassel and the various steps in its making.
      To make a tassel like that shown in view (a), make a double cardboard gauge,
      as shown in view (b), of a size that will give the desired length to the
      tassel and having its upper corners cut off as shown so that they will
  not interfere with the wrapping of the thread and will permit the loops of
  thread
      to be removed easily. Wrap the thread or yarn to be used around the cardboard
      gauge in the manner shown in view (b); leaving one end to project from
  4 to 6 inches, as at <em>a</em>, to be used in finishing the upper part of the tassel,
      and tying the thread at the top with the other end in a loop knot, as at
      <em>b</em>, to hold the loops together after they are slipped off the cardboard.
  The
      number of times to wrap the thread will depend on the number of threads
  that are wanted in the tassel. After the thread is wrapped and secured, draw
  the
      knot <em>b</em>, view (b), down to the point where the tassel is to be wound, letting
      the free end hang down to form part of the tassel threads. Then thread
  an embroidery needle with the thread end <em>a</em>, remove all the wrapped thread from
      the cardboard gauge, and, holding it together at the center, 
      wind the thread that is in the needle around the bunch of thread several
      times, as at <em>a</em>, view (c). Next, insert the needle, as at<em> b</em>, and bring it
      out, as at <em>c</em>, taking it through the thread so as to hold it in place. Then
      bring it around, as in view (d), to form a loop <em>a</em>, inserting the needle
  on
      the side opposite <em>c</em>, view (c). With this done, put the needle in the loop
      and draw this thread up so that it will hold the threads close together,
      as at <em>a</em>, view (a). With the upper part thus wrapped and fastened, slip
  the scissors inside the looped threads and clip the lower end of the tassel
  straight
  across, so that all the threads will be uniform in length.</p>
<p>  <a name="fringe" id="fringe"></a>68. <strong>Fringe</strong>.&#8212;Garments and certain
  accessories are often trimmed with fringe, a form of ornament consisting of
  threads, cords, or tassels from
    1 to 40 inches deep, allowed to hang straight or knotted in various ways.
    The simplest form of fringe is that in which the edge of a loosely woven
    material is frayed out. The other form is the tied, or knotted, variety,
    made of wool, silk, or cotton threads attached to material or to a braid
or binding.</p>
<p class="clear"> <em><a href="illust/tb-28.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',471,665);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tb-28-t.jpg" alt="Figure 28" width="200" height="140" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>69<em>. To make frayed fringe</em>, machine-stitch the material to be frayed, the
      number of inches from the raw edge that you wish the fringe to be in
  width, following a thread of the material, as at a, Fig. 28. Then, begin at
  the
      edge and pull out the threads up to the machine-stitching. This method
  will prevent further fraying.</p>
<p> 70. <em>For tied</em>, or <em>knotted, fringe,</em> choose smoothly twisted thread that has
      enough weight to hang evenly. To compute the amount required, determine
      what is needed for just one knot and then 
  approximate the entire amount by multiplying this by the number of knots.</p>
<p> To cut the threads accurately, prepare a strip of cardboard as long as your
      fringe is to be, wind the thread on this, and then cut through the threads
  along one edge.</p>
<p class="clear"> <em><a href="illust/tb-29.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',608,442);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tb-29-t.jpg" alt="Figure 29" width="143" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Supply a needle with a large eye, one that will accommodate from 3 to 4 strands
      of the thread, and thread this, the number of strands depending on the
  weight of the thread and the thickness of the fringe; then pull it through
  the finished edge of your material, as at <em>a</em>, Fig. 29. Adjust the threads
  so that they are even and, holding them all together, tie in a plain knot close
  to the edge of the fabric. The knot in the process of tying will appear as
  shown at
  b,
  and
  the
  completed
  knot,
  as
  at c.</p>
<p> Now draw in a second group of threads, &frac12; inch or farther from the first,
      and tie these in the same manner as the first group. Proceed in this way
  across the entire edge.</p>
<p> To form the second row of knots, take one-half the threads from one group
      and one-half from the next and, drawing them together, knot them, as shown
      at b, the completed knots appearing as at d. Complete the fringe by knotting
  the threads at the beginning and the end, as at e.</p>

<h3>    <a name="precaution" id="precaution"></a>PRECAUTIONS IN MAKING TAILORED SEAMS</h3>
  <p> 1. <strong>Tailored seams</strong>, many kinds of which are used in tailored costumes,
    require generous seam allowance and careful basting, stitching, and pressing.
    Their
    development is not difficult, however, and if you take the time to carry
out each detail, you will undoubtedly obtain very gratifying results.</p>
  <p> 2. <strong>Seam Allowance</strong>.&#8212;Patterns used by tailors are
    usually of a type that have no seam allowance, a 1-inch seam being provided
    when cutting, because
    of the type of seams used in tailoring work. Be guided by this, therefore,
    and even when using a pattern having the regulation 3/8-inch seam allowance,
    make provision for the extra seam width necessary. Seam lines are always
marked by tracing, chalk, basting, or mark-stitches.</p>
  <p> 3. <strong>Mark-Stitching</strong>.&#8212;Too much emphasis cannot be laid on the value of
    mark-stitching along the seam lines that are indicated by the tracing, chalk
    marks, or basting applied with the pattern in position on the material, as
    this stitching will mark both sides of the garment exactly alike and show
    accurate positions for pockets or trimming features that are to be the same
on both sides of the garment.</p>
  <p class="clear"> <a href="illust/tsp-01.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',481,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tsp-01-t.jpg" alt="Figure 1" width="140" height="85" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>The method of making mark-stitches is shown in Fig. 1. Take a short stitch
    through the two thicknesses of material, and over this take a back-stitch
    of the same length, as at <em>a</em>, leaving a good-sized loop, as shown.
    Skip &frac34; inch and repeat. After basting the entire length of the seam in
    this way,
    draw the two thicknesses of material apart and cut the threads between them,
    as at <em>b</em> and <em>c</em>. Then short 
    threads will be left in each piece to mark the pattern line accurately and
the two pieces will be marked exactly alike.</p>
  <p> It may seem to some persons that mark-stitching takes too much time; but
    it is the only way in which to make sure of a clean, exact line for basting
    or stitching in woolen materials, and the personal satisfaction derived in
    putting together a garment that has been carefully mark-stitched more than
repays for the time consumed.</p>
  <p> 4. <strong>Basting</strong>.&#8212;Before basting the seams, to prevent
    stretching one edge and thus making it longer than the other, pin the edges
    together at frequent
    intervals, inserting the pins perpendicularly to the seam line so that they
    will not cause annoyance 
    while the basting is being done. Then baste with short stitches, being careful
not to stretch the seam.</p>
  <p> 5. <strong>Stitching</strong>.&#8212;For stitching woolen, use silk or mercerized cotton thread
    that is a tone darker than the fabric. Some of the extremely dark shades,
    particularly the darkest blue, may satisfactorily be stitched with black
    thread; as a rule, however, thread can be matched to fabric with little difficulty.
    In any event, in selecting thread, consider the fact that it will work up
    a little lighter than it appears on the spool. The proper way in which to
    secure a perfect match is to lay a single thread across the material in good
daylight or under one of the lamps provided by some shops.</p>
  <p> Another good point to remember in connection with thread used for tailored
    seams is that the manufacturer numbers the colors  on the spools; therefore,
    if you need to procure more thread of exactly the same color, note the number
    on the spool you have emptied and be sure to
purchase the same one.</p>
  <p> 6. Before starting to stitch, test the machine-stitching on a scrap of
    material like that used for the garment in order to make sure that the tension,
    the
    length of the stitch, and the size of the needle are correct. Very fine stitching
    is not suitable for tailored garments, as it draws the material down and
    mars the smooth surface. Very long stitches, too, should be avoided, but
    they are permissible when the stitching is intended for decorative purposes,
this, as a rule, requiring heavier silk than would otherwise be used.</p>
  <p> In stitching, strive always for extreme accuracy. The marked seam line
    will serve as a guide when you are applying the first stitching on the wrong
    side,
    this stitching being required for most seams; but when stitching on the right
    side, use a sewing-machine gauge or quilter or mark the line you wish to
follow, unless your eye is sufficiently well-trained to gauge spaces properly.</p>
  <p> Attention must be given to the adjustment of the gauge or quilter. Be guided
    by your sewing-machine instruction book when placing either attachment in
    position, being careful to adjust the quilter just high enough to permit
    the material to pass freely under it. On some sewing machines, you will find
    it impossible to adjust the gauge or the quilter on the left-hand side of
    the presser-foot, and, in some cases, if you use the quilter as a gauge,
    you will have to turn it backwards. In such instances, extreme care must
be taken to follow exactly along the edge that is to be stitched.</p>
  <p> 7. <strong>Pressing</strong>.&#8212;Pressing, too, is of decided importance. In making tailored
    seams, press each stage of the work as you advance, always pressing lengthwise
    of the seam and making it as flat as possible. Also, press the finished seams.
    As a general rule, the pressing should be done entirely on the wrong side
of the material.</p>
  <h3> <a name="seams" id="seams"></a>KINDS OF SEAMS</h3>
  <p> <a name="plain" id="plain"></a>8. <strong>Plain Seam</strong>.&#8212;The plain seam is used even more
    extensively in woolen materials than it is in wash fabrics. Many distinctive
    dresses are assembled
    by means of plain seams, not a stitch showing anywhere on the outside of
    the garment. When such is the case, the responsibility of the seams is very
    great, for it is 
    through the perfection of their making and pressing that they take their
place inconspicuously in a tailored garment.</p>
  <p> To make a plain seam, place the right sides of the material together so
    that one mark-stitched seam line is directly over the
    other; then baste along the mark-stitched line and, after the fitting of
the garment, stitch on the basted line.</p>
  <p class="clear"><a href="illust/tsp-02.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,814);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tsp-02-t.jpg" alt="Figure 2" width="180" height="141" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>In order to finish such a seam in woolen material, open it out, as shown
    in Fig. 2, and then press well on the wrong side with a moderately hot iron,
    or, if the material is not heavy, you may turn the seam edges together to
    one side if you wish. In some cases, it is not necessary to use any moisture
    in order to 
    press the seam open satisfactorily, but if you find it difficult to make
    the seam edges lie flat without first dampening them, run a slightly
    moistened sponge or sponge cloth along the opened seam and then press it.
    The use of considerable moisture in the pressing of seams takes from the
softness of finish that is generally desirable in women's garments.</p>
  <p class="clear"><a href="illust/tsp-03.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,563);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tsp-03-t.jpg" alt="Figure 3" width="140" height="155" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>9. Instead of pressing seams in velvet or in woolen fabrics having a nap
    that is not pressed flat, steam them open by running them over the edge of
    an inverted hot iron that has been covered with a damp cloth, as shown in
    Fig. 3. The velvet presser described in Art. 18, Chapter I, is, of course,
satisfactory, too.</p>
  <p> 10. Finish the edges of a plain seam by notching, pinking, overcasting,
    or binding them, according to the nature of the fabric, notching or pinking
    closely woven fabrics, such as flannel and broadcloth, binding those that
    fray readily, and overcasting those that do not require binding and yet need
a more lasting finish than notching or pinking would provide.</p>
  <p class="clear"><a href="illust/tsp-04.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',517,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tsp-04-t.jpg" alt="Figure 4" width="180" height="117" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a> <a name="single" id="single"></a>11. <strong>Single-Stitch Seam</strong>.&#8212;The single-stitch seam, illustrated in Fig.
    4, makes an attractive finish for a plain seam. To make this seam, first
    carefully press and baste both edges back from the stitched line of the plain
    seam; then stitch accurately on both sides the distance from the seam line
    you desire. The presser-foot of the sewing machine serves as a good guide
    in doing such work. It is well first to stitch along the right side of the
    seam, keeping the edge of the presser-foot in line with the plain seam, and
    then, when this side is stitched, to repeat the operation on the other side
of the seam line.</p>
  <p class="clear"><a href="illust/tsp-05.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',497,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tsp-05-t.jpg" alt="Figure 5" width="180" height="114" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a> <a name="double" id="double"></a>12. <strong>Double-Stitch Seam</strong>.&#8212;To
    make the double-stitch seam. which is illustrated in Fig. 5, baste as for
    a single-stitch seam;
    then baste back 3/8 inch or more
    on each side of the first basting. Add 
    stitching on both sides of the plain seam as close to it as possible, making
    a single-stitch seam; and then stitch back 3/8 inch or more on each side
of the first stitching, as shown in the illustration.</p>
  <p class="clear"><a href="illust/tsp-06.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',550,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tsp-06-t.jpg" alt="Figure 6" width="180" height="124" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a> <a name="cord" id="cord"></a>13. <strong>Cord Seam</strong>.&#8212;Make the cord seam, Fig. 6, as follows:
    Baste a plain seam, but do not stitch it, as the outside stitching is 
    all that is necessary; then, instead of pressing the seam open, turn seam
    edges to one side and baste them. Next, with the presser foot of the machine
    as a guide, stitch 1/8 to &frac14; inch from the
    seam edge through the three thicknesses. When the basting is removed, the
effect is similar to that of a corded seam.</p>
  <p> Instead of giving the cord seam a final pressing as suggested for tailored
    seams in general, press merely along the row of stitching, taking care not
    to let the iron extend over the outer edge, or corded 
    effect, for a flat pressing would make the seam appear as a tuck rather 
than a cord.</p>
  <p class="clear"> <a name="welt" id="welt"></a>14. <strong>Welt Seam</strong>.&#8212;<a href="illust/tsp-08.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,583);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tsp-08-t.jpg" alt="Figure 8" width="140" height="159" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>The<a href="illust/tsp-07.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',560,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tsp-07-t.jpg" alt="Figure 7" width="180" height="126" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>    welt seam, which is shown in Fig. 7, should be made as follows: First, baste
    and stitch as in making a plain seam; then cut away one seam edge to within
    &frac14; inch of the stitching, as shown at <em>a</em>, Fig. 8. Next, bind, notch, or overcast
    the wide seam allowance, and turn both back against the fabric
    of the garment. With the right side of the material up, as in Fig. 7, press
    the material away carefully from the seam with the fingers so that it will
    not overlap in any place. Next, baste along
    the seam edge and then back &frac12; inch, or almost the width of the stitching
    desired. Finally, stitch the desired width, usually 3/8 or &frac12; inch from
    the seam, using a sewing-machine gauge or quilter for this purpose, if you
    wish
a guide to insure even spacing.</p>
  <p class="clear"><a href="illust/tsp-09.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',517,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tsp-09-t.jpg" alt="Figure 9" width="180" height="119" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a> <a name="doublewelt" id="doublewelt"></a>15. <strong>Double-Stitched Welt</strong>.&#8212;To make the double-stitched welt, an example
    of which is shown in Fig. 9, follow all the instructions for making a welt
    seam, and in addition apply a second row of stitching on the seam turn, as
is clearly shown at <em>a</em>.</p>
  <p class="clear"> <a name="tuck" id="tuck"></a>16. <strong>Tuck Seam</strong>.&#8212;<a href="illust/tsp-11.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',564,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tsp-11-t.jpg" alt="Figure 11" width="180" height="128" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>The <a href="illust/tsp-10.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',517,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tsp-10-t.jpg" alt="Figure 10" width="180" height="118" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>tuck seam, or <em>open welt</em>,
    as shown in Fig. 10, is made as follows: First baste as a plain seam, but
    do not stitch. Then turn
    both seam edges to one side and baste them as in making the cord seam. Then,
    from the right side, add another 
    row of basting the desired tuck width from the seam edge, as shown in Fig.
    11. Place a row of stitching the desired distance, usually &frac14; to 1 inch
    from the seam edge; then remove the basting and mark-stitches, and the seam
    will
appear as a tuck, as in Fig. 10.</p>
  <p class="clear"> <a name="slot" id="slot"></a>17. <strong>Slot Seam</strong>.&#8212;<a href="illust/tsp-13.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',556,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tsp-13-t.jpg" alt="Figure 13" width="180" height="126" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>The<a href="illust/tsp-12.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',536,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tsp-12-t.jpg" alt="Figure 12" width="180" height="118" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>    slot seam, which is illustrated in Fig. 12, requires an allowance of &frac34;
    to 1 inch for each seam edge. Make
    the seam as follows:
    baste as for a plain seam, with short, even basting-stitches, and press the
    seam open. Then cut a strip lengthwise of the material, making it a little
    longer than the seam and &frac12; inch wider than the
    pressed-open seam measures from one edge to the other, as shown in Fig. 13.
    Place the right side of the strip to 
    the wrong side of the garment, pin the center of the strip directly under
    the seam, as at <em>a</em>. Take care that the strip is eased a trifle, as
    it should not be stretched in the least. Baste from the right 
    side, with diagonal basting, as shown at <em>b</em>, holding the seam firmly
    with the left hand and thus avoiding any possibility of stretching the strip
    or
    the seam. Next, baste and stitch 3/8 to &frac34; inch from the seam on each side.
    When the bastings are removed, the seam will have the appearance of two tuck
seams meeting.</p>
  <p> If you wish to make the <em>slot seam with inside stitching</em>, as shown in Fig.
    12, lift the inside edges of the slot seam, or tucks, and stitch as close
to the edge as possible, but do not stitch through the underneath strip.</p>
  <p class="clear"> <a name="overlapped" id="overlapped"></a>18. <strong>Overlapped Seam</strong>.&#8212;<a href="illust/tsp-14.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',445,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tsp-14-t.jpg" alt="Figure 14" width="180" height="101" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>A method of joining a seam
    of irregular shape is shown in Fig. 14. To make the overlapped seam, first
    determine which edge
    is to be on top, turn it in a seam's width, 
    and baste, as at <em>a</em>. At outward turning points, fold the turn over
    neatly, as at <em>b</em>, while at inward turning ones, slash the seam allowance,
    as at <em>c</em>.
    Clip any curved edges. Lap the two edges, pin at right angles to the seam,
    as at <em>d</em>, baste, as at <em>e</em>, and then stitch close to the edge
of the turn, as at <em>f</em>.</p>
  <p class="clear"> <a name="lapseam" id="lapseam"></a>19. <strong>Lap Seam</strong>.&#8212;<a href="illust/tsp-15.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',492,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tsp-15-t.jpg" alt="Figure 15" width="140" height="87" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>The lap seam, illustrated in Fig.
    15, is used only on heavy, firmly woven materials that do not fray. An allowance
    of 3/8 to 5/8 inch
    is necessary for this seam. To make the seam, lap the edges, seam lines
    coinciding, but do not turn the outside 
    edges under; baste and stitch the outside edges, making the rows of stitching
    absolutely parallel and stitching as close to the edges as possible, as shown
at <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>. Do not use selvage edges.</p>
  <p class="clear"> <a name="strapseam" id="strapseam"></a>20. <strong>Strap Seam</strong>.&#8212;<a href="illust/tsp-16.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',528,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tsp-16-t.jpg" alt="Figure 16" width="140" height="94" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>The strap seam, an example of which is shown in Fig.
    16, is simply a plain seam with a good seam allowance, over which, after
    the seam has been pressed open, is placed a bias strap of the same or some
contrasting material. The procedure in making this seam is as follows:</p>
  <p class="clear"> For the strap, cut a bias piece of the material twice the width that the
    finished strap is to be; catch the edges together with a diagonal basting-stitch,
    as in <a href="illust/tsp-17.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',597,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tsp-17-t.jpg" alt="Figure 17" width="140" height="108" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>Fig. 17, taking care that the basting 
    does not show on the right side and that the edges do not overlap and cause
    a ridge after the seam is pressed; and then press the strap, being very careful
    not to twist it in the least. Next, place the strap directly over the seam
    on the right side, and baste it in position with diagonal basting, as shown.
    Finally, baste the outside edges down and stitch on each edge of the strap,
so that it will appear, when finished, as in Fig. 16.</p>
  <p> Sometimes, on garments where machine-stitching is not desirable, the edges
of the strap are slip-stitched down or secured with a decorative stitch.</p>
  <p> <a name="variations" id="variations"></a>21. <strong>Use of Tailored Seams</strong>.&#8212;Knowledge of sewing or
    tailoring processes does not attain its true meaning until it has been put
    to 
    use. It is essential, therefore, when making up skirts, suits, and coats,
    or even in some cases dresses, that the proper procedure as regards seams
be followed.</p>
  <p> The plain seam and the overlapped seam are preferred joinings in the majority
    of cases. Still, if the true tailored feeling is best expressed by seams
    of other types, they should be used. For instance, the single-stitch seam
    may properly be selected for the lengthwise seams of a coat, the cord seam
    for the same purpose in both coats and suits, the welt seam, the double-stitched
    welt, and the lap seam for top coats, overcoats, and outerwear for children.
    The lap seam is especially valuable when joining two sections of a heavy
    weave that will not fray, such as double-faced overcoatings, which require
no lining.</p>
  <p> Always, therefore, when working with woolen fabrics, look at the work from
    the tailoring point of view and choose your seam finish just as carefully
    as you would select your trimming, so that the finished work may have a professional
look.</p>
  <h3> <a name="requirements" id="requirements"></a>REQUIREMENTS OP TAILORED PLACKETS</h3>
  <p> 22. <strong>Tailored plackets</strong>, or openings in skirts that permit
    them to be slipped over the head with ease, are not unlike wash plackets,
    yet because of the
    materials used in the construction of tailored skirts, the methods of making
    them differ and they demand greater care. Tailored plackets require more
    basting and pressing than do wash plackets; in fact, extreme care must be
    taken with any tailored placket so as not to stretch either of its sides,
    for the woolen materials used in tailored skirts are almost ungovernable
    when they are once stretched. Also, as the facing silk often used in the
    construction of tailored plackets differs in weight and texture from the
    skirt material, it, too, must be carefully handled, so that it will not appear
    drawn or too full in any place. However, to make a placket that fastens up
    so perfectly that the skirt opening does not attract undue attention doubly
repays any one for the time and effort that must be expended in its construction.</p>
  <p> 23. <strong>Essentials of Placket Making</strong>.&#8212;To be able to
    make strictly tailored skirts successfully, it is imperative that these tailored
    plackets be thoroughly
    understood and mastered. A good plan, therefore, is to procure pieces of
    woolen material of suitable size and to make the plackets in the order in
    which they are 
    described; then, when it is desired to make a tailored skirt, the finishing
of the placket will not seem difficult.</p>
  <p> As in the making of tailored seams, the importance of accurately mark-stitched
    seam lines, careful basting, and frequent pressing in the development of
tailored plackets cannot be overestimated.</p>
  <p> Each seam and each edge of any tailored placket should be carefully basted
    and pressed before any stitching is done, because woolen materials will slip
    and stretch under the presser-foot of the sewing machine unless they are
    carefully held in place with basting. Especially is basting necessary in
the application of the facing pieces.</p>
  <p> 24. <strong>Facing of Plackets</strong>.&#8212;To finish most tailored
    plackets properly, lengthwise facing strips of flat crepe, satin, taffeta,
    or sateen are needed,
    and, no matter which material is used, it is generally 
    referred to as <em>facing silk</em>. If the skirt is to be a very fine one, a good,
    firm quality of flat crepe or a firmly woven satin may be used as a finish.
    For the majority of woolen skirts, silk crepe of good quality is used, and
    for very heavy skirts sateen of close, fine weave is desirable. In the selection
    of a facing, however, it is of the utmost importance to choose material that
    is in keeping with the material and the style of the skirt and that will
    wear equally as well as the skirt material. It is very unsatisfactory to
    use a facing material that does not correspond with the skirt material or
    that will wear out before the garment does. Also, as the facing of the placket
    must, in many instances, turn back over the rings of the hooks and come well
    up under the prongs, the facing material must of necessity be thin enough
not to interfere in the hooking of the skirt.</p>
  <h3> <a name="plackets" id="plackets"></a>KINDS OF PLACKETS </h3>
  <h4>PLAIN-SEAM PLACKET</h4>
  <p class="clear"> <a name="plainseam" id="plainseam"></a>25. <strong>Nature of Placket</strong>.&#8212;<a href="illust/tsp-18.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',618,318);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tsp-18-t.jpg" alt="Figure 18" width="100" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>A skirt that is not tight-fitting does not require
    especial strength at the placket opening because there is very little strain
    on the opening. In such a skirt, the <strong>plain-seam placket</strong>, which is very simply
    made, as shown in Fig. 18, may be used. In a placket of this kind, there
    should be no suggestion of its finish on the right side. The usual position
of such a placket is at the center side above a plain seam.</p>
  <p> Because of the ease in a skirt of this type, the placket opening need not
    be so long as in a plain, fitted skirt and, for this reason, the plain-seam
    placket is generally made not more than 8 inches long, this length permitting
the skirt to be slipped off easily.</p>
  <p class="clear"> <a href="illust/tsp-19.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,319);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tsp-19-t.jpg" alt="Figure 19" width="100" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>26. <strong>Applying Placket Stay Tapes</strong>.&#8212;The seam lines
    that were mark-stitched in the cutting of the skirt ate essential in the
    making 
    of the placket, for they serve as a guide for the placing of the tapes that
    are used as a stay for the placket edges and as a foundation for the fasteners.
    After stitching the side seam of the skirt, baste a piece of tape &frac12; inch
    or so longer than the opening left for the placket, on the wrong side of
    the skirt, as at <em>a</em>, Fig. 19, so that one edge of the tape is in
    line with the mark-stitching that indicates the seam line on one side of
    the placket.
    Then stitch the tape through the center, 
    thus making a row of stitching show on the opposite side of the material,
as at <em>b</em>, a short distance from the seam line.</p>
  <p> Baste and stitch a similar strip along the other side of the placket, also,
    as at <em>c</em>, making sure that the edge of the tape is exactly along the mark-stitched
    seam line. Then turn under the front, or upper, portion of the placket along
the mark-stitched line and baste and press it flat.</p>
  <p> 27. <strong>Finishing the Seam Edges</strong>.&#8212;In most cases, the
    seam edges below the placket may be turned and pressed together toward the
    front-skirt portion,
    but if a pressed-open seam is essential, clip the seam allowance on the back-
    or under-placket edge straight across at the lower end of the placket, in
order to permit this seam edge to lie perfectly flat.</p>
  <p> To finish the raw seam edges, overcast them or, if the material is of a
    kind that frays readily, bind the edges with a light-weight silk binding,
    extending
    the overcasting or binding along the full length of the seam, including the
    placket edges, and across the slash in the seam edge if one was made at the
lower end of the placket.</p>
  <p> 28. <strong>Applying the Snap Fasteners</strong>.&#8212;Three or four snap
    fasteners are sufficient for a placket of this kind. In applying them, sew
    them directly over the
    lines of stitching that hold the tapes in position, as shown in Fig. 18,
    and take the stitches through the tape as well as the material, so as to
    make them very secure. When sewing the snaps along the upper-placket edge,
    however, be very careful not to catch the stitches through to the right side;
    take them through merely the turned-under placket edge and the tape, so that
    there may not be even a suggestion of the stitches on the outside of the
skirt.</p>
  <p> In sewing snap fasteners on a placket, remember to sew the part containing
    the projection to the top of the placket. Begin at the bottom, placing the
    first one about 1 inch from the end of the placket and the others 2 inches
    apart. Sew the two parts of the fasteners directly opposite each other to
produce a flat, smooth effect.</p>
  <p> 29. <strong>Securing the Turned-Under Portion</strong>.&#8212;In order
    to hold the turned-under upper portion of the placket in position when the
    skirt is being worn, it
    should be secured with slip-stitching. In doing the slip-stitching, fold
    back about &frac14; inch of the turned-under portion, as shown in Fig. 18, and
    take the stitches, as at <em>a</em>, 
    very close together, catching only a thread or two of the material in the
    turned edge as well as in the material underneath so as to avoid having these
    stitches show on the right side of the skirt. Also, do not draw the stitches
    up tight; rather, permit sufficient ease in them so that the edge that was
    folded back to facilitate the slip-stitching Will fall back over these stitches
and lie perfectly fiat.</p>
  <h4> <a name="weltseam" id="weltseam"></a>WELT-SEAM PLACKET</h4>
  <p class="clear"> <a href="illust/tsp-20.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,518);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tsp-20-t.jpg" alt="Figure 20" width="140" height="169" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>30. The <strong>welt-seam placket</strong> is shown in Fig. 20. This style of placket is
    used in fitted, gored skirts, usually at the left center-side seam, or at
    the left side of, a front or back panel. Also, it may be employed on a skirt
    finished with plain pressed-open seams as well as on
    one having seam edges turned to one side and finished with outside stitching.
    The placket here illustrated is at the left side of a two-piece skirt that
has its waist line supported by an inside belt.</p>
  <p class="clear"> <a href="illust/tsp-21.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,375);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tsp-21-t.jpg" alt="Figure 21" width="118" height="205" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>31. <strong>Applying the Facings</strong>.&#8212;For the 
    welt-seam placket, cut
    two strips of facing silk, making each about If inches wide and a trifle
    longer than the placket opening. After finishing the skirt seam, clip across
    the underneath seam edge at the lower end of the placket, as shown at <em>a</em>,
    Fig. 21. This clipping must be done on the one seam edge to permit it to
    extend under the other and to make the seam lie perfectly flat when the placket
    is lapped into position. If a welt seam is used for the skirt, then it will
    not be necessary to clip the seam at the bottom of the placket, because the
    edges of the 
    seam will then come over each other in the forming of the welt and will not
have to be pressed open.</p>
  <p> Next, place a strip of facing silk over the gore that is to form the under
    part of the placket, with their right sides together and edges even, and
    baste &frac14; inch from the edge. Turn it to the wrong side like a binding, fold
    the raw edge of the strip over to meet the raw seam edge of the placket,
    as shown, and crease and baste the turned edge, as at <em>b</em>. When this
    turned edge is folded back in position, 
it will be close to the mark-stitched line at <em>c</em>.</p>
  <p> When this strip is basted in position, proceed with the other facing strip.
    Lay it so that its right side is to the wrong side of the skirt portion,
    as at <em>d</em>, and the edge of the facing is even with the mark-stitched seam line.
    Then baste this facing strip in position, as at <em>e</em>, and baste again, as at
<em>f</em>, so as to hold the facing silk firmly.</p>
  <p class="clear"> <a href="illust/tsp-22.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,561);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tsp-22-t.jpg" alt="Figure 22" width="140" height="156" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>32. <strong>Stitching the Placket</strong>.
   With the right side of the underlapping portion uppermost, stitch about &frac14;
    inch from the edge, keeping the stitching on the facing silk, as shown in
    Fig. 22. This stitching appears as at<em> a</em> on the wrong side. Then
    stitch the upper-placket edge, stitching from the right side &frac14; to &frac12;
    inch from the edge, as at <em>a</em>, Fig, 20, and continuing the line of
    stitching to
    the bottom of the placket. In stitching,
    hold the underneath portion of the placket away so that it will not be caught
    in with the stitching; also, be sure to use a gauge or to mark with basting
    threads the line on which to stitch so that there will be no danger that
    the stitching-will appear crooked, for in a very plain placket of this kind
    the 
    workmanship must be as nearly perfect as possible, in order that the break
between seam and placket may be imperceptible.</p>
  <p> When you reach a point about &frac14; inch from the bottom of the placket, lift
    the needle and the presser-foot and draw the material out just a trifle in
    order to leave a thread length of about &frac12; inch between the end of the stitching
    and the needle. Then, with the placket still under the presser-foot, turn
    the under-placket edge, or seam allowance, back underneath the upper portion
    and adjust 
    the material under the presser-foot in order to continue stitching diagonally
    to the seam line, as shown in Fig. 20, without causing a break or unevenness
    in the line of stitching. Before continuing the stitching, however, turn
    the spool of thread on the machine so as to wind up the extra thread length
    that was drawn out. Then, when the stitching is continued, no loop of thread
    will show on the right side, but the extra bobbin-thread length will remain
    and loop over the under-seam edge without puckering it as would be the case
if the extra thread length had not been provided.</p>
  <p> After completing the stitching, pull the threads through and fasten them.
    This diagonal row of stitching makes the bottom of
the placket secure and holds the upper and underneath portions together.</p>
  <p> If you prefer, you may omit the outside machine-stitching entirely and
    secure the turned edge by catch-stitching it through the facing silk to the
    right
    side of the skirt, making the stitches as tiny as possible so that they will
be practically invisible on the right side.</p>
  <p> 33. <strong>Finishing the Placket</strong>.&#8212;Before putting on either hooks and eyes
    or snap fasteners, press the placket thoroughly so that it will He perfectly
    smooth and not appear stretched or puckered in any place. If you use snap
    fasteners for fastening the placket, as in this case, fold the free edge
    of the facing silk on the upper edge of the placket back over the raw edge
    of the skirt seam, turn in the facing edge, and whip it down directly over
    the stitching that is put in from the right side. If you use hooks and eyes,
    sew the hooks on first and then bring the strip over, turn in the edge, and
hem it down underneath the prongs of the hooks themselves.</p>
  <p> In a placket of this kind, always take care to overcast the lower edges
    so that the placket will appear neatly finished. When the placket is stitched
    and pressed, proceed to put on the fasteners, remembering always to begin
    at the bottom of the placket opening to mark their positions and to sew them
on in the same order so as to have any fulness come out at the waist line.</p>
  <p> 34. <strong>Applying the Belting</strong>.&#8212;Cut the belting 2 inches
    longer than the waist measure and make a &frac34;-inch hem at each end so that
    the hemmed ends meet
    without overlapping. Sew on the two lower hooks and eyes, leaving a space
    for the upper ones. Place the hooks with the ends of the prongs just inside
    the end of the belting, and the eyes with the loops extending 1/8 inch beyond
the other end.</p>
  <p> To apply the belt, as in Fig. 22, so that no stitching appears on the right
    side of the skirt, first hook it around the waist line, put on the skirt,
    and fasten the placket. Bring the edge of the back part of the placket even
    with the corresponding end of the belt, turn the edge of the skirt over the
    belting &frac12; inch, and pin it securely. Continue turning over and pinning
    the upper edge until you reach the other end of the belt. The placket extends
about 1 inch beyond this end of the belting, thus allowing for the overlap.</p>
  <p> Remove the pins one at a time and reinsert them through the belt and the
    turned-over edge so that the skirt may be laid flat. Baste the skirt and
    belting together 3/8 inch below the top of the belting, 
    trim the edge of the skirt close to the basting, and cover this edge with
    bias binding. Stitch this on both edges, as shown. Turn the belting against
    the skirt and secure the binding that extends beyond the front end of the
    belting to the skirt with back-stitches, without allowing them to go through
to the right side. Sew on the remaining hook and eye and snap.</p>
  <p class="clear"> <a href="illust/tsp-23.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,423);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tsp-23-t.jpg" alt="Figure 23" width="96" height="212" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>35. <strong>Welt-Seam Placket in Tailored Wash Skirt</strong>.&#8212;The
    way  in which to make a welt-seam placket for a tailored wash skirt is shown
    in
    Fig. 23. Apply the under facing for this placket in much 
    the same manner as for a similar placket in woolen material, but, instead
    of folding the facing under and leaving it loose, stitch it flat, as at <em>a</em>,
    1/8 to &frac14; inch in from the edge of the seam line of the skirt, so that it
    will not be seen when the placket is hooked up. Such stitching holds the
    facing
    more securely and prevents it from pulling out in the laundering. Apply the
    facing to the upper edge by first stitching it to the right side along the
    edge, then turning it to the wrong side and stitching it flat, as shown.</p>
  <p>To secure the skirt to the belting, turn under the upper edge and whip this
    turned edge
    to the extreme upper edge of the belting, or stitch the turned-under edge
    to the belting, first turning the skirt portion back in order not to make
the stitching evident on the right side.</p>
  <p> If you wish outside stitching at the top of the skirt, as at <em>b</em>, you may
    apply this below the upper edge a distance that is the same as the width
    of the
    stitching on the welt seam, as at <em>c</em>, or somewhat narrower than this. You
    may take this stitching merely through the turned-back portion at the upper
    edge of the skirt, as shown, or through the belting, also, the stitching
    holding the skirt securely to the belting in the laundering. Apply snap fasteners,
as shown.</p>
  <h4> <a name="tuckseam" id="tuckseam"></a>TUCK-SEAM PLACKET</h4>
  <p> 36. The <strong>tuck-seam placket</strong>, which is a form of opening
    much used in skirts that employ tuck seams, adapts itself very well to both
    wash and woolen materials.
    It is generally used on a straight seam down the center front or back of
    a skirt, but it may be employed on the edge of a panel having a tuck finish
    or when a tuck finish is used on a side gore. The method of making the tuck-seam
    placket differs somewhat in wash and wool materials, stay tapes being used
    in wash materials for the fasteners required on the opening and silk facing
    pieces being employed in woolen materials for this purpose. Both of the methods
    are given here so that you may
be prepared to make the tuck-seam placket in any sort of material.</p>
  <p> 37. <strong>Tuck-Seam Placket in Wash Material</strong>.&#8212;In order
    to avoid a break in the stitching at the termination of the placket and still
    show only a
    single row of stitching on the right side, it is advisable to finish both
    sides of the  placket before forming the tuck. For the stays that are required
    when the placket is used in wash material, use; tape or narrow, bias, seam
binding having its edges turned.</p>
  <p class="clear"><a href="illust/tsp-24.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,307);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tsp-24-t.jpg" alt="Figure 24" width="96" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>To apply the stays, stitch a piece of the tape that is a trifle longer
    than you desire the placket, over the left front of the skirt, as at <em>a</em>,
    Fig. 24, placing the tape about &frac12; inch from the front edge preferably on
    the wrong
    side of the material and extending it from the waist line. Stitch a similar
    strip to the right front of the skirt, as at <em>b</em>, applying this in
    practically the same
    manner preferably over the wrong side of the material. The reason for applying
the stays before forming the tuck seam is to prevent the stitching, as at<em> c</em>, from showing on the right side of the skirt when the tuck seam is completed.</p>
  <p> 38. Next, form the tuck for the center front by folding back the right
    front of the skirt the width of the tuck plus a generous seam allowance.
    Baste
    it the tuck width from the fold and stitch the tuck the full skirt length,
also pressing it before joining it to the left front of the skirt.</p>
  <p> In applying the stitching, be careful to stitch in a straight line and
    to make the stitching an even distance from the edge its entire
length.</p>
  <p> With the tuck stitched its full length, slip the front edge of the left
    front underneath the tuck, in order to bring the marked center-front line
    of the
    left front directly under the marked center-front line in the tuck, or right
front.</p>
  <p> With the center-front lines and the hip lines exactly matched, pin and
    baste the fronts together, taking the basting-stitches just a trifle to the
    right
    of the tuck stitching, beginning just above the lower end of the stay tapes
    and continuing to the lower edge of the skirt. This basting should hold the
    tuck to the left front, leaving the seam allowance of both fronts extending
together underneath.</p>
  <p> 39. In order to stitch the fronts together, first fold the right front
    back over the left front, as shown in Fig. 24; then, with your finger pressing
    the right front back over the stitching that secures the tuck, stitch the
    seam allowances together, as at <em>d</em>, as close to the fold as you can, but be
    very careful not to let this stitching catch the edge of the material that
is folded back.</p>
  <p> Start the stitching just above the lower edge of the stay tapes, and in
    order to make the finish secure and the tying of thread ends
    unnecessary, stitch from the inside of the seam allowance directly across
    to the outside edge, and then back over this stitching, as at e. Continue
the stitching to the skirt edge.</p>
  <p class="clear"> <a href="illust/tsp-25.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,424);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tsp-25-t.jpg" alt="Figure 25" width="130" height="202" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>40. In Fig. 25 is shown the wrong side of the completed placket. At <em>a</em>,
    a few of the stitches that secure the tuck are drawn out to illustrate the
    closeness of the two rows of stitching, one of which
    shows only on the wrong side, as at <em>b</em>, and the other on the right
    side, as at <em>c</em>. To make the inside belt, hems are stitched in the
    ends of the belting, as at <em>d</em>; then hooks are secured, as at<em> e</em>,
    and eyes, as at<em> f</em>. The upper part
    of the skirt is turned down as at <em>g</em>, and the belting applied, so that it
    comes slightly below the turned edge, as at <em>h</em>. The raw top edge in the lapping
    portion of the skirt may be covered with a narrow tape, as at <em>i</em>, secured
with fine whipping-stitches.</p>
  <p class="clear"> <a href="illust/tsp-26.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,306);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tsp-26-t.jpg" alt="Figure 26" width="95" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>41. <strong>Tuck-Seam Placket in Wool Material</strong>.&#8212;In making a tuck-seam placket
    in wool material, as shown in Fig. 26, plan to finish both edges of the placket
    separately, as in the case of wash materials, before stitching the seam.
    The first step in the making of this placket is to prepare and apply the
stay pieces.</p>
  <p class="clear"> <a href="illust/tsp-27.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,456);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tsp-27-t.jpg" alt="Figure 27" width="140" height="193" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>42. As a
    stay piece for the tuck, or upper, portion of the placket, cut a straight
    strip of facing silk about &frac12; inch longer than you wish the placket
    opening and &frac34; inch wider than the distance from the raw edge to the basted
    or marked line indicating where the tuck should be turned. Then, as a guide
    for placing the stay piece for the tuck edge of the placket, turn back the
    tuck allowance on the skirt and press it in order to crease the edge. After
    creasing, open out
the tuck, when the crease will appear on the wrong side, as at <em>a</em>, Fig. 27.</p>
  <p> Apply the stay piece by first placing it over the wrong side of the skirt
    portion so that it extends about 3/8 inch beyond the creased line underneath,
    as shown, and then basting it to the skirt material through the allowance
    that will be turned back but as close to the
    creased line as possible in order to hold the stay strip close to the tuck
    edge when it is turned. Use silk thread that matches the color of the skirt
    material for this basting and take extremely fine stitches through to the
    right side and stitches about &frac12; inch long on the facing side, as at <em>b</em>.</p>
  <p class="clear"><a href="illust/tsp-28.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,292);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tsp-28-t.jpg" alt="Figure 28" width="87" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>The stay strip is cut wide enough to form a binding for the raw edge of
    the tuck
    allowance, as at c, but before securing this in position, turn the tuck allowance
    back and press it again over the stay piece. Then, after turning the binding
    over the edge and whipping or stitching it in position, as at <em>a</em>, Fig. 28,
    stitch the tuck, as at <em>b</em>, its full length before applying it to the other
    front section of the skirt, as directed in making a tuck-seam placket in
wash material.</p>
  <p> 43. For staying the under-placket edge, cut a straight strip of facing
    silk about &frac12; inch longer than you desire the opening and
    &frac12; inch wider than the distance from the raw edge to where the tuck, or
    upper-placket portion, will lap, as indicated in Fig. 27 by a line of
basting, which was applied directly after the cutting of the skirt.</p>
  <p> Apply this by first turning under one lengthwise edge a scant &frac14; inch
    and basting it, as at <em>d</em>, Fig. 27, to the wrong side of the skirt
    about 1/8 inch
    inside of the basted line on the skirt, as at <em>e</em>, which indicates
    the point to which the tuck edge is to overlap. When you reach the lower
    end of the
    strip, turn this under, as at <em>f</em>, to produce a neat finish; then
    turn the strip over to the right side of the material to provide a finish
    for the
    raw edge; turn and baste this in position, as at <em>g</em>, Fig 27, and
    stitch it, as at <em>c</em>, Fig. 28. Stitch the other edge of the strip,
    also, as at <em>d</em> and
    whip or slip-stitch the turn at the lower end of the facing strip, as at
<em>e</em>, before joining it to the tuck edge of the placket.</p>
  <p> If the material has a smooth, fine finish that will be likely to show press
    marks, it is advisable not to
    turn the end of the facing strip, as at <em>f</em>, Fig. 27, but simply to
overcast this raw edge.</p>
  <p> 44. With both portions of the placket finished, place the tuck edge over
    the other edge of the skirt so that it is just even with the basted line
    made on the under portion, and baste these edges together. Then turn the
    right, or upper, front over on the left front and stitch the seam edges together,
    as at <em>f</em>, Fig. 28, from the lower end of the placket opening to the
    lower edge of the skirt, stitching as close to the first row of stitching
    as possible
    in the same manner as previously directed for stitching the tuck seam in
    a wash skirt or, for a somewhat softer finish, join along the seam lines
    by hand, using running-stitches with an occasional backstitch.
    Joining the edges in woolen materials by hand is, in a way, somewhat easier
    than stitching them together, for when the seam is being machine-stitched,
    extreme care is required to prevent the turned-back portion from slipping
under the needle and being caught by the stitching.</p>
  <p> In securing the two sections together, either by hand or by machine, take
    a double row of stitches across the seam allowance at the lower end of the
    placket, as at <em>g</em>, to serve as a stay and prevent the stitching from pulling
out.</p>
  <p> Apply the snap fasteners, as shown in Fig. 26, just over the stitching
    of the tuck, taking care to catch the stitches through the
stay pieces underneath but not through to the right side.</p>

  <p> 45. The <strong>habit-back placket</strong>, shown in Fig. 29, derives its name from its
    original use as a finish for the opening in the plain back of a woman's riding
    skirt,
    or habit. Besides being used for riding habits in seasons when such a finish
    is favored, it may provide the center-back opening of a fitted separate or
suit skirt.</p>
  <p> As plackets made on skirts that fit snugly at the waist and hips require
    secure fastening, hooks and eyes are used instead of snap fasteners and are
placed close together to hold the edges securely and neatly.</p>
  <p class="clear"> <a href="illust/tsp-30.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,398);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tsp-30-t.jpg" alt="Figure 30" width="118" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>46. For accurate development of the habit-back placket, a mark-stitched
    seam line, as at <em>a</em>, Fig. 30, is essential. After determining the
    placket length,
    as a rule, 8 to 11 inches measured from the waist line, stitch and finish
    the skirt seam from the lower end 
of the placket to the bottom of the skirt. Then, prepare to finish the placket.</p>
  <p> 47. <strong>Preparing the Fly and Applying the Facings</strong>.&#8212;A <em>fly</em>,
    or <em>extension</em>,
    piece is required for the underneath portion of this placket. For this, cut
    a lengthwise strip of the skirt fabric about 2 &frac12; inches wide and 1 &frac12;
    inches longer than the placket opening, and mark the
    center of the piece with basting thread, as shown at<em> b</em>. Also, cut
    a piece of facing 3/8 inch larger on all sides than the strip of material
    just prepared
    for the fly and another piece of facing the same length as the first one
and about 2 inches wide.</p>
  <p> Slip this 2-inch strip under the right-hand side of the placket opening
    with one end extending a trifle above the material and one edge well over
    the
    mark-stitched line, as at <em>c</em>; baste it in this position and then
    turn the placket edge over on the mark-stitched line and baste, so as to
    avoid stretching
    the placket edge or facing in any place. Next, turn the left-hand side
    of the placket on the
mark-stitched line, as at <em>d</em>, and baste it in position.</p>
  <p> To make the fly, place the wrong sides of the strip of material and the
    facing together; turn the facing over on each side of the strip and baste
    it in
    position, turning under the edges for a neat finish. With this done, turn
    the facing silk up over the lower end of the strip the same as on the sides
    and baste it down, taking care to finish the corners neatly and as flat as
    possible. Then, as shown at <em>e</em> and <em>f</em>, stitch around the
strip so as to hold the facing in position.</p>
  <p> 48. <strong>Stitching the Placket</strong>.&#8212;Next, adjust the gauge
    on the sewing machine so that it will give a very accurate stitched line
    the same distance from
    the edge of the placket opening as the remaining seams of the skirt are stitched
    from the edge. If no ornamental stitching is to be added to the seams on
    the right side of the skirt, then the stitching should be a generous &frac14;
    to &frac12; inch from the edge. Light-weight materials require the narrow stitching,
    while
    heavy-weight materials appear to better advantage if the stitching is placed
    in 3/8 to &frac12; inch from the edge, the gauge being adjusted to give just the
width that is desired.</p>
  <p class="clear"> <a href="illust/tsp-31.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,387);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tsp-31-t.jpg" alt="Figure 31" width="116" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>Next, carefully press the placket edges, as well as the fly piece, so that
    they will be absolutely free from wrinkles. Stitch the right side of the
    placket first, stitching from the waist line down to within 3/8 inch, or
    so, of the end of the opening, as shown in Fig. 30. At the end of the stitching,
    pull the thread through to the wrong side and fasten it. Also, turn the free
    edge of the facing back to within a scant &frac14; inch of the edge of the placket,
    as at <em>a,</em> Fig. 31, and
    press it in position, but do not whip it down. Pressing is done at this time
    merely to insure a neat finish at the bottom of the placket; that is, so
    that the end of the facing will be held down between the skirt and the fly
    portion. Later on, when the hooks are in position, the free edge of this
    facing piece is whipped down under the prongs of the hooks, as at <em>a</em>, Fig.
    29, thus covering the rings and stems of the hooks and giving a neat finish.
This also prevents wear on the threads that hold the hooks.</p>
  <p> 49. <strong>Applying the Fly</strong>.&#8212;Next, place the fly piece,
    which has been finished on two sides and one end, so that the cloth side
    is up and its center is
    exactly underneath the center of the placket opening, as shown in Fig. 30.
    Bring the placket edges together directly over the basting that marks the
    center of the fly. Then pin carefully from the bottom of the placket up to
    the waist line, and, after pinning, baste both edges to the fly portion.
    It may not seem
    necessary to baste the right-hand side, since it is stitched, but it is well
    worth while. If such basting is carefully done, it will insure a perfectly
    smooth placket, especially at the bottom, where, unless this precaution is
    taken, the material might appear drawn when the stitching is added to the
left side of the placket.</p>
  <p> When the fly is basted in position, mark diagonal lines that meet in an
    angle at the end of the placket to serve as a guide in the stitching, using
    tailor's
chalk or basting thread for marking.</p>
  <p class="clear"> <a href="illust/tsp-32.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,352);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tsp-32-t.jpg" alt="Figure 32" width="105" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>Stitch the left side of the placket next, beginning at the waist line and
    stitching down. For this work, adjust the sewing-machine gauge or quilter
    the same width as it was adjusted for the first stitching,
    so that the stitching will be the same on both sides of the placket opening.
    When you reach the bottom of the placket, turn and stitch down on the chalk
    line to the center of the placket, as at <em>b</em>, Fig. 29; then turn the work and
    stitch up to the termination of the stitching that was put in on the right-hand
    side of the placket, as at <em>c</em>. In this way, the stitching line will appear
    unbroken on the right side and, as shown in Fig. 32, on the wrong side. As
before, pull the machine threads through to the wrong side and fasten.</p>
  <p> 50. Next, remove the bastings and press the placket carefully. This is
    the most opportune time for pressing the placket, because it cannot be pressed
    well after the hooks and eyes are in position. With the exception of the
band, the placket should now appear on the wrong side as in Fig. 32.</p>
  <p> 51. <strong>Hooks and Eyes</strong>.&#8212;Mark for the hooks and eyes
    next, taking care not to stretch the edge of the placket. Place the first
    hook and eye so that
    it will come about &frac34; inch from the end. A hook and an eye are placed close
    to the lower end of the placket to prevent it from being torn out, the usual
    practice being to hook them and then press them very firmly, so that they
    will not come unhooked. The last hook and eye may come up rather close to
    the band, but this is a very good feature, for, if the skirt is inclined
    to be a little tight around the waist and the space between the hook and
eye and the edge of the band is large, the placket might gape below the band.</p>
  <p> As a rule, a No. 2 hump hook with a straight eye is satisfactory for a
    tailored placket of this kind. If the material is very light in weight, a
    No. 0 hook
    and eye may be used; but as this size is a little tedious to fasten, the
No. 1 size is preferable.</p>
  <p> 52. <strong>Applying the Hooks and Eyes</strong>.&#8212;Apply the hooks
    to the right-hand side first, placing them so that the prong of each hook
    is 1/8 inch from the
    edge of the placket and directly under the chalk mark and securing them with
    over-and-over stitches. It is not necessary to buttonhole them, as they will
    be covered with the facing; yet, the buttonhole-stitch gives strength, and
    if you can buttonhole rapidly it is well to use this stitch. In fastening
    the hooks in place, be sure to sew over the rings and underneath the prong
    of each hook, making them as secure as possible, so that none of them will
    pull out of position by the continuous fastening and unfastening to which
    they will be subjected in putting on and removing the skirt on which they
    are used. When all the hooks are in position, slip the edge of the facing
    underneath the prongs of the hooks and fell it down neatly, as previously
mentioned.</p>
  <p> Next, sew the eyes on with the buttonhole-stitch, placing the straight
    eyes directly opposite each mark on the right-hand side of the placket opening
    and straight with the edge of the placket, as shown at <em>d</em>, Fig. 29.
    For this work, use buttonhole twist that is as near the color of the material
    as possible.
    If the material is very
    dark, black buttonhole twist is usually satisfactory. In sewing the eyes
    on, you will find it well to hook up each hook and eye as the eyes are sewed
    in place, so that there will be no danger of their not hooking exactly right.
    The edges of the placket should come together in a perfectly straight line,
    as if they were a continuation of the seam; they must not appear drawn or
too full at any place. </p>
  <p>When the hooks and eyes are in position, trim the
      edges of the placket facing even with the edges of the skirt seam above
    the waist line, in preparation for applying the skirt to the band or belting.</p>
  <p> 53. <strong>Finishing the Waist Line</strong>.&#8212;The manner in which the waist line of
    a skirt may be finished with a narrow strip of lightweight silk or lining
    material so that another belt may be worn over it without causing undesirable
    bulk is shown in Fig. 31. Cut the strip for the belt of a length equal to
    the waist measurement plus the distance the placket edges overlap and an
allowance for finishing each end.</p>
  <p> To apply this strip, first baste it to the wrong side of the skirt, turn
    under the ends, as at <em>b</em>, and baste just below the edge of the tape that shows
    at <em>c</em>. This tape may be put on when the skirt is fitted and left in position
    so as to keep the band exactly the right size. When the size is correct,
    stitch the one edge of the band to the skirt, as at <em>d</em>, and then, after turning
    the band over to the right side, baste and stitch it all the way around and
overhand the ends, as at <em>e</em>.</p>
  <p> Complete the placket and the waistband finish by sewing hooks and eyes
in place.</p>
  <h4 class="clear"> <a name="inverted" id="inverted"></a><a href="illust/tsp-33.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,363);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tsp-33-t.jpg" alt="Figure 33" width="108" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>INVERTED-PLAIT PLACKET</h4>
  <p> 54. The <strong>inverted-plait placket</strong> is shown in Fig. 33. As its name implies,
    it is a placket finish used when the skirt closing is located in an inverted
    plait. It may be placed in any position where the design of the skirt calls
    for a plait of this type, whether it be at the center back, the side back,
    or the side front. In the instructions that follow, it is assumed that the
    placket is located at the center back, but the directions can be adapted
readily to any position on the skirt, provided an inverted plait is there.</p>
  <p> Though it is similar in appearance to the habit-back placket when finished,
    and also somewhat similar in construction details, the inverted-plait placket
    requires special instruction and much care in
    finishing for a good effect. The plait below the placket gives a certain
    amount of ease and fulness and thus makes this placket more generally becoming
than the habit-back type.</p>
  <p> 55. The allowance for the plait is usually made on the skirt pattern itself.
    As a rule, it is extended 3 inches beyond the center-back line at the waist
    line and twice this distance, or 6 inches, at the
    bottom. This amount, of course, is allowed on each of the back gores, so
    that the plaits will be uniform in size on each side of the center-back seam.
    In marking the pattern lines of a skirt that is to have an inverted plait,
    mark-stitch both the center-back line of the foundation skirt and the pattern
    line of the plait; then, when the skirt is basted together, the pattern lines
    of the plait become the center back of the skirt and the edges of the plait
form the placket edges, which meet directly over the center-back seam.</p>
  <p class="clear"> <a href="illust/tsp-34.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,546);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tsp-34-t.jpg" alt="Figure 34" width="140" height="160" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>56. <strong>Preparing for Making the Placket</strong>.&#8212;To prepare
    for the inverted-plait placket, baste and stitch the center-back seam of
    the skirt, which is the
    plait extension, from 
    the waist line to the bottom of the skirt, and bind or overcast each edge.
    Then press the seam open, and on the right side of the center-back seam,
    exactly half way between the seam and the mark-stitched line, cut the material
    down from the waist line at this half-way point, making the slash as deep
    as the placket itself is to be, usually 11 inches for a skirt that is fitted
    closely. Fig. 34 shows where the slash should be made, but as this illustrates
    the wrong side of the skirt, the slash is naturally at the left of the wrong
side of the seam.</p>
  <p> 57. <strong>Applying the Facing Strips</strong>.&#8212;To make the inverted-plait
    placket, first cut two lengthwise strips of facing silk, making one of them
    about
    2 &frac12; inches wide and the other 2 inches wide, and each strip 1 inch longer
    than the placket opening. Place the right side of the narrower, or 2-inch,
    strip to the right side of the cloth on the right-hand side of the placket
    with the raw edges even, and-baste and stitch it to the edge, turning it
    up at the end before stitching. Then turn the facing back to the wrong side
    of the placket and 
    baste it down, as at <em>a</em>, Fig. 34, leaving a scant &frac14; inch of the
    facing showing on the right side. Then turn and baste the edge of the facing
    just
    over the
    line of the mark-stitches, as at <em>b</em>, in order to give a good, firm edge over
which to turn the plait.</p>
  <p> Next, join the 2&frac12;-inch piece to the opposite side of the placket in
    a similar manner. Then turn the strip over to the wrong side so that it just
    meets
    the raw edge of the skirt, and baste it, as at <em>c</em>; crease it in the
    center and then turn it back on the skirt material and baste it again on
    the edge,
    as at <em>d</em>. Turning the facing under in this way, thus making it double,
    produces a strong enough stay to hold the eyes in position at the lower end
    of the opening. Having turned back the lower end of the facing before stitching,
    secure these turned
    edges to the skirt with hemming-stitches. Then stitch the facing strips along
    the edges from the right side, as at a and b, Fig. 35, and afterwards take
    a few overhanding-stitches to hold the edges together at the end of the placket
and prevent this from tearing down.</p>
  <p> 58. With these edges stitched, press the placket facings from the wrong
    side, so as to have them smooth and straight. Next, if
    the material is not very firm, baste a lengthwise strip of facing silk or
    seam binding a trifle longer than the depth you desire the outside stitching
    of the placket and &frac12; or &frac34; inch wide, to the wrong side of the skirt,
    along the mark-stitched line or plait edge to the left of the opening. This
    strip
    serves as a stay for one bias edge of the inverted plait and prevents it
    from stretching or sagging down. The facing strip for the opening serves
    this same purpose in the right-plait edge. Then turn the plait on the mark-stitched
    line back over the stay strip, turning from the right side, and baste it
    on this line all the way to the bottom of the skirt. The plait is basted
the full length of the skirt to insure a true line.</p>
  <p> When the edges of the plait are basted, bring them over and pin them in
    position, taking care to have their edges meet exactly over the seam and
    to baste very
    smoothly. In doing this basting, place the work on the sewing table, so that
    the weight of the skirt will not pull the plait out of position. First, determine
    the exact length that the placket is to be and mark it accordingly with tailor's
    chalk straight across from one edge to the other. Then baste from the termination
    of the placket to the bottom of the skirt on each edge, and on the left-hand
    side from the waist line down the entire length, basting through all thicknesses
    but taking care not to catch the stitches through to the front part of the
skirt.</p>
  <p class="clear"> <a href="illust/tsp-35.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,529);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tsp-35-t.jpg" alt="Figure 35" width="140" height="173" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>59. <strong>Stitching the Plaits</strong>.&#8212;Next, prepare to stitch the edges of the
    plaits. If the skirt is part of a suit, or if the other seams are stitched
    in welt or open-welt effect, the stitching on the edges of the inverted plait
    should correspond with the other plaits or seam stitching. After determining
    the distance that the stitching is to extend from the waist line, mark it
    as already explained for the placket length&#8212;in this case, about two-thirds
    the length of the placket&#8212; and stitch the right-hand side first, as
shown at <em>c</em>, Fig. 35, stitching from the waist line down.</p>
  <p> As has been mentioned, for very stout figures it is well not to extend
    this stitching the full length of the placket, so as to give more freedom
    over
    the largest part of the hips. For very slender figures, the stitching may
    extend farther down on the placket; but, in any case, it is best to make
    this stitching a little shorter than the placket, as such stitching gives
a neater finish.</p>
  <p> In terminating the stitching, as at <em>d</em>, you may run it diagonally upward
    or downward, as desired. Whichever plan you follow, mark the turn on both
    sides
    of the plait with tailor's chalk, so that the stitching on each side will
    correspond. Stitch through only the edge of the plait, as shown, pull the
    threads through on the inside of the plait, and fasten them securely. Next,
    stitch the left side of the placket, as at <em>e</em>. This side is stitched in the
    same manner as the right side, except that the plait is stitched to the skirt
itself.</p>
  <p> 60. <strong>Applying the Hooks and Eyes</strong>.&#8212;With the stitching
    done, press the placket very carefully. Then place hooks on the
    right-hand side and eyes to correspond along the left-hand edge of the placket,
    as at <em>g</em>. In securing these fastenings in place, sew through the
    center-back seam of the skirt; this will give strength and prevent them from
    pulling
    away from the skirt material. As you will observe on referring to Fig. 35,
    the hooks and eyes at the lower end of the placket are placed midway of the
    portion used as the fly. This plan is an excellent one, as the fasteners
    keep the
    placket in position and yet permit the plait to be open enough to allow for
    freedom at the bottom of the placket. Take the stitches to secure these lower
    hooks and eyes through the facing pieces as well as through the skirt material.
    Then, to prevent the bottom of the plait from tearing out at its lower edge
    and also to keep the placket in position, clasp the bottom hook and the eye,
    which are designated by<em> h</em>, and press them very firmly with an iron so that
they cannot be unhooked.</p>
  <p> 61. <strong>Finishing the Waist Line</strong>.&#8212;With the fastenings
    applied to the placket edge, finish the waist line in a manner suitable for
    the style of skirt you
    are making. The
    illustrations of the inverted-plait placket here discussed show a band of
    the skirt material with a lining of facing silk. The band is applied in the
    same manner as any other band, except that the two kinds of material are
    used and joined in a seam at the upper edge of the band, as shown in Fig.
35.</p>
  <p class="clear"> <a href="illust/tsp-36.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',1220,705);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/tsp-36-t.jpg" alt="Figure 36" width="114" height="211" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>Sew the hooks and eyes on the band as in the habit-back placket. Then,
    when the placket is fastened up and in position, the wrong si3e will appear
    as
  shown in Fig. 36, and the right side as in Fig. 33.</p>
  <h4 class="clear"> <a name="location" id="location"></a>LOCATION OF PLACKET OPENINGS</h4>
  <p> 62. Some designers say that when designing a garment they never consider
          the place where a dress or skirt will be opened. They get the desired
          style effect and then plan for an opening afterwards, placing it where
          it will
          in nowise affect line or trimming. This is a good point to remember
    in the placing of plackets. Also, unless an opening is to be made a trimming
          feature,
          it should be as inconspicuous as possible, and as few or as many fasteners
          used as the looseness or the tightness of the garment requires.</p>
  <p> Sometimes, good workmen will use but one or two snap fasteners on a
            placket and perhaps put just a narrow strip of silk as a stay strip
            underneath,
            overcast the edges rather than bind them and make the entire opening
            in such a way
            that you would need to look carefully to find it.</p>
  <p> And so there are two responsibilities in making openings in garments;
              first, to know how to make all kinds correctly; then, to know when
              to use them
              properly in accordance with Fashion's demands.</p>

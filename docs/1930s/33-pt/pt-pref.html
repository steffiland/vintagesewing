<h1> 1933&#8212;Principles of Tailoring<span class="small"><em><br />
Woman's Institute of Domestic Arts &amp; Sciences</em>, by Mary Brooks Picken</span></h1>
<h2> PREFACE</h2>
<p> Time was when the word <em>tailoring</em> called to mind heavy, woolen materials
  and heavy-appearing seams and finishes. But today, silks, lawns, dimities,
  and
      even voiles and Georgettes, have tailored seams and edges, so that tailoring,
as it is known now, is one of the vital parts of dressmaking.</p>
<p> This book treats of the subject of tailoring in its broad, present-day
        meaning. Covering first the equipment necessary for good tailoring and
        the way to sponge
      materials that are to be made up into tailored garments, it then proceeds
        to the making of seams and plackets. So much of the success of a tailored
        garment
      depends on the perfection of its seaming and openings that too much stress
      cannot be laid on the importance of this part of tailoring.</p>
<p> The next Section deals with buttonholes, buttons, and trimmings that are
        suitable for many materials and garments. The making of tailored buttonholes
        can become
        as significant a task as building a brick wall or shingling a roof or
  building a fortress. Each stitch, as with stones or shingles, is placed for
  permanent
        security. It has its definite place and must fit in against the others
        with ease and accuracy in order that a serviceable buttonhole may result.</p>
<p> A very important step in the development of a tailored garment is the
          making of its pockets. This embodies a definite feeling of responsibility
          because
          of the fact that a slash must be made in the garment as a part of the
          construction of the pocket, and once the fabric has been cut, a final
          step has been
          taken. Painstaking care, therefore, is necessary, and the instruction
          given on all
          types of pocket making keeps this point uppermost at all times. Step
          by step the various processes are accurately given. If each step is
  thoroughly mastered
          and understood before going on to the next, the finished appearance
  of the pocket will be proof of the value of the thoughtful care you put
          into
          its
          construction.</p>
<p> In presenting these various details of tailoring,definiteness and precision
            are constantly stressed. Puckered ruffles may be permissible, 
  but tailored stitching must travel as straight as an arrow, tailored
            plackets must fasten so perfectly that there is never the hint of
            a bulge, tailored
            buttonholes must be exact as to cut and workmanship, and tailored
            pockets must display absolute accuracy and neatness. The first step
            to success
            is a full
            appreciation of how much these details add to tailored garments and
            the next is the willingness to spare no effort toward the careful
            working out of each.</p>

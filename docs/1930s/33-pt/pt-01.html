<h3>    <a name="scope" id="scope"></a>SCOPE OF TAILORING</h3>
  <p> 1. <strong>What is Tailoring?</strong>&#8212;Tailoring is one of the foremost of the sewing
    arts, because more than two-thirds of the garments worn require some form
    of tailoring. It really is a recognized trade followed by many hundreds of
    people, men especially. Time, patience, and a knowledge of both garment construction
and materials are essential in one's training for tailoring.</p>
  <p> Until about a half century ago, many materials were of a very heavy quality,
    so that much care had to be given to their assembling, basting, steaming,
    and pressing to obtain good-looking results. Today, with the weaver's art
    so perfected that exquisite fabrics are offered on all sides, very inexpensively
    priced in proportion to quality, the responsibility is reversed. Now, one
    needs not so much to beautify the fabric by careful sewing as to do justice
    to its beauty by sewing it as perfectly as possible. When much sewing, basting,
    and pressing, especially machine sewing, must be done, the work properly
comes under the head of tailoring&#8212;a word frequently misunderstood.</p>
  <p> Many persons, in thinking of tailoring, think only of suits with padding
    and heavy seams, braid-trimmed skirts, and linings throughout. But today,
    one tailors a silk, machine-made blouse, a sports skirt, or a simple frock
    of linen or flannel. Sheer materials, fine silks, and laces are generally
    reserved for lingerie sewing or dressmaking, but all other moderately firm
    fabrics that require the friendship of sponge cloth and iron and that demand
    basting and straight, perfect stitching, may safely be classed with tailoring
materials.</p>
  <p> 2. <strong>Necessity for Good Equipment</strong>.&#8212;Making tailored garments is often
    regarded a much more difficult task than making fluffy, frilly ones, but
    this is not necessarily the case. True, tailoring is not of the sewing-basket
    variety. One must spread all pieces out on a flat surface, cut all seam edges
    neatly, join all edges accurately, and baste with a definite precision. But
    none of these is a difficult process nor requires any more effort than work
on lingerie garments, particularly if the right sort of equipment is chosen.</p>
  <p> In addition to the special equipment mentioned later, be sure to have a
    cutting board or table, on which both cutting and basting may be done; a
    firm, well-padded
    ironing board; shears that are sharp; and a machine that is well regulated
    as to stitch, an elastic, medium-long stitch proving best, because tailoring
    materials are usually fairly heavy and by their thickness shorten the stitch
    somewhat. Also, have your brush (a substantial clothes brush is satisfactory,
    or a tailor's brush is even more desirable) washed and kept perfectly clean
    for lifting the nap on fabrics when, by accident, it is pressed too flat
    with too hot an iron. Number 7 or 8 sewing needles are usually best for tailoring.
Silk or mercerized cotton thread should be used for tailoring.</p>
  <p> 3. <strong>Requisites of Good Tailoring</strong>.&#8212;In tailoring, very
    accurate patterns are almost a necessity, for in materials that are even
    slightly heavy, perfect
    seams are necessary. Irregular seams might go unnoticed in a voile dress
    that is full and easy, but in a linen dress, because of its very plainness,
a jagged or an uneven seam will spoil the whole appearance.</p>
  <p> A good tailor always sponges and shrinks his material, so that the seams
    of the garment will not shrink unevenly in the process of making nor spot
    or shrink from dampness when it is worn. Of course, all woolen materials
    are shrunk, or sponged, in the process of manufacture; nevertheless, in spite
    of the fact that merchants in some cases insist that certain materials do
    not have to be treated in this manner, it is advisable to do so, -because
    materials that are kept in stock become relaxed and need to be responged
    to be in condition for cutting. In the large cities, it is possible to have
    the cloth shrunk by the merchant from whom it is purchased, usually at a
    small additional cost per yard; but in the smaller cities and towns, the
    stores, as a rule, are not equipped to carry on such work, and it must of
necessity be done at home.</p>
  <p> 4. With the material shrunk and the perfection of his pattern determined,
    a tailor marks each side exactly alike so that the pattern pieces will go
    together perfectly. Next, he bastes with as much care as though the garment
    were to be made by hand. Before he starts to stitch, he tries a scrap of
    two thicknesses of material under the presser foot to satisfy himself that
    the machine is free of dripping oil, that the stitch is easy and of the right
    length, that the tension is free enough, that the machine -needle is smooth
    and perfect at its point, and that the needle itself is correctly set. With
    these precautions, neat satisfying work is sure to result and a pride be
developed that will make tailoring a real joy and inspiration.</p>
  <h3> <a name="equipment" id="equipment"></a>TAILORING EQUIPMENT</h3>
  <p> 5. So that the best results may be obtained in the development of tailored
    garments, a certain amount of equipment is necessary. As many of these articles
    are in common use in the home, first see what equipment you have on hand
    that may be utilized, and then provide as much new equipment as you consider
    essential for your purpose. The various kinds of tailoring equipment are
    considered here, for even though some of these are not an actual necessity
    for home use, all are a decided convenience. Then, too, it is important that
    you gain a very clear understanding of their appearance and use so that if
    you are ever called upon to do such work you will be familiar with all the
equipment.</p>
  <p> <a name="sponge" id="sponge"></a>6. <strong>Sponge and Press Cloths</strong>.&#8212;If you intend to do
    much pressing, you will find one sponge or, better still, a medium-size sponge
    and two press cloths, a convenience. These cloths should be used for no other
purpose than sponging and pressing materials and garments in the making.</p>
  <p> Firm, unbleached muslin or light-weight duck or drilling is suitable for
    <em>sponge cloths</em>, &frac14; to &frac12; yard of this being sufficient for each
    one. Take the precaution not to have the <em>press cloths</em> linty nor
    too sheer. For
    each <em>press
    cloth</em>, provide about 1&frac12; yards of unbleached muslin; It is not necessary
    to hem any of these pieces, but, if you wish, you may pink or overcast the
    raw
edges to prevent them from raveling.</p>
  <p> 7. In order to remove the filling that is put in when the material is woven,
    boil the cloths before using them in fairly strong 
    soapsuds to which a pinch of baking soda has been added. This precaution
    should always be taken, because new muslin scorches readily and because it
    is almost impossible for the new material to absorb sufficient water to be
of any service in sponging if the filling is not removed.</p>
  <p> <a name="brushes" id="brushes"></a>8. <strong>Brushes</strong>.&#8212;In sponging and pressing materials,
    and especially in dampening the press cloths, to avoid making them too wet,
    you will find a <em>small
    brush</em>    invaluable. This may be of the type commonly used for cleaning
    vegetables, one about 4 inches long and 2 inches wide, with strong bristles
    &frac12; to &frac34; inch
    long and an, unvarnished back that may be washed, being suitable. Such brushes
are very inexpensive and will last indefinitely.</p>
  <p> 9. Another desirable article is a <em>tailor's brush</em>, which is a heavy brush
    with a long handle and a flat top. It is useful in both pressing and steaming
    garments, the back of it to beat down heavy seams or any thick places and
    the bristles to aid in sending steam through the material and keeping its
    nap up. Such brushes may be purchased in any tailors' supply house. The wooden
    part of the brush must be unfinished, or unvarnished, however; if it is varnished,
    there is always danger of ruining garments on which it is used because of
    the fact that the steam generated in pressing and steaming garments will
soften the varnish.</p>
  <p> 10. An ordinary <em>whisk broom</em>, too, should be on hand for this work, as it
    is valuable for raising the nap of material when steaming garments if something
    stiffer than a brush is required. It is useful, also, in pressing materials
    that have a very long nap, as such nap must always be brushed straight before
pressing.</p>
  <p> <a name="irons" id="irons"></a>11. <strong>Irons</strong>.&#8212;In order to obtain the best results in the pressing of woolen
    materials, a heavy iron is essential. As a rule, the <em>flat irons</em> used in the
    home come in sets of three; it is the heaviest of these three that is most
    suitable for such work. A medium-sized or large <em>electric iron</em>, the kind commonly
    in use in the home, because of its weight, is even better for tailoring than
an ordinary flat iron.</p>
  <p> 12. An iron much heavier than an ordinary flat iron and known as a <em>tailor's
    goose</em> is considered a necessity in tailoring establishments. This may be
had in weights ranging from 16 to 24 pounds.</p>
  <p> <a name="board" id="board"></a>13. <strong>Ironing Board</strong>.&#8212;For pressing and sponging, or shrinking, woolen
    materials, a smooth, well-padded <em>ironing board</em> of good size is an absolute
    necessity; that is, one at least 5 feet long and 12 to 14 inches wide, so
that it will accommodate practically any skirt.</p>
  <p> Many persons are of the opinion that an ironing board requires but little
    padding; such is not the case, however, for to get the best results sufficient
    padding should be used to give a firm, smooth surface. Light-colored, worn
    woolen blankets make the best padding for an ironing board, especially a
    board on which woolen materials are to be pressed, because the wool has a
    tendency to &quot;give&quot; under the material that is being pressed, thus
    making possible a softer, smoother-pressed finish than would otherwise be
    the case. If wool for padding is not procurable, a worn cotton blanket may
    be used, or, if desired, very heavy flannelette may be purchased for the
    purpose. The chief essential is to have each thickness of padding in one
    piece, so as to avoid seams or ridges on the padded board. As a rule, the
padding should be from &frac14; to 3/8 inches thick.</p>
  <p> The covering for an ironing board should be made of unbleached muslin of
    a medium quality. New muslin that has been washed is best, because it has
    very little lint. Old sheets make an excellent covering for an ironing board
    on which light-colored wash garments are to be ironed and pressed, but a
    covering with any sign of lint should always be avoided where dark materials,
especially woolens, are to be pressed.</p>
  <p> 14. Small holders for stretching and keeping in place both the padding
    and the covering of an ironing board may be purchased in sets of four or
    six
    at a very low cost. These holders are excellent for stretching out every
    wrinkle and for holding the padding permanently in place. However, if they
cannot be procured, the board may be padded and covered as follows:</p>
  <p> Stretch both the padding and the covering over the board, one at a time,
    just as tight as possible, and tack them in place on the underneath side,
    placing a tack every 2 or 3 inches so as to make sure of holding the material
    in place. To get the best results in the covering of a board, the padding
    and the covering should be at least 2 or 3 inches larger in every way than
    the top of the ironing board. Begin by tacking the middle of the pieces of
    material to the middle of the board; that is, the center of each end and
    the center of each edge. Tack, first, one end; then draw the material across
    tight and tack 
    the other end; next, tack one edge and then the other, drawing the covering
    and padding materials tight in each instance. Next, draw the corners of the
    material to their respective corners and tack them in place, stretching the
    materials well along the lines leading to the middle tacks. With this done,
    fasten the rest of the padding in place, putting tacks between those already
    in place. This method obviates the gathering of fulness at any point, which
would result in wrinkles otherwise impossible to work out.</p>
  <p> 15. <strong>Sleeve Board</strong>.&#8212;After the seams of a sleeve of woolen or of silk
    material have been joined, it is difficult to press them open without considerable
    care and effort or to press the sleeve satisfactorily in its entirety without
the use of a sleeve board.</p>
  <p> A sleeve board should be padded and covered in practically the same manner
    as an ironing board. It should be slender and on a substantial stand, if
possible.</p>
  <p> <a name="edge" id="edge"></a>16. <strong>Edge and Seam Pressers</strong>.&#8212;An <em>edge press block</em>,
    which consists of a piece of hard wood, &frac34; to 1 inch in thickness, mounted
    edgewise on a stand
    and pointed at each end, is a great convenience for the pressing open of
    the seam that joins the facing to a coat. This board is used without padding.
    The pointed ends make it possible to push the board well up into the corners
    of the revers and thus permit a tailored effect that it is difficult to obtain
otherwise.</p>
  <p> For home tailoring, a thin piece of hard wood may be substituted for the
    edge press block. Cut this &frac34; to 1 inch wide, point it at the ends, and
sand paper it until it is perfectly smooth.</p>
  <p> 17. A <em>covered broom stick</em> may be used to excellent advantage in the pressing
    of seams, especially in materials that require unusual care in handling in
    order to prevent them from becoming shiny. With the seam laid over the curved
    surface of the broom stick, it is possible to press only the center of the
    seam and prevent the outer seam edges from forming a ridge or shiny line
on the right side of the fabric.</p>
  <p> To prepare a broom stick for a seam presser, pad it with a thin layer of
    cotton or wind it with soft rags, being careful to distribute the thickness
    very evenly; then cover the padding with muslin, stretching this as tight
    as possible, and whip one turned edge over the other edge so as to secure
it.</p>
  <p> 18. A <em>velvet presser</em>, which is a device consisting of a board set with
    firm, fine, wire projections, or teeth, closely laid, makes it possible to
    press
    velvet or other napped fabrics without flattening the pile and makes unnecessary
the steaming method that must otherwise be employed.</p>
  <p> To use such a presser, place the fabric, face down, on the presser, so
    that the nap is downward on the teeth of the presser. Then put a slightly
    dampened
    cloth on the back of the fabric and press it with a medium-hot iron. This
    pressing will send the steam through the pile and raise it and, at the same
time, remove any wrinkles in the velvet.</p>
  <p class="clear"><a href="illust/et-01.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',327,668);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/et-01-t.jpg" alt="Figure 1" width="200" height="95" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a> <a name="ham" id="ham"></a>19. <strong>Ham Cushion</strong>.&#8212;For the pressing of curved seams,
    such as the bust and shoulder seams of coats and dresses and the hip seams
    of coats and skirts,
    there is perhaps no better device than what is commonly known by tailors
    as a <em>ham cushion</em>; in fact, no custom-tailoring establishment is
    complete without one. Such a cushion, which is illustrated in Fig. 1, consists
    simply
    of a covering 
    of white tailors' felt carefully stuffed with rags. Ham cushions can be purchased
    in tailors' supply houses, but a cushion that will prove to be just as serviceable
and much less expensive can be made in the home.</p>
  <p> 20. For a ham cushion, purchase at a tailors' supply house 5/8 yard of
    36-inch white tailors' felt. Such felt, which is made up and sold especially
    for
    this purpose, is very durable and firm and will give the best possible service.
    The small pieces of felt that remain after cutting out the covering need
    not be wasted, for they can be used to make a cushion one-fourth as large
    as the other, which will be found very useful as it can be used inside of
    sleeves, under the armhole seam, and in many places where the large one might
    be too large or too unhandy. In addition to the felt, provide sufficient
    heavy muslin or galatea for an interlining and enough clean, old woolen rags
    for stuffing. Rags from old woolen shirts, coats, or blankets are satisfactory,
provided all hard spots are removed.</p>
  <p class="clear"> <a href="illust/et-02.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',327,796);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/et-02-t.jpg" alt="Figure 2" width="200" height="89" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>21. In order to cut out the covering and the interlining for a ham cushion,
    develop a pattern in the manner shown in Fig. 2, as 
    follows: Fold lengthwise through the center a piece of paper that is 14 inches
    wide and 21 inches long, and, then, with the folded edge next to you, locate
    the necessary points for outlining the pattern. Locate point <em>A</em> 1
    inch from the right edge of the paper; point <em>B</em> 19 inches to the
    left of <em>A</em> on the fold;
    point <em>C</em> 6 inches directly 
    above <em>B</em>; and point <em>D</em> 6 inches directly above <em>A</em>.
    Then draw lines from <em>A</em> to
    <em>D</em>, from <em>C</em> to <em>B</em>, and from <em>D</em> to <em>C</em>.
    To locate points to be used as an aid in drawing the curves, place point <em>B</em><span class="small">2
    1</span> &frac12; inches
    above <em>B</em> on line <em>BC</em>; point <em>A<span class="small">2</span></em> 1 inch above <em>A</em> on line <em>AD</em>; point <em>E</em> midway between
    <em>C </em>and <em>D</em>; and point <em>E<span class="small">2</span></em> 2 inches to the left of<em> E</em>. Then connect <em>B<span class="small">2</span></em> and<em> E<span class="small">2</span>,</em>    as well as <em>E</em> and <em>A<span class="small">2</span></em>, with a well-curved line, as shown in the illustration,
being careful to avoid forming points at <em>B<span class="small">2</span></em>, <em>E<span class="small">2</span></em>, E, and <em>A<span class="small">2</span></em>.</p>
  <p> To form the pattern, which, when cut out, should be egg-shaped, cut through
both thicknesses of paper, from <em>B</em> through <em>B<span class="small">2</span></em> to <em>E<span class="small">2</span></em>, and from <em>E<span class="small">2</span></em> through <em>E</em>    and <em>A<span class="small">2</span></em> to <em>A</em>.</p>
  <p> 22. When the pattern is cut out, place the lengthwise center on a double
    thickness of the felt folded to produce a true bias and cut out the cushion
    covering. Cutting the material on the true bias will enable you to shape
    the cushion more easily. Do not allow for seams, as the edges of the felt
    must be whipped together, as shown in Fig. 1. Also cut out the interlining,
using the same pattern, but allowing 3/8-inch seams on all edges.</p>
  <p> With the material cut out, the next process will be to seam the interlining
    together with the exception of a small opening to admit the filling, and
    then prepare the filling. To make the filling, tear and cut into small pieces
    old woolen rags that are free from hard seams, and dampen these bits of material
    a trifle so that they will pack very tight. Then proceed to stuff them into
    the interlining, being careful to pack the rags even and close, so that the
    outside will be smooth and firm. After making sure that the interlining is
    stuffed as full as possible and will keep its shape, close the opening of
the interlining with diagonal basting and then overhand it closely.</p>
  <p> With the interlining thus prepared, place the felt over it, and then, drawing
    the edges together, overhand them closely, keeping the surface absolutely
    smooth and as tight as possible. Put such a cushion, after making, in the
    sun, near the stove or on a radiator so that the rags that have been dampened
    may become thoroughly dry. Of course, if the cushion is put into use at once,
the heat from the iron will dry it sufficiently.</p>
  <p class="clear"><a href="illust/et-03.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',273,650);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/et-03-t.jpg" alt="Figure 3" width="220" height="88" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a> <a name="cheese" id="cheese"></a>23. <strong>Cheese Block</strong>.&#8212;When it is desired to press seams
    very flat and hard or to make them scarcely visible, it is well to use a
    
    press block, commonly called a <em>cheese block</em>, one style of which
    is shown in Fig. 3. Such a block consists of a piece of 3-inch oak that measures
    18
    inches on the straight side and 14 inches across, 
    and is covered with two thicknesses of tailors' felt stretched just as tight
as possible and tacked in place on the block, as shown.</p>
  <p class="clear"><a href="illust/et-04.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',385,852);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/et-04-t.jpg" alt="Figure 4" width="220" height="105" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a> <a name="stand" id="stand"></a>24. <strong>Tailors' Press Stand</strong>.&#8212;Another device used in
    pressing tailored work is the <em>tailors' press stand</em> shown in Fig.
    4. Such a stand may be made to take the place of a ham cushion, and as it
    has 
    a sleeve board attached, as at <em>a</em>, it has a double utility value.
    A tailors' press stand is usually 28 inches long, 7 inches high, and 10 inches
    wide.
    However, if expense 
    must be considered, the ham cushion in connection with a regulation sleeve
board will give perfectly satisfactory service.</p>
  <p> <a name="pinking" id="pinking"></a>25. <strong>Pinking Machine or Scissors</strong>.&#8212;Pinking, which consists of a series
    of notches or small scallops in plain or fancy effects, is sometimes used
    for finishing seam edges or as a trimming for the edges of ruffles. It is
    done by means of specially constructed scissors or a small hand machine.
    Either of these devices will be a time saver in the workroom, for the finish
    they produce will be a satisfactory substitute for overcasting or binding
on material that is firm enough not to ravel to any great extent.</p>
  <p> 26. The <em>pinking machine</em> is usually provided with two or three
    blades for variety, one for cutting a small notch, one for cutting; medium-sized
    notch,
    and
    another for cutting a fancy notch. It may be operated simply and quickly
according to directions that accompany it.</p>
  <p> 27. The <em>pinking scissors</em> are of a specially constructed type having
    serrated edges. The advantage of them is that they will cut and finish the
    seam edge
    in one operation. So they not only produce ar attractive finish but they
save considerable time as well.</p>
  <h3> <a name="shrinking" id="shrinking"></a>SHRINKING WOOLEN MATERIALS</h3>
  <p> 28. <strong>Nature of Shrinking</strong>.&#8212;Because of the severe pressing
    that is so important in tailoring, the materials used for tailored garments,
    when they
    are of wool, must usually be prepared to take this treatment so that when,
    later on, water is used as an aid in pressing the fabric, there will be no
    blistering, spotting, or shrinking after the pressing has been done. The
    preparation, which generally consists of a dampening and drying process,
is known as <em>shrinking</em>.</p>
  <p> 29. <strong>Equipment for Shrinking</strong>.&#8212;Two shrinking cloths, each at least 32
    inches wide and 4 yards long, are needed for one method of shrinking. Unbleached
    muslin that has been boiled in a strong soap solution and then rinsed thoroughly
    to remove all dressing, is most satisfactory. However, partly worn sheets
can also be used.</p>
  <p> For another method, a roller, which can be purchased at tailors' supply
    stores, is needed. Or, a thin board with rounded edges, about 10 inches wide
    and
    30 inches long, makes a good substitute. Cover either one with muslin, which
    has been washed, rinsed, and dried, and whip the ends and edges together
to make a smooth, flat surface.</p>
  <p> 30. <strong>Shrinking Methods</strong>.&#8212;The simplest method of shrinking
    material consists of placing it between wet sponge cloths until dry. First,
    clip the selvage
    edges of the material to be shrunk, every 1 to 1&frac12; inches so that they
    will shrink evenly with the rest of the fabric. For protection, place several
    thicknesses of newspaper on your cutting table or the floor, and over it
    spread one of your sponge cloths, thoroughly and evenly moistened, smoothing
    it out carefully so that there will be no wrinkles. Spread the material over
    the wet cloth, smoothing it down too. Then, spread the second wet cloth over
    the wool, patting it down carefully over its entire length so that it will
    be 
    close to the material to be shrunken. Allow to remain without shifting or
    moving until thoroughly dry, usually over night. If each step of the work
has been properly done, no pressing will be needed.</p>
  <p> 31. Another method uses a roller or board and one sponge cloth. Dampen
    the sponge cloth, spread it out smoothly, spread your material, folded double,
    over it, and, placing the roller or board evenly at one end, roll over it
    the material and the sponge cloth, keeping both entirely smooth. Let stand
    for 4 to 6 hours. Then unroll, remove the muslin, and spread the material
    out to dry on a table or hang it over the top of a door that has been covered
    with several thicknesses of newspapers. If it should contain any wrinkles,
    press these out, using a slightly dampened press cloth over the wrong side
    of the material and a moderately hot iron and pressing lightly with the warp
threads to avoid stretching.</p>
  <p> 32. Still another method, often used for materials with a glossy surface
    like broadcloth, consists merely of dampening and pressing them. Place the
    material right side down on an ironing board, lay a well-dampened press cloth
    over it, and run a hot iron over the muslin several times. Remove the muslin
and press the material dry.</p>
  <p> 33. <strong>Wool Materials Not Requiring Sponging</strong>.&#8212;Many modern makers of wool
    fabrics take care of their sponging during the manufacturing process. Therefore,
    when you purchase dress material, coatings, or suitings of wool, find out
    whether this precaution has been taken. A tag which states that the material
    has been sponged or shrunk, usually accompanies it. Shrinking of very crepy
    wool fabrics should also be avoided, for the twisted threads that go to make
    up such weaves do not lend themselves satisfactorily to the shrinking process.
    Very sheer wool fabrics, because of their fineness, do not require dampening
    before pressing, so sponging or shrinking will be unnecessary. So, before
making up materials, shrink only those materials that need it.</p>
  <h3> PRESSING WOOLEN MATERIALS</h3>
  <p> 34. A knowledge of how materials should be pressed is very important to
    the person who sews, for, if the work is done right, pressing should always
    follow
    every step in the construction of all tailored garments, and especially in
    the case of woolen ones. Pressing not only improves the fit of the finished
    garments, but adds much to their 
    finished effect. And, if pains are taken in the pressing of the seams, corners,
    and curves during the making, very little pressing will be needed when the
garment is completed.</p>
  <p> In pressing woolen materials, the iron should be hot, but not sufficiently
    hot to scorch. And it should be remembered that wool scorches more readily
    than cotton. Even though the press cloth is always between the material and
    the iron, the hard pressing that is usually necessary causes the heat to
penetrate readily to the material.</p>
  <p> 35. To press woolen material, lay it smooth on the ironing board, first
    brushing the nap, if there is one, straight with a whisk broom. Beat any
    extra-heavy
    seam or thickness with the back of a tailor's brush. Then lay a dampened
    press cloth over the part to be pressed, and run the hot iron over it, using
    a rotary motion until it is thoroughly pressed. Never permit the iron to
    rest in one place very long at a time as this will cause iron prints to form
    on the material. Also, never push or drag the iron over the material. Rather,
    lift it carefully from one part to another so as to prevent wrinkling of
    the material or pulling it or the garment out of shape. When you desire to
    change the press cloth, be sure to place the iron on a holder stand so that
    you may have both of your hands to make the change and there will be no danger
of burning the material.</p>
  <p> 36. <strong>Removing Shine</strong>.&#8212;Sometimes, in the construction of woolen garments,
    certain parts, especially seams and overlapping edges, become shiny or glossy
    from improper pressing. Also, as is well known, a woolen material that consists
    of hard or firmly twisted threads is likely to become glossy from hard wear.
    To remove the shine, first place over it a press cloth that is slightly damper
    than one needed for ordinary pressing. Then hold a hot iron very close to
    the press cloth, but not on it, keeping the iron in one position long enough
    to allow the steam an opportunity to penetrate the fabric. Then lift the
    press cloth and brush the fabric briskly to roughen its surface a trifle
in order to take away the shine.</p>
  <p> Repeat this process until every trace of the shine is removed. Then, dry
      the steamed material thoroughly, holding the iron close enough to the press
      cloth so that the fabric will appear to have been carefully pressed, although
  the iron has not touched it.</p>

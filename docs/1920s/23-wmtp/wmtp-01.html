  <h3>    Remarks</h3>
  <p>    1. From time immemorial woolen materials have been the mainstay in garment construction. From the days long before the homespun of our forefathers to the present day of weaves of every description, fabrics made of wool have not been surpassed in practicability for garments intended to give warmth and at the same time be stylish and durable. Of course, before the weaving of fabrics from wool was taken up as a commercial enterprise, the designs, weaves, and colorings were few. The people of the olden days, it is true, were adept in weaving and dyeing, but it remained for the textile manufacturer to bring out in a practical way the various weaves, colorings, finishes, and effects that give to the woman who sews an excellent assortment of woolen fabrics from which to create pleasing, satisfactory garments.</p>
  <p> 2. The chief source of wool from which woolen fabrics are made is the sheep; but it is not from this animal alone that wool is obtained. It is possible to procure fabrics containing the wool of such animals as the llama, the alpaca, the camel, and several species of goats, particularly the Angora goat and the Cashmere goat of the Himalayas. Many breeds of sheep are grown purposely for the wool they give, and many are the grades of wool derived from them. Yet, not all the wool obtained from sheep and other animals enters into the manufacture of cloth for garments; much of it is used in the manufacture of blankets, carpets, rugs, hats, stockings, and other useful articles. However, it is not the purpose here to enter into a discussion of the kinds of wool used for the different kinds of cloth and other materials; rather, it is the intention to give some facts that will aid in selecting woolen fabrics intelligently when the occasion demands.</p>
  <p> 3. The old idea that woolen materials are not so good as they used to be has long since been disproved, and the fact remains that just as good material, and even better, can now be obtained. Of course, the vast quantities of woolen material that are now manufactured have much to do with poor material creeping in; but sight must not be lost of the fact that cloth manufacturers, to meet demands, must in many cases produce fabrics that look well and that can be sold at a price to satisfy persons who want such goods.</p>
  <p> The varieties of woolen cloth or fabrics are many, as are also the weaves, and the colorings are almost beyond description; in fact, it is not too broad an assertion to say that woolen materials of every color imaginable can be procured. The designs, too, beggar description, for with the plaids, stripes, checks, and other designs that are possible in the modern manufacture of woolen fabrics there is little left to be done; indeed, the yearly task of creating something new in dress goods to satisfy the demands of fashion grows more severe from year to year, and, as in connection with styles, it is simply a matter of bringing out in a different way something that has been seen before.</p>
  <p> 4. It is well to bear in mind that all woolen fabrics are not made of new wool entirely. Indeed, there is only a small percentage that is <em>all wool</em>. In many so-called woolen materials, <em>shoddy</em>, which is fiber remanufactured of shredded rags of flannels, yarns, stockings, and other soft woolen fabrics, <em>mungo</em>, which is derived from the shreds and clippings of milled woolen cloth, and other adulterants are used to replace new wool. By blending or mixing wool in this manner it is possible to produce woolen materials that serve their purpose very well at a lower cost than would be possible otherwise, and, at the same time, by knowing how, the manufacturer is able to produce color effects and textures that are suitable for the ever-increasing desire of the buying public for something different.</p>
  <p> 5. In the manufacture of textiles, mixtures of wool and silk, wool and linen, and wool and cotton are not uncommon. Many persons contend that <em>mixed fabrics</em>, as such materials are called, wear better than all-wool materials. Whether or not this is true is debatable, so far as silk-and-wool and linen-and-wool mixtures are concerned; but in connection with cotton-and-wool mixtures there is no question of its inferiority to all-wool fabrics. Cotton-and-wool fabrics are, of course, cheaper, but it stands to reason that a material whose warp threads are of cotton and whose woof threads are of wool will not stitch so evenly nor press so well; then, too, the cotton threads are twisted harder than the woolen threads and they have a tendency to cut the threads of wool, causing them to wear away before the cotton ones do and thus giving the material a cheap, cottony appearance.</p>
  <p> It must be admitted, however, that each material has its place in the making of garments; but all-wool fabrics have marked advantages over those which are adulterated, and a knowledge of how to proceed in the selection of woolen materials should be a source of great satisfaction to the person who sews.</p>
  <h3> <a name="hints" id="hints"></a>HINTS ON THE SELECTION OF WOOLEN MATERIALS</h3>
  <p> 6. In the selection of woolen materials for garment construction, a number of points must be taken into consideration if it is desired to get fabrics that are up to the standard. There is no set procedure to follow, but the material should be examined to ascertain whether it is all wool, and the nature of the fabric, its condition, its color, and its weave and design should all be looked into carefully.</p>
  <p> 7. <strong>Test for Wool</strong>.&#8212;To know that material for a dress is all wool is not only a source of satisfaction, but a necessity in many instances, for all-wool fabrics do not wrinkle easily and they lend tone to a garment because they may, unless very heavy, be draped and hung with good results. A good way in which to determine whether material is all wool is to touch a small piece with a lighted match. Wool singes readily with a very little flame and gives off a disagreeable odor similar to that of burning hair, while cotton threads flame up and smoke, but do not burn so quickly as do those of wool.</p>
  <p> 8. <strong>Nature of Fabric</strong>.&#8212;No fabric should be accepted on its name alone. It should be examined carefully in order to make sure that it will lend itself to sponging and pressing and that the warp and woof threads harmonize in weight and blend together so that the material will retain pressing and not become rough nor full up.</p>
  <p> 9. <strong>Condition of Goods</strong>.&#8212;All woolen fabrics, or any kind of material and trimmings, for that matter, should always be examined carefully to see that they are absolutely clean and free from signs of shop wear, such as faded lines on the outside folds, spots, dust streaks, or pulled threads. Such goods, though, may often be bought at a considerable reduction in price, and where time is not to be considered the material may be cleaned, sponged, and pressed to appear almost as good as new.</p>
  <p> 10. <strong>Color of the Material</strong>.&#8212;The coloring of woolen materials, or fabrics, should not be regarded lightly. Colored woolens, to be satisfactory, should be dyed evenly, and the color itself should be good and clear in order to withstand the sponging and pressing that is necessary in the making of garments. Sharp, hard colors in woolens denote, as a rule, cheap materials, for the nature of good wool is to dye soft and even. In examining the color, it is well to separate one woof thread of the material and to hold this thread in the best light possible to get the full effect of the tones of the color. It is always best to examine any fabric, especially woolen fabrics, in the full daylight&#8212;not in half-lighted stores or under artificial light of any kind. If, in purchasing such material, the light in the store is not good, permission should be obtained to take the goods to the store door or a window so that it may be examined in daylight. Salespeople will generally grant such a favor gladly, for they know that all good woolen fabrics appear at their best in such light.</p>
  <p> 11. <strong>Design and Weave of the Material</strong>.&#8212;The design and weave of the fabric should also be carefully considered in selecting woolen materials. When examining the design or the weave, it is advisable to place the cloth between the purchaser and the light; in this position the design can be seen to the best advantage, and imperfections, if there are any, can be more readily detected.</p>
  <p> The weave of woolen fabrics affects the wearing quality, the color, the construction, and the success of the finished garment itself. A close, twilled weave makes a firm, durable material, while looser weaves often do not wear or retain their shapes so well; on the other hand, the closer weaves become shiny more quickly than do the loosely woven fabrics, although they wear better and are less likely to catch on rough surfaces or sharp projections. Imperfections in weaving are often a cause of weakness in the material; and sometimes weakness is due to too great a difference in the strength of the warp and  woof threads. Such a defect as the latter can be detected by holding the material to the light or by exerting pressure with the thumb and the fingers. Materials having cords or ribs running one way are weaker than fabrics in which the cords or ribs run in both directions, for the reason that cords or ribs, to be brought out prominently, must be combined with threads that are finer and more loosely woven. By crushing woolen material in the hands and rubbing it together, the way in which it will wear can be told with a fair degree of accuracy, for the roughness of the surface will be brought out just as it would be in wearing.</p>
  <h3> <a name="kinds" id="kinds"></a>KINDS OF WOOLEN MATERIALS AND THEIR USES</h3>
  <p> 12. In addition to knowing the points to cover in the selection of woolen fabrics, a knowledge of the various kinds of woolen materials, as well as their quality, width, and price and for what purpose each kind is best adapted, is very essential to every person who sews. With this fact in mind, there is here presented a table of woolen materials.</p>
  <p> This table, designated as Table I, can be studied to good advantage, and should ever serve as a convenient reference. Only standard materials are considered in this table, for the reason that, as in connection with domestic materials, each season brings out so many varieties of colors and textures that it is quite impossible to give anything very definite regarding them; yet, as each new fabric closely resembles some standard material, no one thoroughly familiar with all standard materials should ever be at a loss to distinguish their relationship.</p>
  <p> Many of the fabrics brought out, for want of a better name, are referred to as novelty suitings. However, such materials are greatly sinned against by some merchants, who, in order to get rid of odds and ends, place on sale as <em>novelty suitings</em> what are really remnants of irregular and rough weaves.</p>
  <p> Manufacturers and dealers often make a distinction between woolen and worsted fabrics. In the manufacture of cloth, <em>worsteds</em> are fabrics made from long staple wools and <em>woolens</em> are fabrics made from short staple wools. In the yarns of the former, all the fibers lie parallel, and in the yarns of the latter they cross or are mixed. However, in a general way, there is scarcely any reason for trying to make such a distinction here, because each kind of standard woolen fabric possesses a name by which it is distinguished from other fabrics.</p>

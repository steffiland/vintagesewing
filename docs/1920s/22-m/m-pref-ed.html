<h2>MERCHANDISE  MANUAL SERIES&#8212;MILLINERY</h2>
<h4>EDITOR OF SERIES, BEULAH ELFRETH KENNARD, M.A.<br />
<span class="small">Formerly Director of Department Store Courses, New York
University; Chairman of Committee on Merchandise Courses for New York  City
Public Schools;   Educational  Director, Department Store Education
Association</span></h4>
<h4>CONSULTING EDITOR, LEE GALLOWAY, Ph.D.<br />
<span class="small">Professor of Commerce and Industry, Head of Department of
Management, and formerly Director of Training School for Teachers of Retail
Selling, New York University; formerly Educational Director, the National
Commercial Gas Association</span></h4>
<h3>EDITOR'S PREFACE</h3>
<p>As "Department Store Merchandise Manuals" these books were originally
written for salespeople and were designed to give them reliable information
concerning the sources and manufacturing processes of the merchandise which
they handle. When it was necessary to deal with scientific or historical
material it was treated as simply and concretely as possible and the point of
view taken was that of business rather than that of the school or laboratory.
In this form they have proved their practical value not only to the
department store salesperson but in the specialty shop. It has been pointed
out, however, that the material has a wider scope than that of sales manuals
alone.</p>
<p>As reference books, librarians will find the short, clear statements and
full indexes invaluable.</p>
<p>As an encyclop&aelig;dia of merchandise the series contains scientific
information in a simple, compact form which makes it available for children
and others to whom the subjects treated are unfamiliar.</p>
<p>As textbooks they are adapted for use in commercial schools, high schools,
night schools, settlement classes, and by teachers of household arts and
domestic science.</p>
<p>As source books for practical story-telling, kindergartners, primary and
vacation school teachers will find in them an abundance of interesting
material for short "true" stories on the various industries and crafts, the
manufacture of household articles, such as pins and needles, as well as the
making of pottery, glass, and steel. These manuals contain just the material
often hunted for in vain by teachers and librarians.</p>
<p>As household helps and shopping guides the young housekeeper will find the
manuals her best friends because they not only describe the manufacturing
processes but tell her how to distinguish well-made articles of good
materials from the inferior and badly made. They also tell her how to care
for the clothing or household goods which she has bought.</p>
<p>For salespeople and storekeepers they supply the general and specific
information about their merchandise which is indispensable to efficiency, yet
very hard to gather from the scattered sources upon which they now depend.</p>
<p>These changes should enlarge the usefulness of the manuals without losing
any of their specific value in the field of salesmanship.</p>
<p>The subjects of color and design are of great importance in the treatment
of many kinds of merchandise. To avoid any confusion arising from varied
statements of principles the editor has put the material into a standardized
form approved by the authors of the manuals in which these chapters
appear.</p>
<p>We wish to express our grateful appreciation to the manufacturers and
experts who have given us such valuable counsel and cordial co-operation.</p>
<p>BEULAH ELFRETH KENNARD.</p>

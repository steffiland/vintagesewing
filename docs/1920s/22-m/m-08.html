<h2>Chapter VIII&#8212;HAT TRIMMINGS&#8212;FEATHERS</h2>
<h3><a name="variet" id="variet"></a>Varieties</h3>
<p>Every season brings change and variety in the trimming of hats. Some
fashions return after a few years; others are eliminated permanently. It is
an old proverb that a fashion returns after seven years, but like many
proverbs this is merely a suggestion of the truth and must not be taken too
literally.</p>
<p>The standard trimmings for hats are:</p>
<ul><li>Feathers</li>
<li>Flowers and fruit </li>
<li>Ribbons </li>
<li>Ornaments</li>
</ul>
<p>Other trimmings include:</p>
<ul><li>Lace</li>
<li>Maline</li>
<li>Chiffon</li>
<li>Fur</li>
<li>Leather</li>
<li>Beads</li>
<li>Yarn</li></ul>
<p>Feathers are found in many forms, including wings, quills, tails, bands,
aigrettes, pompons, pads, and plumes.</p>
<p>Flowers are arranged singly and in wreaths, sprays, and bunches, with or
without foliage.</p>
<h3><a name="influence" id="influence"></a>How Style Is Influenced</h3>
<p>Style in trimmings follows public interest in many cases. If the attention
of the country is centered for any reason on the Orient, Chinese ornaments
may come into vogue. A play or a popular actress may introduce a fashion in
hats. Some years ago colors and designs followed Persian effects, and later
Bulgarian designs, when the Balkan wars were in progress. When a pope died a
number of years ago, "eminence purple" became fashionable. The recent war
gave a military slant to all fashions.</p>
<h3><a name="story" id="story"></a>The Story of Trimmings</h3>
<p>The story of trimmings for hats is perhaps as ancient as the story of
hats, and not a great deal is known about it. A few facts are certain. For
instance, the question has often been asked why trimming tends to be placed
more often on the left side of a hat than upon the right? In olden days when
men wore velvet bonnets with plumes and carried a sword which they might be
called upon at any time to use, there was danger in having the sweeping plume
on the right side. If the knight were on horseback and had an encounter with
an adversary, his sword might catch in his own plume, unhorse him, and cause
his overthrow. Hence plumes and trimmings were worn on the left side.</p>
<p>For centuries men dressed in much brighter colors than they do at present,
and wore hats with trimmings. Their dress, as we know it, was standardized in
the early part of the nineteenth century, and all ornaments passed over to
women. Men love color. Even yet many of our leading hat designers are men,
although the number of women in the important positions in the trade is
increasing.</p>
<h3>Feathers</h3>
<p>Feathers are suitable for all seasons, as they are always attractive; and
since they are of animal fiber and designed by nature to stand all kinds of
weather, they usually wear well. The kinds in general use are those of the
ostrich, vulture, peacock, goose pigeon, duck, guinea-fowl, barnyard fowl,
owl, pheasant, and parrot.</p>
<p>Until recently, a study of feathers would have included many wild birds
from this country and elsewhere, but a United States law has prohibited the
importation of both wild and song birds and in addition many states,
influenced largely by Audubon societies and other organizations for the
conservation of wild life, have prohibited the sale of certain feathers, so
that in the future such plumes as those of the osprey and the egret will be
rarely seen.</p>
<p>Only ostrich, domestic, and game birds are left to furnish plumage for the
millinery trade. There is supposed to be, however, enough raw stock left in
the country to supply the demands of several seasons. The plumage of the bird
of paradise, gourah, numadie, heron, and egret is used principally in the
aigrette form.</p>
<h3><a name="treat" id="treat"></a>Treatment of Feathers</h3>
<p>Feathers are put through various processes before they are ready for
branching or pasting. In the final forms they are known to the trade as
plumes, pompons, aigrettes, breasts, wings, pads, bands (to encircle the
crown or to outline the brim), and quills. A table follows, showing what
kinds of feathers are made up into each of the various forms of branching or
pasting.</p>

<p class="small">Gourah; plain, the female; Imperial (with eye in plumage), the male.</p>
<p class="small">&#8224;Soft side feathers. The larger breast features of the
  goose are technically called &quot;Nagoire.&quot;</p>
<h3><a name="ostf" id="ostf"></a>Ostrich Feathers</h3>
<p>The ostrich, which is now bred for commercial purposes on large farms, was
formerly a native of the deserts of Africa and Arabia: It is a very large
bird; an adult male weighs 300 pounds and can look over a fence 9 feet high.
The female is gray, the male black with wings and tail bordered in white.</p>
<p>The ostrich has the reputation of being a very stupid bird, which thinks
to escape its enemies by hiding its head only.  The fact seems to be that the
bird, scenting danger from afar, conceals itself in a shadow, its head behind
a rock if possible. It is now said, indeed, that when the head is concealed
the bird is practically invisible, as the body blends with the color of the
sand, and so the device is really clever. At any rate, other habits, for
example its skill in concealing its nest, show no lack of cleverness.</p>
<p>A few hens and one cock make and guard one nest of eggs, feeding the one
or two dozen young birds that hatch upon the extra eggs which the hens have
scattered about the nest in the sand. The heat of the sun does most of the
hatching in the deserts, but the ostrich broods in addition, probably to
protect the eggs.</p>
<h3><a name="farms" id="farms"></a>Ostrich Farms</h3>
<p>Ostrich farms are conducted in Cape Colony, South Africa,
  and in California and the western states. Figure 6 gives a view of a large
  number of
ostriches on an ostrich farm.<span class="small"> <em>[Note&#8212;Figure 6 missing from book] </em></span>At
regular
intervals
the
birds
are
deprived
of
their plumes. The first feathers are plucked when the bird is a year old.
They increase in beauty and value until the fifth year, and are good for many
years afterward. Three hundred feathers may be taken from a single
ostrich.</p>
<p>The plucking must be done very carefully in order that new plumes may
grow. The feathers are graded and sold by weight.</p>
<p>The varieties of feathers obtained from the ostrich are as follows:</p>
<dt>Floss</dt>
<dd>Under the wing feathers, used for boas, muffs, trimmings, fancy pompons,
and head dress.</dd>
<dt>Booze</dt>
<dd>Tail feathers, used to fill in.</dd>
<dt>Byax</dt>
<dd>Wing feathers, used for tips.</dd>
<dt>Long</dt>
<dd>(First grade) wing feathers, black and pure white from the male. Three or
four raw feathers are put together to make an ostrich plume, the stems being
carefully shaved down so that they may not be too thick.</dd>
<dt>Chicks</dt>
<dd>The feathers of young birds are used for imitation aigrettes and birds of
paradise. The flue is burned away by chemicals.</dd>
<dt>Spade</dt>
<dd>Body feather before it becomes fully developed. The top is not filled
out.</dd>
<dt>Male and female feathers</dt>
<dd>Black and pure white feathers are from the male bird. Feathers from the
female are gray or mixed.</dd>
<dt>Bleached feather</dt>
<dd>Ready for dyeing.</dd>
<h3><a name="forms" id="forms"></a>Forms of Ostrich Feathers</h3>
<p>Ostrich feathers are made up principally in plumes, tips (small plume
feathers), pompons, and bands. The plumes are usually two- or three-ply, that
is, of two or three feathers. When three-ply the inner filling is composed of
shorter lengths.</p>
<p>A plume may be curled at different times to give the effect of different
sizes according to the demands of fashion. A tight curl will naturally give a
narrower appearance than a broad or full curl. The length of a plume is
frequently deceptive as the head may be curled over, to a greater or less
extent.</p>
<p>Willow plumes were very popular a few years ago. Each tiny feathery fiber
is lengthened by having several lengths of the same kind knotted to it, a
tedious, fine, hand process. The result is a plume with long, sweeping
feathers.</p>
<p>Plumes are measured from the stem where the flue begins to the tip of the
head. The width is determined by laying the plume perfectly flat and
measuring its total width at a point about in the center. Ostrich feathers
are frequently treated with acid and glycerin to give a much thinner
appearance to the flue. When so treated they are generally used in aigrette
form or branched in some novel way. This is called burnt ostrich.</p>
<h3><a name="dyeing" id="dyeing"></a>Dyeing Ostrich Feathers</h3>
<p>If the color is to be light, the dye liquor may be cold, but darker shades
require cold water first, and then slow heating until the water is very
hot&#8212;though never boiling. The quill and butt, or end, of the feather
are dyed first, and later the tip and flues, because the former parts may
take twenty or thirty minutes to absorb the color, whereas the tip and flues
will take the dye in two minutes. If the stem does not take the color
thoroughly enough, it has to be painted afterwards. After a thorough rinsing
in warm water the feathers are partly dried by soft rubbing with a cloth,
then laid on paper and covered with powdered dry starch. The starch is gently
beaten and shaken out, and the process repeated until the starch is fully
removed and the flues fluffed out. If starch paste forms on the feather it
may ruin it, or if too much dry starch remains on the flues the feather may
look woolly and have to be redampened and starched over again. </p>
<p>Wet starching,
  a process employed by professional dyers, consists in rubbing the feather in
  a milky mixture of cold starch and water (not a paste), then drying by
  running it between folds of cheese-cloth through a wringer, and placing it
  in a warm room or sunlight. When thoroughly dry the starch is beaten out gently
  on the edge of a table.</p>
<h3><a name="black" id="black"></a>Black Dye</h3>
<p>The secrets of the black dyeing of feathers are kept by good dyers; but
the process with logwood dye, which is the best, takes about six days. The
methods of dyeing, except for the black feathers, are quite simple. The
feathers are dyed in small quantities. Acid dye stuffs, either formic or
oxalic acid, are best in color and fastness. If the feathers are not bleached
before dyeing, they are washed thoroughly in castile soap and water and
rinsed. They are then soaked in hot water half an hour to get the stems and
quills soft enough to take the dye well.</p>
<p>Feathers are often painted with oil paint and gasoline, but the color rubs
off and there is danger of plastering the tiny barbules together if the paint
is too thick. Barred or stenciled effects may be obtained by painting.</p>
<p>Shaded effects are made by first dyeing the whole feather in a weak bath,
and then strengthening the color gradually as the feather is withdrawn bit by
bit. Only the end is put into the last and darkest bath of dye.</p>
<p>After steaming, the feather is curled by hand with a special knife.</p>
<h3><a name="vulture" id="vulture"></a>Vulture Wings</h3>
<p>The vulture, a large naked-headed bird of prey, is found in many
countries, including Arabia, Egypt, Africa, and America. The large wing
feathers are admirable for quills when that trimming is in vogue. The other
plumage of the vulture resembles that of the ostrich chick and is principally
used in aigrette effects after it has been treated with acid and glycerin.
The longer fiber vulture plumage is frequently used to imitate numadie.</p>
<h3><a name="peacock" id="peacock"></a>Peacock and Pheasant</h3>
<p>Peacocks are raised in Europe and are native to India, Ceylon, and Malay.
Formerly the peacock was eaten but is now used for the plumage, or as an
ornamental bird. In ancient Greece the peacock was sacred to the goddess
Juno, and later was used in Christian Byzantine art as a symbol of the
resurrection.</p>
<p>The long-tailed pheasant has been introduced into the United States from
Asia and Europe. The plumage of the male bird is very brilliant. The longer
tail-feathers of the peacock and pheasant are frequently used in their
natural state, or sometimes burnt with acid.</p>
<p>They may be used as separate feathers to encircle the crown or to outline
the brim, or may be placed at some odd angle on the hat. They are frequently
used in aigrette form after they have been burned with acid. The breast
feathers of these birds make excellent pads or breasts. The peacock in this
form is invariably used in its undyed state, whereas the pheasant is
frequently dyed.</p>
<p>The Lady Amherst pheasant is specially popular.</p>
<h3><a name="wild" id="wild"></a>Wild Duck, Parrot, and Guinea-fowl</h3>
<p>The plumage of the wild duck, parrot, parrokeet (a small parrot), and the
mottled plumage of the guinea-fowl are generally used in their natural undyed
state in the form of wings, pads, and breasts, as these feathers are
excellent for pasting. Sometimes they are used alone but not infrequently
they are combined with pigeon or fowl feathers of a solid color, thus forming
an attractive color contrast. The pointer, or long wing feathers, of these
birds are used to supplement their small feathers in making wings.</p>
<h3><a name="pigeon" id="pigeon"></a>Pigeon</h3>
<p>The pigeon is found in almost all parts of the world, and there are many
domestic breeds. The fine breast feathers of the pigeon, technically known as
"rond," are used for making the finest of pads, breasts, and pasted bands.
They, together with pigeon pointer feathers, are also used for making the
costlier wings in small and medium sizes.</p>
<h3><a name="fowl" id="fowl"></a>Fowl</h3>
<p>Wild fowl of all kinds contribute largely to the crop of feathers.
Domestic fowl, including goose, duck, turkey,, and barnyard fowl, or chicken,
are very much used in European countries and now also in America. Such fowl
are raised almost as much for their feather value as for their meat value.
This is particularly true of the pure white varieties which can be easily
dyed and treated. The feathers of such birds are burnt with acid, dyed, and
made into all sorts of aigrette effects. If not burnt they are used in making
wings, pompons, pads, breasts, and bands. Their long pointer wing feathers,
in addition to being useful for finishing made wings, are also excellent for
single quills.</p>
<h3><a name="coq" id="coq"></a>"Spanish Coq" and Hackle</h3>
<p>The saddle feathers, the long slender feathers which droop from each side
of the saddle of the barnyard cock, are commonly known as hackle feathers.
When dyed various shades they have an attractive brilliancy and are employed
principally for breasts and pads, though sometimes they are used to give
finish to wings and in pompon effects. The dark bronze green tail feathers of
the barnyard cocks of certain breeds are valuable for pompons and sweeping
aigrette effects. These are particularly durable since they are invariably
branched with wires and not pasted in the process of manufacture. Coq  is a
shaded tail of feathers. Coq is also spelled "coque."</p>
<p>Some of the birds of which importation is now forbidden are still used. A
few words about the most important of them follow.</p>
<h3><a name="egret" id="egret"></a>Egret or Aigret (a kind of Heron)</h3>
<p>Many people object to the use of the true aigrette plumes because they are
the nuptial plumes of the white egret. This small white heron formerly lived
in swamp lands, from Florida to as far north as New Jersey. It has been
practically exterminated in North America, although it still exists in South
America, whence many lawless hunters try to smuggle the sprays into the
United States. The plumes of the crest grow only when the mother bird is
tending her helpless young.</p>
<p>The "dead feathers" which naturally fall from the crest are not very
desirable, so the hunters, not satisfied with these, tear the crest from the
bird's head, thus obtaining what is technically known as "live feathers." The
hunters either kill the bird or leave her to die, while the  young in the
nest die also. One crest has about forty plumes.</p>
<p>There have been very bitter legal fights about aigrettes in almost every
state. The spray is so beautiful and delicate, as well as so strong and
graceful, that it has been hard for beauty-loving women to give them up, and
the price they bring&#8212;a single plume often costing hundreds of
dollars&#8212;tempts hunters to get them. Imitations are rapidly taking their
place.</p>
<h3><a name="paradise" id="paradise"></a>Bird of Paradise</h3>
<p>In 1521 the bird of paradise was introduced into Europe from New Guinea
and adjacent islands. It received its name because it was supposed never to
alight upon the earth, but to live in the sunlight in some miraculous manner.
The reason for this fancy was that the feet had been removed from the first
skins sent to Europe.</p>
<p>The plumage of the male is of great beauty and of an odd shape, the two
delicate long feathers extending from under the wings far beyond the tail
have a tufted feathery tip like a question mark at the end.</p>
<p>Some birds of paradise are green in color, while others are of velvety red
with plumes of purple tipped with green. Natives kill them with blunt-headed
arrows during the courting season. The skins are cured by smoking and sent to
market.</p>
<h3><a name="wild" id="wild"></a>Other Wild Birds Used for Hat Trimming</h3>
<p>The gourah is a species of pigeon, living upon the ground and known as the
crown-pigeon. It comes from the islands of New Guinea or Papua. The emu, a
large ostrich-like bird, comes from Australia. Storks, which are a kind of
heron, have been used for plumage also. The marabou stork lives in India.</p>

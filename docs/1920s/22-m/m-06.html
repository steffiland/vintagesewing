<h2>Chapter VI&#8212;FELT HATS</h2>
<h3><a name="felting" id="felting"></a>Felting Properties of Wool and Fur</h3>
<p>The basal fact upon which the whole process of making felt or articles of
felt rests is the felting property peculiar to fur and wool; some kinds
possess this felting property in a greater degree than others.</p>
<p>When wool or fur fibers are viewed under a microscope, many tiny scales
are seen upon their apparently smooth surface; in fact, some fibers seem to
be made up of scales, all pointing in one direction, like the ridges on a
pine cone. Human hair is like that; if the fingers are run along a single
hair, it will be found that they will slide down more smoothly than they will
run up, on account of the scales. When fur fibers are put into hot water the
scales expand and do not cling so tightly to the fiber. Then when the water
is drained off and the scales close down on the hair again, they catch and
interlock with scales on adjacent hairs, matting the fibers together more and
more firmly as the process is repeated. This is why woolen goods continue to
shrink unless properly handled in washing.</p>
<h3><a name="source" id="source"></a>Sources of Felt</h3>
<p>The raw material for making felt hats comes from many parts of the world,
especially from Australia, New Zealand, Russia, Siberia, and Scotland. Fur is
the material used in the better hats, but wool is more common and, in cheap
grades, adulterants of cotton are used. Wool waste, or the "noils" as the
factories call it, preferably of Australian or Merino wool, is the part of
wool used for felt. It is bought in the greasy state from woolen factories.</p>
<p>Most of the fur was originally obtained from beavers, which were formerly
  found in numbers in the northwestern part of the United States and in Canada.
  They live in colonies, building dams across small streams by night, and
  concealing the entrances to their mud houses on the bank by having the
  opening several feet under water and the passageway sloping upward.</p>
<p>Other prized fur comes from the otter, mink, Russian hare, Saxony hare,
Scotch hare, Scotch coney, and French coney (rabbit).</p>
<p>Muskrat and nutria have also been used. The muskrat or musquash, a native
of Canada, is a cousin of the beaver, but smaller. He builds houses as does
the beaver and is very prolific, The pelt is sold for furs as "River Mink" or
"Hudson Seal." The fur of the nutria, or coypu rat, is imported from South
America. It is most important to get the fur for hats at the proper season.
It is much the best in the winter when it is not being shed for warm weather,
and is called "seasoned" fur; at all other times it is known as "unseasoned."
The thickest fur is obtained from animals which live in a cold climate.</p>
<h3><a name="first" id="first"></a>First Process</h3>
<p>Receiving the skins and preparing the fur for the hat-maker is almost a
separate manufacturing process, performed by specialized factories.</p>
<p>The skins are first sorted by experts into eight or ten grades according
to kind, color, or quality. They are brushed to straighten out the fur, and
then, as there are stiff long hairs sticking up throughout the soft, downy
fur, as many as possible are removed by plucking, a process which does not
harm the fur.</p>
<h3><a name="washing" id="washing"></a>Washing the Skins</h3>
<p>The skins are then cleaned of the fatty matter, of which there is a large
amount, in beaver and nutria skins especially. This process is known as
"carroting," which is washing in a solution of mercury and nitric acid.
"Carroting" is so called from the color it imparts.</p>
<h3><a name="drying" id="drying"></a>Drying and Cutting</h3>
<p>The skins are carefully dried, brushed, and then cut into narrow strips by
a machine which at the same time shears the fur close to the skin. The pelt
strips shorn of the fleece in this way are used for by-products such as glue
and gelatin.</p>
<h3><a name="sort" id="sort"></a>Sorting and Grading</h3>
<p>The fur fleece is then sorted into grades according to quality. The
choicest part of the fleece of land animals is the back, and of water animals
the belly and cheeks; towards the outer edges of the skin the quality
deteriorates. Sometimes the fur is stored to improve with age, and sometimes
dyed after it has been carroted and graded. It may be mixed and blended also
before being sold, a common mixture being one part uncarroted to two parts
carroted. It is put into 5 and 10 pound bags and sold to the hat
manufacturer.</p>
<p>The process from here on is identical for both fur and wool, and it should
be remembered that the word "wool" may be substituted for "fur"
throughout.</p>
<h3><a name="mix" id="mix"></a>Mixing</h3>
<p>When the fleeces are received by the manufacturer, the first process is
weighing and mixing the grades to make hats of different qualities. This
process requires expert knowledge. The short and the long fur are mixed
together.</p>
<h3><a name="cleans" id="cleans"></a>Cleansing the Fur </h3>
<p>To mix the fur and to cleanse it two machines are used. The first is
called a "devil." The fur is fed through it three times, being tossed and
whirled and picked apart by revolving teeth and settling again in order to
have the process repeated. The fur still has in it hairs, bits of pelt,
coarse particles, and dust, which are next removed by a machine called a
"blower." A cylindrical apparatus, inside of which a toothed cylinder
revolves several thousand times a minute, tosses the fur upward where it is
blown to another machine, while the impurities fall down upon a screen which
sifts them. This operation is repeated several times.</p>
<h3><a name="form" id="form"></a>Forming</h3>
<p>The next process is called "forming." In preparation for it the exact
weight of fur for a hat, in the case of a soft hat from three to five or six
ounces, is put into a little box. A dozen of these boxes of fur are then put
into a case, and from this point on the hats continue to be grouped by
dozens.</p>
<p>An operator feeds the fur, box by box, through rollers, into the machine
called a "former," which roughly forms or shapes the hat body. This machine,
invented in 1846, reduced the cost of labor to about one-tenth that of the
slow hand method. A part of the machine whirls and scatters the fur. A cone
of thin copper plate, perforated with many tiny holes, is slowly revolved,
while a suction fan revolving very swiftly&#8212;about 4,000 times a
minute&#8212;below the cone draws the fur down evenly all over the cone's
surface and mats the fibers together. Wet cloths are thrown over the cone,
another perforated cone of the same shape is placed over it, and the whole is
put into a tank of hot water for a minute and then passed to the next
process.</p>
<h3><a name="feltp" id="feltp"></a>Felting Process Begun</h3>
<p>This matted fur, even as it comes from the hot water, is the beginning of
the hat body. It is about three times larger, however, than the finished
shape&#8212;some 32 inches deep and 36 inches in diameter.</p>
<p>The cone might be discarded at this point, for the process of felting has
really begun. In order to harden the fur bodies enough to prevent breakage in
later handling they are wrapped in a woolen cloth still attached to their
cones, rolled gently by hand, squeezed, and pressed.</p>
<h3><a name="sizing" id="sizing"></a>Sizing</h3>
<p>The sizing process now begins; after it has been repeated the cones are
reduced to one-third the original size. Three or four cones are dipped
together into a tank of water kept at the boiling point by steam, and then
rolled upon a sloping table, which is called a "battery."</p>
<p>The hats are taken out of the boiling water quickly, wrapped in burlap,
and again rolled gently by hand on the table to dry them. As the process is
repeated the hats may be treated less gently, since the felt continues to
knit more closely together. The rolling tends to mat the fibers closely as
they press together and spring back.</p>
<p>In cheaper grade hats this process is done by machine, but the hand method
is considered better. The reduction in size and thickness must be uniform,
and this is secured by shaking and turning the cones. By this method any
imperfections are discovered and should be corrected at this point. Foreign
particles which have escaped removal by previous cleansings must be taken
out. The selvage is trimmed, and the size in which the hat is to be finished
is marked on the edge by a notch.</p>
<h3><a name="dye" id="dye"></a>Dyeing</h3>
<p>The mixture of the different colors of the raw material results in a gray
shade in the body, and if the hats are to be dyed, they are boiled several
hours at this stage in a solution of the desired color. The dye is in large
vats and is constantly stirred to give uniform color. In the drying room the
hats are dried thoroughly at a high temperature. Coal tar products are
generally employed for dyeing.</p>
<h3><a name="stiff" id="stiff"></a>Stiffening</h3>
<p>After dyeing, the hats are soaked in a solution of shellac in alcohol to
stiffen them. A cheaper solution is of shellac and alkali, and since 80 per
cent of the alkali may be recovered for use again, it is generally used. The
hats are dipped again and again in the solution and rolled, and when
thoroughly soaked the alcohol is allowed to evaporate or the alkali is
counteracted by an acid. They are dried at a high temperature and steamed to
draw the shellac into the interior of the fabric.</p>
<h3><a name="stretch" id="stretch"></a>Stretching</h3>
<p>The stretching department receives the hats next and places them on
machines; here they begin to resemble the finished shape. The felt cone is
worked slowly and gently onto a revolving block, shaped like the crown of a
hat and called a "tip," and is forced down until it conforms to this shape.
The tip-stretching shapes the crown only; after this the brim must be
stretched. The hydraulic presses which then block the hats into shape often
exert 500 pounds' pressure. These presses use metal dies of the exact shape
of the finished hat.</p>
<h3><a name="finishp" id="finishp"></a>Finishing Processes </h3>
<p>Until this stage the process has been the same for both soft and stiff
hats, but from now on the treatment is different. The soft hats are dried
after the machine blocking, softened again by steam, shaped and stretched by
hand over a die of the desired shape, ironed by hand with a hot iron, and put
to cool in a cold water press. If the surface of the hats is too rough, all
or part of the nap is removed by a machine with a sharp knife blade. The hat
may be polished and rubbed to bring out the best effect of the dyes and to
give a gloss. Some colors have a more glossy effect than others. The
finishing includes trimming the brim. After an inspection the hats are packed
in bandboxes and put in cases ready for shipment.</p>
<h3><a name="diffg" id="diffg"></a>Different Grades of Felt</h3>
<p>The largest business in felt hats is in men's wear, as there is a staple
demand for men's felt hats. The amount of felt used in women's headgear
varies in different years. There are many different grades and finishes of
felt. Besides wool hats and fur hats there are mixtures in which the wool is
usually underneath. Hats of shoddy, a combination of the cheapest wool and
cotton, are made only when felt hats are so popular that a very low-priced
felt is demanded by a part of the trade. The finish may be thick and downy,
or like a velour with little nap. Long hairs are characteristic of the
scratch or mohair finish.</p>
<p>Recently there has been shown a felt of a beautiful lustrous finish,
sometimes called charmeuse. The distinguishing features are the slightly
loose nap, and the polished surface, of the flat nap. The velour finish is
dense and erect.</p>
<h3><a name="histf" id="histf"></a>History of Felt Hats</h3>
<p>Felt hat manufacture is a very old industry. According to one story it was
originated by St. Clement, and the festival of the trade used to be held on
his day, the twenty-third of November. Of course, until recent years all the
operations were performed by hand, but modern machinery has usurped every
process, although it is still believed that the hand process makes a somewhat
better hat.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact felt hats date back to a time even earlier than the
legend just referred to. One of the types of ancient Roman hats, called the
"petasus," worn on a journey, was much like the felt hats now used.</p>
<p>Many traditions are connected with caps and hats. Among the Romans the cap
was a symbol of liberty. Wearing a hat in medieval times also was a mark of
distinction.</p>
<p>Hatters began to flourish in Nuremberg, Germany, as early as 1369. In 1453
the French had adopted headcovering generally. In colonial days the hatters
of England complained of the competition of the American colonies, and ever
since America has been very proficient in hat-making, although soft felt hats
were not worn here until 1850.</p>
<p>Today some of the finest hats in the world are made in America. Centers of
the industry are Philadelphia and Reading, Pa.; Orange and Newark, N. J.;
Danbury, Bethel, and Norwalk, Conn., and Yonkers and Brooklyn, N. Y. At the
present time many hats are exported from the United States.</p>

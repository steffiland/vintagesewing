<h2>Chapter I&#8212;THE MILLINERY DEPARTMENT</h2>
<h3> <a name="plan" id="plan"></a>Plan of Department</h3>
<p>The construction and plan of a Millinery Department bears a close relation
to the volume of sales, and have a vital effect upon the success of the
department and of each salesperson in it. It is because certain arrangements
and equipment have been found so practical and helpful in the selling of
hats, that similarity prevails among the millinery sections of the best
department stores of the country.</p>
<h3><a name="general" id="general"></a>General Impression</h3>
<p>The general appearance of a properly planned Millinery Department produces
an impression of roominess. The extended floor space and multitude of mirrors
enable a customer to view a hat from all sides and from all distances, just
as she would view it on the head of another woman on the street. A customer
may examine many hats, make comparisons, and choose the one that suits her
fancy. Unobstructed space suggests out-of-doors, where the hat is to be worn,
and therefore is apt to make the possession of a new hat seem more desirable;
also customers can be served more easily in a large open department.</p>
<h3><a name="atmos" id="atmos"></a>Atmosphere</h3>
<p>The atmosphere of a Millinery Department should always be one of dignified
elegance and refined taste, in keeping with the character of the goods
displayed. This has a favorable effect upon the patronage and sales, A
background of quiet refinement is created by carefully chosen carpets of
harmonious design and color, and beautiful woodwork, handsome fixtures, and
proper lighting.</p>
<h3><a name="stock" id="stock"></a>Stock Tables</h3>
<p>In the Millinery Department of most large stores large tables are given
prominent positions. These tables may be round, oval, square, or oblong; the
oblong ones are perhaps more commonly used. Generally hats of the same price
are placed on a table by themselves and arranged on standards of varying
heights.</p>
<p>The untrimmed shapes are heaped upon tables that have rails around the
edges. There are so many shapes just alike that one wonders why some are not
put away in the deep drawers underneath these tables; but the heaping
together of such a number of shapes makes the price appear more reasonable to
the customer. This is desirable, because in untrimmed hats particularly it is
their cheapness that appeals. The customer knows that articles cost less by
the dozen and she is apt to reason that if she sees many similar hats, each
one must be cheaper than if the design were more exclusive. People have
learned to expect to find bargains displayed in this way. Moreover, the
quantity, with its suggestion of freshness and variety of choice, produces
the impression of an abundance of stock.</p>
<p>A desire for exclusiveness and for a hat different from anyone else's
operates, of course, against the appeal to customers; for this reason
untrimmed hats that can be diversified by trimming according to the
customer's tastes usually sell very well in bargain lots, whereas hats that
are already trimmed are not so easily sold in this way.</p>
<p>In the drawers below the tables are the reserve shapes. Tables for trimmed
hats may or may not have drawers beneath for reserve stock and hats not on
display.</p>
<p>In specialty shops the stock is generally kept in cases and deep
drawers.</p>
<h3><a name="trying" id="trying"></a>"Trying on" Tables</h3>
<p>Small tables with chairs and hand mirrors are placed before large mirrors
which face the seated customer at well-chosen points among the stock tables. 
  It is better to have the large mirrors in three sections, as the customer
can then see herself from all angles. If there are pillars in the department,
they can be made to serve as supports for the large mirrors and small tables
may also be placed back to back.    It is one of the ways of making a
customer comfortable and so disposed to purchase.</p>
<h3><a name="display" id="display"></a>Display Cases</h3>
<p>Around the sides of the room, hats on standards of various heights are
displayed in large electric-lighted cases with movable glass doors. The floor
of these cases is about table height with large mirrors at the back and with
deep drawers for reserve stock underneath. Often only one drawer, two or more
feet deep, is constructed, instead of two drawers both of which might be too
shallow. Hats that are not easily damaged are kept there in piles several
hats deep.</p>
<p>Most departments arrange the hats so that those of one price are kept
together in one case, the first case in the row containing the cheapest hats
and so on up; or if there are many hats at one price a whole group of cases
may be devoted to them. There may be a case filled with ornaments which are
too large to be adequately displayed in the counter cases. When customers are
not numerous the glass doors are kept closed to protect the contents from
dust.</p>
<h3><a name="counter" id="counter"></a>Counter Cases</h3>
<p>Counter cases with tops and shelves of glass are placed in some convenient
section near the untrimmed hats, and are used for displaying ornaments and
trimmings. Flowers, wreaths, feathers, tips, wings, ribbons, pins, and
various fancy ornaments are thus attractively shown. Table displays of
ornaments are not unusual.</p>
<h3><a name="arrangement" id="arrangement"></a>Arrangement of Stock</h3>
<p>Although the arrangement of stock on tables and in cases is usually by
price, color schemes may be beautifully worked out by featuring some popular
shade in a whole group of hats. A few stores arrange the stock almost
entirely by color, but to do this the department must be very large. While
the main arrangement is planned by the buyer or manager, details are
generally left to the salespeople who can do a great deal to make the display
effective.</p>
<p>In all departments there are certain prominently located tables, cases,
and counters which people must pass frequently on the way to other
departments. Such counters may be made extremely useful for testing out new
goods or novelties to see whether a demand can be created; they may also be
used to exhibit slow-moving merchandise which perhaps the salespeople have
neglected to bring forward because of the fact that they have become too
accustomed to it.</p>
<h3><a name="french" id="french"></a>"French Rooms"</h3>
<p>A number of small separate rooms designed to aim in the sale of the most
expensive hats are generally, found opening from the main department. They
are planned to help the sale of high-priced hats in a number of ways. They
create an atmosphere of exclusiveness and distinction. The quiet seclusion
gives the salesperson an advantage, as well as implying a special attention
to the customer.</p>
<p>Salesrooms of this nature are richly furnished and generally are decorated
in light colors, so as to afford a more delicate background for the exquisite
hats shown in them. Since it is desirable to give every advantage to
customers and salespeople in the disposal of high-priced merchandise, the
"special" rooms usually have daylight for selecting and matching colors. Such
a room is quite often distinguished by some special name, such as the
"French Room." Dark French rooms are sometimes very effective. Customers have
said that in such rooms any hat looked becoming.</p>
<h3><a name="workroom" id="workroom"></a>Stock and Workrooms</h3>
<p>It is convenient to have the stock-room and workroom of a Millinery
Department situated as near the selling floor as possible, if not directly
adjoining it. There the trimmers work at large tables by good daylight,
altering, retrimming, and making hats, while full supplies of hat braids,
ribbons, velvet, etc., are in drawers, boxes, or on shelves. There is a
special checker, who gives part or all of her time to describing in a special
record every hat that goes out of the workroom. A good workroom has much to
do with the satisfaction of customers and the success of the whole
department.</p>

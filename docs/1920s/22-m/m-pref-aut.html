<h1><a name="maincont" id="maincont"></a> 1922&#8212;Millinery<span class="small"><em><br />
</em>by Charlotte Rankin Aiken, B.A.</span></h1>
<h2>AUTHOR'S PREFACE</h2>
<p>In   gathering  the   information   for  this   manual  the author found
few publications dealing with the processes of hat-making in  foreign
countries, except the United States Government's report on "Philippine Hats."
   This is due to the zeal with which foreign producers and exporters have
guarded the secrets of their industry, and also to the lack of any systematic
investigation of the subject.    The weaving of braids in distant countries
has been carried on in the homes, and the art has been handed down from one
generation to another; therefore the facts concerning it have been difficult
to discover.    Information as to the millinery manufactories in this country
was  more  easily  obtained,  as  the  extensive  and  progressive
establishments of the trade have shown a most generous co-operation.</p>
<p>The author is greatly indebted to the original researches of Miss B.
Cannon, Educational Director Wm. Filene Sons Company, Boston. Miss Cannon
secured reports and information from United States consular officials in
foreign countries and made a compilation of data on the subject. The author
is also indebted to the kindness of the United States Government expert on
commercial fibers; to the practical suggestions of Mr. M. B. Kreeger of the
Kreeger Store, Inc., of New Orleans; to <em>The Dry Goods Economist</em>, and <em>The
Millinery Trade Review</em> for certain information; also to R. H. Comey and
Company, dyers and bleachers of straw braids, to Gage Brothers and Company,
to Mrs. E. G. McClelland of <em>Woman's Wear</em>, and to the editor of the series for
the preparation of Chapter XII. For illustrations thanks are due to the
United States Department of Agriculture, The Philippine Bureau of Education,
<em>The Millinery Trade Review, The Philippine Craftsman, The National Geographic
Magazine,</em> and Robert M. McBride and Company.</p>
<p>This volume, with the exception of <a href="m-01.html">Chapters I</a> and <a href="m-16.html">XVI</a>, applies to the
buying of hats, since the greater knowledge of the subject the purchaser
possesses, the wiser will be her selections. Obviously, if she knows
materials, straws, etc., she will buy with greater assurance. Thus the
knowledge she may have gained by observation will be greatly increased by
study. A knowledge of the colors that are becoming and of the lines which
bring out the best features of the face, is essential in buying hats.
Everyone has picked up miscellaneous information about hats, but the
scientific study of them will no doubt be an aid to many. It is a pleasure
also, to learn the romance of millinery, and to know how the peoples in the
far corners of the earth toil for the adornment of our heads.</p>
<p>It is sincerely hoped that those who take up these studies for use in the
home, the store, or the school may find this book of some service for
practical application to their needs.</p>
<p>CHARLOTTE RANKIN AIKEN.</p>

<h2>Chapter XII&#8212;PRINCIPLES OF COLOR<br />
<span class="small">This chapter, containing the essential principles of
color, was prepared by the editor and appears in several of the manuals of
this series.</span></h2>
<h3><a name="knowledge" id="knowledge"></a>Importance of a Knowledge of Color to the Salesperson</h3>
<p>Color is a matter of very great importance in connection with many
varieties of merchandise. In order to judge textiles, china and glass, art
embroidery, draperies, rugs, ready-to-wear garments, millinery, and many
other varieties of merchandise intelligently, some fundamental knowledge of
color is essential. The accepted theories of color and color combinations are
therefore given here briefly.</p>
<h3><a name="combo" id="combo"></a>Combinations of Colors</h3>
<p>There are two ways of combining colors which produce quite different
results. They are:</p>
<ul><li>The combination of colored lights.</li>
<li>The combination of colored pigments or dyes.</li></ul>
<p>When different colored lights are combined, the result is a combination of
the two colors. When colored pigments are combined, one color seems to absorb
or counteract the other. One explanation of the difference is that the
pigments are never perfectly pure, that is, they contain elements of other
colors and therefore cannot give the same result as a combination of the
similar colored lights.</p>
<p>All colors are produced by the effect of light upon the nerves of the eye,
and as the eye sees them, colors are contained within the light itself,
forming when united a white or colorless light, as in sunlight. It is only
when part of the light rays are in some way absorbed or intercepted that we
see the remaining rays as distinct colors.</p>
<h3><a name="spectrum" id="spectrum"></a>The Spectrum</h3>
<p>Nearly every one has seen the band of beautiful colors which is formed by
a beam of sunlight passing through a prism. The same effect is produced when
the sun's rays pass through the raindrops and we see the beautiful band or
rainbow of colors in the sky.</p>
<p>The theory is that as the beam of sunlight passes through the prism, it is
separated or split into the elements of which it is made up and forms a band
of colors instead of a white light. This band of colored light is called the
spectrum, and the colors, whether seen through the prism or in the rainbow,
are known as the spectrum colors. They are red, orange, yellow, green, blue,
and violet. But when we see these colors, either in the rainbow or through
the prism, there is every gradation from one color to the next so that the
change from one color to the other is almost imperceptible. For instance, the
red changes through the different degrees of red-orange to orange, and this
changes through the orange-yellows to yellow; the yellow changes through the
yellow-greens to green; the green changes through the green-blues to blue;
the blue changes through the violet-blues to red.</p>
<h3><a name="std" id="std"></a>Standard Colors</h3>
<p>The colors of the spectrum are accepted as the normal or standard colors:
red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet.</p>
<p>These normal or standard colors are represented in each case by the
greatest intensity of the color. For instance, the standard red is the most
intense red, the standard blue is the strongest blue, and so on.</p>
<p>While the spectrum has six colors which seem to be of equal importance in
the ray of light, we find that in mixing pigments or dyes they fall into two
classes called primary and secondary colors.</p>
<h3><a name="prim" id="prim"></a>Primary Colors</h3>
<p>The primary colors are so individual that they cannot be produced by any
mixture of other colors. They are red, blue, and yellow.</p>
<h3><a name="second" id="second"></a>Secondary Colors</h3>
<p>Secondary colors may be made by mixing two of the primary ones.    They
are:</p>
<ul><li>Orange, made by mixing red and yellow.</li>
<li>Green, made by mixing yellow and blue.</li>
<li>Violet, made by mixing blue and red.*</li>
</ul>
<p class="small">*There are several theories concerning the number of primary colors in light,
  but they do not alter the fact that blue, red, and yellow cannot be made in
  pigments or dyes by combining other colors; while the tints, shades, and hues
  of all other colors except blue, red, and yellow may be made by means of such
  combinations.</p>
<h3><a name="charpc" id="charpc"></a>Characteristics of Primary Colors</h3>
<p>Of the three primary colors, yellow is the most "advancing," that is,
seems to stand out from its background. It is nearest to white and possesses
the greatest power of reflecting light. It imparts brilliancy in a greater or
less degree to every compound into which it enters.</p>
<p>Red is the most positive. It represents warmth as it is brilliant and
cheerful, and it appears to advance somewhat. Red expresses vibration,
action, and warmth.</p>
<p>Blue is the most "retiring" of the primaries and represents coldness,
appearing to recede from the eyes. It imparts coldness in various degrees to
every color or hue into the composition of which it enters.</p>
<h3><a name="charsc" id="charsc"></a>Characteristics of Secondary Colors</h3>
<p>Of the secondary colors, green, composed of the primaries blue and yellow,
is cool or warm as it inclines to blue or yellow. Yet in general it is cool,
cheerful, and refreshing.</p>
<p>Orange, composed of yellow and red, is the most "advancing" of the
secondaries. It is composed of two luminous colors and is considered the
warmest and most powerful of all the colors. It should therefore be used
sparingly.</p>
<p>Violet or purple, composed of red and blue, is the darkest of the
secondary colors and is related most nearly to black. It reflects very little
light and looks still darker in a declining light. It is a retiring color
and, although red enters into its composition, it cannot be classed as a warm
color except in its redder hues. In yellow artificial light, such as
gaslight, it appears brown. Next to green, purple may be considered the most
pleasing of the secondary colors and has almost universally been considered
the royal or imperial color. It is probable, however, that the Tyrian purple,
of which we have heard so much, approached a crimson or red, rather than the
deep and subdued color known as purple today.</p>
<h3><a name="lum" id="lum"></a>Luminous and Somber Colors </h3>
<p>Colors are also described as:</p>
<ul><li>Luminous or warm: </li>
<ul><li>Yellow </li>
<li>Orange </li>
<li>Red </li>
<li>Light green</li></ul></ul>
<ul><li>Somber or cold:</li>
<ul><li>Blue</li>
<li>Violet</li>
<li>Dark green</li>
<li>Broken tones of luminous colors</li></ul></ul>
<h3><a name="broken" id="broken"></a>Broken Colors</h3>
<p>Tertiary or broken colors are not found in the spectrum, but may be made
by mixing two secondary colors. They contain all three primary colors in
unequal proportions and are named according to the predominating color:</p>
<ul><li>Russet, orange plus purple&#8212;red predominating.</li>
<li>Olive, purple plus green&#8212;blue predominating.</li> <li>Citrine,
orange plus green&#8212;yellow predominating.</li></ul>
<p>Besides the compound colors called tertiaries, there are many other hues
into which the three primary colors enter. Among these the most
characteristic are brown, maroon, and gray.</p>
<p>Brown requires black for its basis, with a mixture of citrine and olive.
It is a retiring and sedate color, but not dismal nor depressing.</p>
<p>Maroon is formed by a mixture of russet and olive, with an excess of
red.</p>
<p>Gray is always restful to the eyes. A perfectly neutral gray which forms
the perfect background for other colors, is a combination of black and white.
Besides the neutral gray, there are many others, as blue-grays, olive-grays,
and green-grays, formed by adding other colors.</p>
<p>Black and white make gray in whatever combination they are used.</p>
<h3><a name="absorp" id="absorp"></a>Absorption and Reflection of Color</h3>
<p>The color of any object is due to its power to absorb certain colored rays
in white light and to reflect others. An object which looks red reflects only
the red and has absorbed the other colored rays. A blue body reflects the
blue and absorbs all other rays.</p>
<p>White substances reflect all the rays of light; black substances absorb
them all. For this reason black is said to be the absence of all colors, as
white is the presence of all. (However, no mixture of colored pigments will
produce white. The theory is true only of light rays. Mixtures of colored
paints will produce gray.)</p>
<p>By its absorption of light rays, black lowers the tone of any color placed
next to it.    Some colors, such as yellow, it "impoverishes."</p>
<p>By its reflection of all light rays, white heightens or brightens the tone
of any color which is placed close beside it.</p>
<h3><a name="complem" id="complem"></a>Complementary Colors</h3>
<p>The color rays absorbed by any substance "complement," or complete, the
ones reflected in making white light. Therefore, they are called the
complementary colors.</p>
<p>The complementary color of:</p>
<ul><li>Blue is orange. </li>
<li>Red is green. </li>
<li>Yellow is violet.</li></ul>
<p class="clear"><strong><a name="fig7" id="fig7"></a><a href="illust/07.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,648);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/07-t.jpg" alt="Figure 7" width="168" height="185" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>In the diagram (Figure 7) the complementary colors are found by following
the various lines across the circle to the opposite outer edge.</p>
<p>These colors are sometimes supplied by the nerves of the eye itself which
are wearied by looking too long at one hue. This may be proved by a simple
experiment.</p>
<p>If a circular piece of red paper is placed on a white background and
looked at steadily for a time, and then the eyes are turned toward a white
surface, a green circle exactly corresponding in size to the red one first
seen will appear. A blue or a yellow circle will produce their complementary
colors in a similar manner.</p>
<p>This exhaustion of the nerves of the eye also causes a color to appear
duller after one has looked at it a long time. If the nerves are rested by
another color&#8212;especially the complementary one&#8212;they will become
normal again.</p>
<p>When the complementary colors are reflected from another color rather than
a white background, they change the hue of that color.</p>
<p>To eyes which are fatigued by looking at blue, red will appear like an
orange-red, yellow will be more intense, and green will appear as a
yellow-green. If red has been looked at, blue will appear as a green-blue,
yellow as a green-yellow, and green will appear blue. After green, red will
have a violet appearance, yellow will be more like orange, blue will be a
violet-blue, and orange a red-orange. These are matters of great importance
in the display of merchandise. The following rules should be remembered:</p>
<ul><li>Red near blue seems yellower.</li>
<li>Red near yellow seems bluer.</li>
<li>Red near green seems purer and brighter.</li>
<li>Red near black seems duller.</li>
<li>Red near white seems brighter.</li>
<li>Red near gray is not changed.</li></ul>
<p>Other colors are affected in similar ways.</p>
<p>These effects are produced by the natural tendency to see the
complementary of any color, which in the case of green intensifies the red
and in all the other cases changes its color by mixing their complementary
color with it.</p>
<h3><a name="properties" id="properties"></a>Properties of Color</h3>
<p>Colors may be distinguished according to their hue, their value, and their
intensity.</p>
<h3><a name="hues" id="hues"></a>Hues</h3>
<p>The word hue may be used in three ways.</p>
<p>In writings on the science of color hue signifies the property which
distinguishes one color from another.</p>
<p>In common speech it is employed to mean a particular shade or degree of
color.</p>
<p>The word is correctly used when applied to the modification of one color
by the addition of another color. Thus, red-violet and blue-violet are hues
of violet made by the excess of red or of blue. In the diagram the hues are
found between the primary and secondary colors. Still further divisions are
possible.</p>
<h3><a name="values" id="values"></a>Values</h3>
<p>The value or tone of a color is the gradation from light to dark by the
addition of white in the lighter tones and of black in the darker ones. A
tone lighter than the standard is properly called a tint, and one darker is
called a shade, but many people call both tints and shades "shades." Rose
color is a tint of red, while crimson is a shade.</p>
<p>In the diagram the concentric circles represent the tints produced by
adding varying amounts of white; the numerals above the line represent the
parts of color; those below, the parts of white.</p>
<h3><a name="colors" id="colors"></a>Color Scales</h3>
<p>The scale of any color, whether it be a pure color or a hue, consists of
all the tones from the lightest tint to the darkest shade. There are, for
instance, scales of green-blue, purple-blue, and gray-blue.</p>
<h3><a name="intens" id="intens"></a>Intensity</h3>
<p>Intensity is the strength of a color. The normal or standard colors are in
full intensity. The intensity of a color is reduced by "graying" it with its
complementary color. By the addition of orange to blue, or of green to red,
the color may be subdued to half-intensity or quarter-intensity, and so on.
If a large amount of the complementary is added, the original color will be
reduced to a dull gray.</p>
<h3><a name="colorh" id="colorh"></a>Color Harmonies</h3>
<p>Harmony in the combination of colors may be of two kinds:</p>
<ol><li> Harmony of contrast.</li>
<li> Harmony of analogy or likeness.</li></ol>
<p>Harmony of contrast is between colors which are most unlike each other. It
is perfect when the colors are complementary. Blue and orange, or red and
green, are perfectly harmonious, one of the reasons for the pleasant
sensation being that each one deepens the color of the other and makes it
purer. The true contrasting color of any color may be found by following the
cross lines in the diagram. The harmony of complementary colors is very
bright if the colors are in full intensity. Grayed or broken tones make a
quieter harmony.</p>
<p>Harmony by contrast may also be secured with the hues on each side of the
complementary color, as blue with red-orange, or yellow or red with
blue-green or blue-violet.</p>
<p>The harmony of analogy or likeness is between colors of the same or
related color scales. They may be:</p>
<ol><li>Different shades or tints of the same scale, as light red and dark
red.</li>
<li>Different hues of the same color, as blue-green and
yellow-green.</li></ol>
<p>The first is sometimes called a mono-chromatic or self-color harmony. The
tints or shades combined should have enough variety to be distinct, but
should not be so different as to lose their likeness and form a harmony of
contrast. On the diagram these harmonies are shown along each line from the
full color to white.</p>
<p>A dominant harmony may be formed by the use of a number of hues of the
same color, as yellow-green, gray-green, and blue-green, which blend because
green is dominant.</p>
<h3><a name="artificial" id="artificial"></a>Color Under Artificial Light</h3>
<p>All colors undergo more or less change under artificial light.</p>
<p>Under gas or lamplight, which is much yellower than daylight, purples and
violets often appear brown. Some of the darker hues are almost destroyed.</p>
<ul><li>Blue is darkened.</li>
<li>Brown is made warmer in hue.</li>
<li>Green is yellower.</li>
<li>Red, orange, and yellow are all brightened.</li></ul>
<p>The inverted gas mantle gives a somewhat less yellow light, and therefore
these effects are somewhat less pronounced.</p>
<p>The incandescent electric light gives a violet hue to blue, and a reddish
hue to brown. It seems to add some red as well as yellow to colors.</p>
<p>The arc light and Welsbach gas mantle have an excess of blue, which is
imparted to colors.</p>

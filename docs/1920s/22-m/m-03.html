<h3><a name="tuscan" id="tuscan"></a>Tuscan Braid</h3>
<p>Tuscan plaits and Leghorn hats are made from Tuscan straw which varies
greatly in quality and value. The Tuscan braid lends itself to fancy weaves
with much grace, and pretty "lace Tuscan" hats are frequently seen.</p>
<p>The braid is used in wide fancy borders or in a hat apparently woven in
one piece by hand. A strong twist of two straws may be made and used as a
single strand. Several lace Tuscan hats in various colors were recently
shown, resembling in pattern the Battenberg lace which was popular a number
of years ago as "fancy work."</p>
<p>The Tuscan is a strong, durable braid, naturally of a rich cream color,
tending to a tan yellow. The straw, which is very fine, is seldom split as
other straws are, but is used whole. Other straws, such as the Panama type,
which sometimes give this same effect, are split straws specially prepared.
(See <a href="m-04.html#pan">Chapter IV</a> for information on Panama hats.)</p>
<p>The upper part of the stalk is yellow at first. In addition to the
bleaching of the raw straw by the sun, several smokings with sulphur are
given to the straw, the plait, and lastly to the hat to whiten it. The lower
part of the straw which was covered by the slender leaf is not quite so
yellow, but the darker part is known as the Tuscan.</p>
<h3><a name="florence" id="florence"></a>Florence Tuscan Braid</h3>
<p>A flat, narrow, plain braid known in the United States as Florence Tuscan
is made of seven, eleven, thirteen, or even more straws. It is woven with
quick jerks of the hand, and is either sewed together by hand at the edges or
sewed by machine with the edges lapping over each other, the number of rows
or laps to the inch indicating the fineness of the braid.</p>
<p>As Tuscan plaits tend to a yellow color in spite of the bleaching, it is
very important for the weaver to choose straws of the same shade and blend
the plaits carefully. The finest work on this straw braid, accordingly, tries
the eyes severely, so that the plaiter can work at it only two or three hours
a day. These very fine plaits, of course, are uncommon. Florence Tuscan is
usually imported in plaits, and sewed into hats in this country.</p>
<h3><a name="leghorn" id="leghorn"></a>Leghorn Hats</h3>
<p>Leghorn hats, so called because they were exported from Leghorn, a port in
Tuscany, were invented about 1840. There is a standard demand for these
attractive and durable hats. They are naturally of a yellow or cream color.
The close, strong weave and the quality of the straw give the hat strength
and stiffness, yet allow it to bend slightly in a wind. This is an excellent
feature in a shade hat, the common style of the Leghorn.</p>
<p>Leghorn hats are made in the region around Florence, usually of Tuscan
straw, from braids known as "paglia," "florentina," or "nostrale." These
braids are generally of thirteen strands but sometimes of five or of seven.
Pedal Leghorn is an inferior grade. A very cheap, smooth, extremely coarse
hat is called "Mountain Leghorn."</p>
<h3><a name="plaitleg" id="plaitleg"></a>Plaiting Leghorn</h3>
<p>Women and children may be seen on the streets of the Italian villages
plaiting braid for these hats. After a few yards are made the braid is sewn
together into the hat shape or made into placques and cones which are
afterwards blocked into the shapes desired. A coarse, twisted cotton thread
is used, which is not visible in the finished hat as the edges are fitted
together so that the hat appears to be woven in one piece. In examining a
Leghorn the places where the threads run can be detected by a slight ridge in
the upper surface of the hat. The thread is pulled tight so that the edges of
the braids interlock firmly. The little humps along the edges which fit so
closely are called the "eyes" of the braid. On the under side of the Leghorn
the regularity with which new straws were inserted in the braid may also be
observed.</p>
<h3><a name="milan" id="milan"></a>Milan Braid</h3>
<p>Milan braid of good quality makes a beautiful and durable article which is
usually popular as a spring hat in dark colors and as a summer hat in creamy
white. The hat has an attractive gloss and while somewhat flexible has
considerable stiffness. Handsome hats of Milan braid are sometimes made
double with different colored brims sewn together. The hat is called Milan
after the city of Italy near which most of these braids are produced.</p>
<p>Milan or pedal braid, as it is sometimes called, is made of seven strands,
but a coarser braid of the same straw is five-end or five-strand Milan.</p>
<p>The straw used is coarse, although of excellent quality. It is called
pedal straw, and is used in many fancy plaits besides in Milan braid. One
authority says that the lower (and therefore coarser) part of the upper joint
of the straw is the pedal straw, while the upper part is the Tuscan. Its
treatment is similar to that of other straw.</p>
<p>The best Milan is hand-blocked and hand-sewed, but in the United States
much of it is sewed on lock stitch power sewing-machines because this method
is cheaper. The hats are sized when they are blocked.</p>
<h3><a name="patent" id="patent"></a>Patent Milan </h3>
<p>An imitation of a much coarser nature, called patent Milan, is grown and
plaited in China. It is freely used in cheap hats. Even the coarsest Italian
Milan is of a better grade than the finest quality made in China.</p>
<h3><a name="split" id="split"></a>Split Straw</h3>
<p>Split straw is the straw obtained by the splitting process already
described. Two split straws are laid together, the bright sides out, and
plaited in the usual way. English seven-end or "cord" is made in this way.</p>
<p>Many hats of "split Jap" braid are manufactured in Japan and many others
are made up in the United States from imported braid. Much seven-end split
braid is made in China where the straws are woven singly. In a hat of Chinese
split straw the shiny and dull sides of the straw may easily be seen if they
are closely examined.</p>
<h3><a name="lis" id="lis"></a>Lis&eacute;r&eacute;</h3>
<p>The word lis&eacute;r&eacute; is from a French word meaning binding, and this true straw
braid is often called a binding braid. It is a very shiny, stiff, narrow
braid, made generally from split straw, but sometimes from whole straw, and
imported from Switzerland, Belgium, China, and Japan. A three-end lis&eacute;r&eacute; from
Japan is used extensively.</p>
<h3><a name="ori" id="ori"></a>Oriental Braids</h3>
<p>Straw braid manufacture has developed rapidly in China in recent years,
especially in the Province of Shantung in northern China, The chief port of
trade is Tsing-tau. Wheat straw is used, but is less carefully prepared than
in Italy. Barley and rice straw also are utilized.</p>
<p>The rice of Japan yields a stronger fiber than the rice grown in the
United States, but it is not equal to wheat straw for hat-making purposes.</p>
<h3><a name="china" id="china"></a>Braid-Making in China</h3>
<p>Braid-making in China is done by the natives in their homes, under the
direction of agents of large exporting houses. It is this labor that has
discouraged the industry in other countries, for the people can live so
cheaply that they can afford to work for little. Most of the plaiting is done
in the interior of the country and must be taken overland for hundreds of
miles to the seaports, where it is tied up into pieces, sorted, and baled,
240 pieces to the bale. One woman has to work at least two years to make
enough plait for a bale, which can be bought in the United States after all
transportation charges, middlemen, etc., are paid, at prices varying from $20
to $40 a bale. This makes the average wage a few cents a day. Much braid is
sent to England for bleaching and manufacture and later reaches the United
States.    Luton is the center of the straw-bleaching industry in England.</p>
<h3><a name="chinst" id="chinst"></a>Chinese Straw</h3>
<p>Because the Chinese wheat is allowed to grow till it is fully ripe the
straw is brittle, but nevertheless it is used for braiding. Two feet of stem
between the joints in the middle of the stalk is cut into lengths. The
resulting straws are four or five inches long. These are split into from two
to seven pieces. They are moistened to make them pliable, and woven into
braid one-eighth to one-half inch wide in odd lengths of from thirty to one
hundred and twenty yards. The Chinese bleach this braid with sulphur fumes.
They are clever in all imitations and are more skilful than any other nation
in their methods of doing up braids and hats in packages.</p>
  <p class="clear"><strong><a href="illust/front.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',558,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/front-t.jpg" alt="Frontispiece" width="210" height="131" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong><a name="front" id="front"></a>The 
    frontispiece shows several varieties of Chinese straw plaits.</p>
<h3><a name="swiss" id="swiss"></a>Swiss Straw</h3>
<p>The straw for Swiss braids is imported from Italy and most of it is made
into men's hats. The best market for Swiss straw goods is France, where the
braids are manufactured into hats.</p>
<p>Swiss Milan hemp and plain hemp are today as fine as any in quality. Also
the best broad braids, known principally as silk straw, are manufactured
there.</p>
<p>The industry is old. The peasants of the Canton of Aargau who carry it on
have inherited their skill for generations. Before artificial silk and
pyroxylin were invented, all fine silk straw braids came from Switzerland.
This country finds the competition of Italy and Japan hard to meet and is
able to hold its foreign trade in this line, not so much by the production of
staple goods, as by specialties and fancy braids for women's hats.</p>
<p>Most of the best grades are made in the homes of the people, but the
hand-work is limited to real straw; artificial or imitation braids are made
in the factories.</p>
<h3><a name="hemp" id="hemp"></a>Hemp</h3>
<p>Hemp is not a true straw but like many other fibers it is classed as a
straw braid. There are several varieties of hemp, and the plant that yields
the fiber for hat-making must not be confused with the other and coarser
sorts, such as the Sisal hemp, from which only ropes and cordage are made.</p>
<p>Manila hemp, a species of banana, from the finest fiber of which the most
delicate laces, slippers, and other articles can be made, is the source of
the material for hats; it is found growing naturally in only one place, the
Philippines. Another name used in those islands for Manila hemp is "abaca."
In the trade abaca braids are usually known as "tagal braids" or "tagals."
These are the only hat braids exported in quantity from the Philippines. Most
hats made by the islanders are made in one piece.</p>
<h3><a name="hemphat" id="hemphat"></a>Hemp Hats</h3>
<p>Hemp hats have been very popular and the probability that they will remain
in favor is great, therefore it is well to consider them in detail. Some of
the reasons for their popularity are:</p>
<ol>
<li>The ease with which the fiber dyes and retains the dye.</li>
<li>The delicate colors obtained in dyeing.</li>
<li>Strength and durability.</li>
<li>Resistance to moisture.</li>
<li>Light weight.</li>
<li>Natural stiffness together with pliability.</li>
<li>Attractive gloss.</li></ol>
<h3><a name="hempw" id="hempw"></a>Hemp-Weaving Industry</h3>
<p>In the Philippines the industry of hemp-weaving existed before the
occupation by Spain in the sixteenth century. In many regions the plant grew
wild. The sides of hills of volcanic origin are well suited to its growth,
and fertile, well-drained soil, damp air, and protection from too much sun
and wind are necessary.</p>
<p class="clear"><strong><a name="fig2" id="fig2"></a><a href="illust/02.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',606,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/02-t.jpg" alt="Figure 2" width="210" height="150" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>Abaca is cut near to the roots before flowering (see Figure 2), the leaves
and stalks are split open lengthwise, and the strips obtained from them dried
in the shade for several days. The fiber is taken in strips from the petiole,
or stalk of the leaf of the plant. A large knife is used to separate pulp and
water from the strips, the strip being pulled between the knife blade and a
block of wood. It is important to remove all of the pulp, for if any remains
it darkens the fiber. The hard outer fiber is used for cordage and the inner
for hat braid. Two men can cut and scrape about twenty-five pounds of fiber
in a day.</p>
<p>The different grades of abaca are carefully sorted into five or six
classes.    Fibers of the same quality are tied together by the rapid fingers
of the weaver in a long strand with firm, small knots.    No tying machine
can make so good a knot.    If parts of the fiber are too fine, a piece may
be doubled and tied.    Tying becomes automatic so that an expert tyer can
almost tie in the dark.    The women's income from this work is often in
addition to their agricultural work, so that their prosperity is great when
compared, for example, with that of the Chinese.    Hanks or skeins of Manila
hemp are exported in this knotted form for manufacture into  various
articles.</p>
<p>Before Japan gained first place by inventing cheap machinery for braiding,
Switzerland, France, and Italy imported knotted hemp in large quantities. The
finest grades come from Italy. A great deal of fiber is sent loose from the
Philippines to Japan to be manufactured; that is, sorted, tied, and woven
into braid largely by machinery.</p>
<h3><a name="philf" id="philf"></a>Philippine Factories</h3>
<p class="clear"><strong><a name="fig3" id="fig3"></a><a href="illust/03.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,406);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/03-t.jpg" alt="Figure 3" width="140" height="218" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>Several factories have been started in the Philippines. Machines make
braids of various widths, though usually of thirteen strands with two or
three fibers to a strand. (See Figure 3.) Since there is no import duty from
the Philippines to the United States and the duty averages fifteen per cent
elsewhere, the trade between the islands and the United States tends to
increase.</p>
<p>In 1910 machinery for making braid was introduced, but most hats are still
made by hand. The Bureau of Education is promoting this industry in the
schools and in communities; and this helps the people greatly since it
enables them to spend their time to greater advantage and at the same time
earn more money.</p>
<h3><a name="milhemp" id="milhemp"></a>Milan Hemp</h3>
<p>A very popular braid is known as Milan hemp. This is simply a hemp braid
in the Milan weave of seven ends. Large quantities of both Milan hemp and
plain hemp braid are exported from Japan, Italy, and Switzerland, the latter
producing the best. The dyeing is better in the Swiss straw; the Japanese are
not able to obtain so clear a color.</p>
<h3><a name="imih" id="imih"></a>Imitation Hemp</h3>
<p>A German imitation of hemp is made of cotton tape. It is extremely cheap,
but is too heavy for a comfortable straw hat and is not very satisfactory.</p>
<h3><a name="machineb" id="machineb"></a>Machine-Made Braids</h3>
<p>In 1840 looms were adapted to straw-weaving and for the first time braid
was woven by machinery. Machine-made braids are rapidly increasing in number
and seem destined to supplant hand-woven braids almost entirely. Factories in
every country demonstrate this fact. There are a number of large concerns
operating in the United States, and the varieties of machinery and materials
used are endless. One large factory in Philadelphia employs almost every kind
of machinery used in textile branches, weaving, spinning, braiding, knitting,
embroidery, etc. It utilizes many kinds of materials, all kinds and sizes of
cotton fiber&#8212;soft, glazed, and mercerized&#8212;various kinds of wool
and mohair, silk of different grades, artificial silk, pyroxylin, tuscan
cord, hemp, ramie, art luster, etc.</p>
<p>It is difficult to classify all braids as either hand- or machine-made,
since so many straws and fibers are made up in both ways. The following is a
description of some of the more important machine-made braids. Few of the
fibers mentioned, however, are found in hand-made braids.</p>
<h3><a name="chip" id="chip"></a>Chip</h3>
<p>Chip braid is the only wood braid in general use. A large number of willow
chip hats are made in northern Italy in the Modena province. The willows used
there grow in the valley of the Po River. The Japanese have been making this
braid, the chip straw from the trees of Japan being very white. White pine
and Lombardy poplar, and also the English willow and English native poplar,
are used to make white chip hats. In Switzerland wood-chip and silk are
braided together. Chip is made in three-, five-, and seven-end braids.</p>
<p>The young tree is split into sections and planed smooth. Another special
plane of knife blades is then drawn lengthwise down the boards, scoring long,
fine, narrow cuts, but without removing any of the material. A smooth plane
takes these fine strips off, and a thin chip straw results. Sometimes the
wood is pounded and beaten in the process. For bleaching, the material is
washed in acids and in alkalies.</p>
<p>The chip hat is light in weight, smooth, inexpensive, and has a soft, dull
finish. Bending is apt to damage it, and in general it is more easily
destroyed than some other hats. In recent years hemp has largely taken the
place of the finest chip hats, so that only the cheaper grades are generally
sold now. In the eighties chip hats were very fashionable for summer wear.</p>
<h3><a name="yedda" id="yedda"></a>Yedda</h3>
<p>Yedda braid was first produced in Italy, but the Japanese have made an
imitation which, while inferior to the Italian article, is so much cheaper
that the Japanese handle the greater part of the trade. Yedda is a tall grass
grown in Italy, Japan, and the Philippines, and from its fiber a light,
delicate hat, with a coarse, loose weave is made. Most yedda braid is woven
by machinery, but some of the fancy yeddas are woven by hand.</p>
<h3><a name="ramie" id="ramie"></a>Ramie</h3>
<p>A number of braids, usually loose and coarse, are made from the fiber of
the ramie, a kind of non-stinging nettle which somewhat resembles flax. The
fiber is bleached, dyed, and woven by machinery. It is called "China grass"
because it was originally woven in China, but now it is obtained from China,
Japan, the Philippines, Egypt, the West and East Indies, and southern
countries. The best is grown near the  equator, in a hot, moist climate and
rich, damp soil, as frost kills the roots. It is manufactured chiefly in
Germany, France, England, Switzerland, and the United States.</p>
<p>Ramie fiber, which is obtained from the upright stem, is long, glossy,
silky, and very strong; it is stronger than hemp, has more stiffness than
flax, and is almost as glossy as silk. Beautiful, fine cloth has long been
made from it, especially in China, but the process of separating the fibers
from the stem is different when it is to be used for braid.</p>
<p>The fibers are removed from the stems by hand or by machinery. Either
process is costly if done properly because of the difficulty of separating
the fibers, and of getting rid of the gummy substance which holds them
together. The degumming process consists of boiling the strips of ramie in
diluted soda, then bleaching them with a powder, and washing them in diluted
acid. The best part of the carded and combed fiber, called in the factory the
"combed tops," about four feet in length, is drawn out by drawing frames into
a fine sliver or cord, put through a bath to make the fibers adhere together,
and then treated to preserve the gloss. After this the fibers are twisted or
made into braid.</p>
<p>Ramie is very durable and is not affected by water or moisture. It could
be grown in the southern part of the United States but the cost is too great
to make the industry profitable. The ordinary nettle is sometimes used as a
substitute for ramie.</p>
<h3><a name="horse" id="horse"></a>Horsehair</h3>
<p>Hair from the manes and tails of horses is made into braids in a number of
countries, but perhaps the best are manufactured in Switzerland, largely by
machinery. The best horsehair is obtained in South America. Horsehair also
comes from Siberia, China, and Australia.</p>
<p>In one form this braid is stiff, light, glossy, and resembles open
lace-work. It is used especially in dressy hats and in those made partly of
other materials. It is also woven in a plain close style somewhat resembling
hemp, but it may be easily distinguished by the sharp little ends of hair
which are felt when the hand is passed over the hat</p>
<h3><a name="pyro" id="pyro"></a>Pyroxylin</h3>
<p>The popularity of horsehair braid led to its imitation in an artificial
silk product, known as pyroxylin (see manuals for the "Silk Department" and
the "Notion Department").</p>
<p>Pyroxylin has been manufactured successfully for only a few years and
experiments are still being made for improving the fiber. When the process
first began to be used the fiber melted if it became wet; even now it breaks
easily when damp.</p>
<p>It is easy to tell the difference between this fiber and horsehair, for
the imitation is not quite so stiff, nor so perfectly rounded as hair, which
perhaps causes the slight difference in the gloss. Both are light and
flexible, but pyroxylin is not so elastic when bent and released as the
horsehair is. Another way of testing is to burn a small quantity of each
braid. Burning hair has a characteristic odor, which pyroxylin does not
have.</p>
<p>The artificial fiber can be made up into various forms, from an imitation
of light horsehair braid to a heavy straw. Every large manufacturing country
is paying some attention to this product.</p>
<h3><a name="chry" id="chry"></a>Chrysanthemum Braid</h3>
<p>One of the many novelty braids made of artificial silk is chrysanthemum
braid. Strong cotton thread stitching holds in place the stiff, glossy silk
fibers which somewhat resemble tiny chrysanthemum petals. It is soft, light,
and attractive, but not especially durable.</p>

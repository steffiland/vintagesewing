<h2>Chapter X&#8212;HAT TRIMMINGS&#8212;RIBBONS, BANDS, AND ORNAMENTS</h2>
<h3><a name="silk" id="silk"></a>Silk Ribbons</h3>
<p>Ribbons are usually made of silk, and so a few words about that material
and the comparison of weaves follow. (For a more exhaustive treatment of the
subject, see the chapter on "Ribbons" in the manual for the "Silk
Department.")</p>
<p>Silk is the strongest, most beautiful, elastic, and durable of all the
important textile fibers used for the manufacture of cloth. The story of the
cultivation of the silk-worm is familiar to all of us. It is fed on mulberry
leaves for about five weeks, then it spins a cocoon from which a gauzy thread
averaging 2,000 feet in length can be unwound. The moth must not be allowed
to escape and so he is killed by heat before the time has arrived at which he
is due to emerge from the cocoon. Hot water softens the gum with which the
silk-worm cemented the cocoon, in a "de-gumming" process employed by the
manufacturer. Then the silk can easily be unwound. The outer fuzzy silk and the
weak fiber from the very center of the cocoon are inferior in quality and are
used
in the cheaper grades of silk. Sometimes the cocoons are pierced by escaping
moths and these too make inferior silk. Under the chapter on silk in body
hats was discussed the question of the loading or weighting of silk, and the
resulting damage to the wearing qualities of the silk.</p>
<h3><a name="weave" id="weave"></a>Weaves</h3>
<p>The simple or tabby weave found in silks such as taffeta is the simplest
of all weaves, and it wears very well.    Two-tone ribbons are made in this
way, but the lengthwise, or warp, threads are a different color from the
crosswise ones.</p>
<p>Satin ribbon, if of a cheap grade, is likely to catch and roughen, for a
large number of the crosswise or filling threads are on the surface of the
cloth to give greater luster.</p>
<p>Ribbons with a ribbed effect in the weave, such as faille or grosgrain,
usually have cotton or wool yarn in the concealed bars which go into the
filling of the ribbon. They wear well, except in the cheaper grades, in which
they tend to wear out along the bars as the silk warp threads are not thick
and strong enough to stand the rubbing along the heavy filling.</p>
<p>Plaids and stripes are made by using different colored threads for the
variations of the pattern.</p>
<p>Velvet ribbons, woven with an extra warp, which is sheared to make the
pile, are of varying grades. The backs are usually of cotton, but in the
finest grades of velvet ribbon, the backs are of silk with a satin finish.
This ribbon makes beautiful bows.</p>
<p>Velvet brocade ribbon is unusual, but exceptionally handsome. Silk
brocades of the Jacquard or pattern weave are much used many seasons. These
are made on the complicated Jacquard loom which weaves intricate patterns.</p>
<h3><a name="patterns" id="patterns"></a>Ribbon Patterns</h3>
<p>The changing demands of fashion govern the uses of ribbon, deciding not
only the quantity required for trimming but also the weaves that shall be
used. Some years Jacquard patterns, where a figure or design is woven into
the ribbon, have been in favor. Popular ribbons now are grosgrain, faille,
taffeta, moir&eacute;, cire, satin, velvet, metallic, and novelties, many of which
are made up of a combination of two or more of these weaves.</p>
<p>Cire or "stovepipe" ribbons are not distinguished by the weave, but by the
finish, the polished appearance being due to an ironing process in the
manufacture. Usually satin ribbons are cired, and soft faille also takes the
finish quite well. Polished, metallic ribbons are stiffer than cired ribbons,
but give the same effect.</p>
<p>Moir&eacute; has a watered effect produced by pressing taffeta, faille, or
grosgrain ribbons between stamped rollers. Taffeta ribbon is not apt to wear
so well as the others unless it is of good quality with little weighting.</p>
<h3><a name="widths" id="widths"></a>Widths of Ribbons</h3>
<p>Widths in millinery ribbon vary from number one baby ribbon to sash ribbon
fourteen inches wide. Different types of ribbon are used for different styles
of hats, and the style of the season also determines the width of ribbon to
be used.</p>
<p>Narrow widths are used principally in bands, cockades, bow-knots,
plaitings, and shirrings. These are used mainly for children's and misses'
hats, though narrow bow-knots are frequently employed as a finish to
elaborate flower or feather trimmed hats. Not infrequently narrow ribbons of
velvet or other material are shirred flat around the brim of a large dress
hat.</p>
<p>Wide ribbons are often used in scarf effect around the crown and also
partly on the brim of sport hats Wide ribbons are used in bow effect on
afternoon and evening hats in combination with flowers or other soft
trimmings.    The bows may be in high loops or broad and flat, as the lines
of the hat and the styles of the season suggest. Frequently broad ribbons,
especially of satin or velvet are drawn softly around the crown of a picture
hat, and then through the brim, forming back streamers, or being finished in
a loop.</p>
<p>Ribbons are either finished smooth at the edge, or with a heavy cord, or
with a picot edge. Cords often serve as bands.</p>
<h3><a name="bands" id="bands"></a>Bands</h3>
<p>Originally bands were used solely in making toques and turbans over a
foundation of maline or chiffon. More recently, however, bands have been used
around the crowns of sailor hats and others of various shapes. This is
especially true of the narrow conventional bands, or of bands made of worsted
in bright oriental combinations of color.</p>
<p>Bands are made of various materials. On foundations of net or some other
delicate material, appliques are made of sequins, chenille, straw, or
embroidery silk, either in straight rows or in a design. Sometimes two or
more of these materials are combined in a band. Bands are also made of
metallic material either embroidered or composed of solid pieces of metal
joined together. Some bands are made of white, jet, steel, or iridescent
beads strung together or embroidered in a design  on the usual foundations.
Half bands are similar in construction, but are usually of less conventional
design and are used as appliqued motifs.   Flowers are appliqued on bands.</p>
<h3><a name="orna" id="orna"></a>Ornaments</h3>
<p>Trimmings known as ornaments comprise buckles, slides, cabochons, pins,
and motifs of jet, steel, rhine-stones, mother-of-pearl, beads, soutache
braid, tapestry, gilt, silver, oxidized metal, copper, ivory, and crystal.
Many of these ornaments, particularly those made of sequins or scale jet or
jet beads, imitate wings, leaves, roses, and other objects. They are
appliqued on net, maline, or velvet.</p>
<p>Among the most novel ornaments may be mentioned emblems and objects
typical of certain countries or historical facts and periods. Even human
figures are reproduced in tapestry and wool or silk embroidery to be
appliqued on sport hats. Some of the more delicate ornaments are used as a
finish at the base of the feather on feather trimmed hats. Ornaments when
used with ribbons are popular on tailored hats. Quills of celophane are used.
Copper is often seen on bows.</p>
<h3><a name="embroidery" id="embroidery"></a>Embroidery and Painting</h3>
<p>Recently hand-embroidery, painting, and stenciling have been used more or
less in trimming hats. The embroidery material is silk floss, wool, yarn, or
metallic threads. Polka dots, cross-stitching, and other designs have been
used. The painting has been in thin color, of bird and flower designs,
showing a strong oriental influence. Bamboo straw takes paint well. Usually
when conventional or formal designs are used, the hat will remain attractive
longer and one will not tire of it so quickly. The naturalistic designs
reproducing pictures or scenes are less artistic. Silver or tinsel ribbonzene
decorates effectively.</p>
<h3><a name="other" id="other"></a>Other Trimmings</h3>
<p>Lace, when employed in millinery, is generally used either as the
foundation for a whole hat or as the sole trimming. Valenciennes lace is used
in the form of rosettes; Mechlin, Chantilly, filet, and other thin laces as
draperies; shadow, oriental, and other similar laces as the designs require.
Soft gauzy silk maline is satisfactory both for a hat foundation, a trimming
or a drapery, as well as for a veiling over other trimmings. Maline trimming
looks well in the form of bows, choux, plaitings, and other effects. It is
admirable for veiling and softening a strong color. Metallic cloth is used
both as a foundation and as a trimming, principally in bows, hand-made
flowers, little standing novelties, or appliqued motifs. Fringe and tassels
are sometimes popular.</p>
<h3><a name="fur" id="fur"></a>Fur Trimmings
</h3>
<p>Fur of all kinds is used in strips in trimming; less frequently in tufts
and other forms.</p>

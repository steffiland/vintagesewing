<h2>Chapter XIII&#8212;COLOR IN MILLINERY</h2>
<h3><a name="name" id="name"></a>Commercial Names of Colors</h3>
<p>In the field of color it is hard not to be overinfluenced by the merely
fashionable. There are usually several stylish shades from which one may
choose, and if none of these are becoming, it is far better to get something
that is becoming, even if it is not the "very latest."</p>
<p>Every year the Color Association brings out new color cards, naming these
colors just as they choose. It is not essential to learn all of these names,
but it is helpful to know the leading ones of the year in case customers ask
for them, and also because women are, always interested in the new names.</p>
<p>The name generally suggests something familiar; for instance, battleship
gray, grass green, or peacock blue. Some names last for many years and some
are not well known even for one season. The names do not change the colors
and it is more important in studying color to be able to see, for instance,
that a Nile green is a green with a  little blue in it than merely to know it
by the name of Nile green. One person may look at a hat and say that it is
violet, while another may note that the violet is not pure but has a reddish
tone.</p>
<p>No colors in materials or dyes are really pure; there is always a slight
admixture of some other color. In red found in fabrics, for instance, there
is always a little blue and yellow. The only really pure colors are found in
the rainbow and the prismatic spectrum. The mixtures of color and the
resulting tints and shades are much more varied and pleasing for general use
and much more becoming than the pure, strong colors would be. Altogether, the
rainbow hues and the shades and tints that can be made of these number about
3,000 to 4,000 known colors and color tones.</p>
<p>It is small wonder that new tones can come out every year and the supply
still remain unexhausted. Since there are so many possible color
combinations, it is impossible to know all the fancy names. But it is
possible and most useful to be able to tell the composition of each color
tone; that is, what its basic color is, and just how large an amount of black
or white there is in it. This ability, though it is often unconscious, is
essential if one is to become a good judge of color.</p>
<p>The head of a very successful dressmaking establishment once said: "I
don't care what a color is called. I want to be able to see what it is; to
analyze it." She found this power of analysis important as a first step in
deciding what would go well with a certain color. There are a number of laws
that are helpful in determining this.</p>
<h3><a name="train" id="train"></a>Training the Sense of Color</h3>
<p>Does everyone have a changeless instinct for color from the beginning? A
baby reaches for colored balls, especially for the gayest and brightest.
Primitive peoples and peasants show their love of bright, vivid colors in
their adornments and dress. Very young people instinctively like gayer,
unsoftened colors better than older people do.</p>
<p>This, therefore, is a reason for not allowing one's color sense to stay at
a standstill, because with cultivation the taste for color becomes more
refined. An uneducated taste prefers combinations of bright colors, but as
the eye becomes trained it sees more color in tones it formerly thought dull.
Think of a young boy's choice of neckties when he has his own way!</p>
<p>Yet bright colors are not to be condemned by any means. Sometimes a small
violet or scarlet hat is just the touch needed to complete a certain costume.
However, it takes a trained eye to know just when and how bright colors may
be worn, for they are far more difficult to choose and arrange than more
quiet tones.</p>
<h3><a name="solved" id="solved"></a>Questions of Taste Solved by a Knowledge of Color Harmony</h3>
<p>Color harmonies are not, however, matters of individual taste, but based
on scientific laws which may be learned by everyone. The saleswoman in the
Millinery Department can learn to make the right combinations when she knows
these laws and has trained her taste. Every day questions arise which can be
solved by a knowledge of the laws of color. For instance, what color would
you choose to make a sallow complexion look  a little pinker? What colors
will bring out the gold and yellow in blond hair? In choosing becoming shades
the hair, eyes, and complexion all have to be considered, as all are affected
by the choice of a color.</p>
<p>It is remarkable how the right color in some cases will make even the
eyebrows appear to great advantage. In a color class two shades of brown were
tried on an auburn-haired girl with beautifully penciled eyebrows. One of
them called no attention to her eyebrows, while the other showed their
beauty. Both shades were equally becoming in other respects.</p>
<h3><a name="best" id="best"></a>Bringing Out the Best Features in a Face</h3>
<p>In some faces you wish to call attention to a good feature, or to hide a
bad one. The right color will either bring out or subdue lines. Suppose tan
and putty tones happen to be in vogue. How many people there are who should
never put on such colors, since their faces have not enough natural color to
counteract the yellow and gray effect.</p>
<p>Good flesh tints cannot be brought out by colors which, working according
to the law of complements, make the complexion look blue or green. </p>
<h3><a name="reflect" id="reflect"></a>Reflection  </h3>
<p>In one way only is there an offset or exception to the effects of
    complements, and that is when there is a chance for reflection. Only when
  the materials near the face are glossy enough to reflect their color upon it,
    will this action counteract the law of complements and produce the effect
  of
    the same color that is worn.</p>
<p>With a little practice you can see cases of reflection and even produce
the effect yourself when it is needed. Perhaps the under brim of a hat, where
reflection frequently works, is the best illustration in millinery. If the
under brim is silky or glossy enough to reflect its color upon the face of
the wearer, this effect will be obtained rather than the effect of the
opposite or complementary color.</p>
<Kp>
<p>Reflection  often makes  gray or nondescript eyes  look dark blue.</p>
<h3><a name="char" id="char"></a>Characteristics of Colors</h3>
<p>As you think more about colors they seem to develop distinct
characteristics and each color gains a vivid meaning.</p>
<h3><a name="red" id="red"></a>Red</h3>
<p>Red is a stimulant which livens its surroundings. It attracts attention,
is cheerful and agreeable. Used in small quantities it is one of the
prettiest of costume decorations. It is the color of fire and warmth and
seems more suitable for winter than summer wear. The darker tones of red are
apt to be becoming to both blondes and brunettes, especially to those with a
clear complexion. Bright red, however, will bring out any greenish hue in the
skin. It is not at all becoming to those with auburn hair. A red-haired
person cannot wear pink unless it is softened or veiled in some way. The
broken hues of red, such as russet or maroon, are safer.</p>
<p>The trouble with a stimulant is that one is apt to grow tired of it in
large quantities. This is especially true of red. One is likely to grow tired
of a red dress or hat long before it is worn out, and if a person is to have
only one hat it is not wise to choose a red one.</p>
<p>To some people red is so intense and exciting as to be disagreeable.   
Pure red  should not be combined with yellow or orange, but rather with blue,
blue-green, and green.    All these combinations are better if one, or both,
of the colors are half-intensity or softened with neutrals.</p>
<p>Red is easy to match in artificial light as it changes very little.</p>
<h3><a name="orange" id="orange"></a>Orange</h3>
<p>Orange is a gay color, warm and bright, stimulating and exciting. It must
be used very carefully, as a little of it goes a long way. Can you think of
many people to whom it is becoming? It is usually very trying to wear,
because it is so intense and gives the skin a bluish tinge.</p>
<p>Broken tones of orange are more becoming to brunettes and auburn-haired
people. A blonde has a good deal of yellow, cream, and tan already in her
coloring and the intense brightness of the orange makes them look dull and
faded. Besides, the stronger tones of orange clash with the shades of her
hair.</p>
<p>Orange combines poorly with red and only fairly with red, violet, and
green, but well with blue, blue-green, and blue-violet.</p>
<h3><a name="yellow" id="yellow"></a>Yellow</h3>
<p>Yellow, like the sunlight,  brightens everything it touches. </p>
<p>Broken tones
  of yellow make tans and browns also, of a less warm tinge; these hues are
  easier to wear than pure yellow, which is trying to the complexion. The cream
  tint of yellow is very becoming, and most people look better in a
  cream-colored hat than in a pure white one.</p>
<p>Yellow is apt to be more becoming to brunettes than to blondes, unless it
is greatly softened. It combines well with violet, purple, dark red, and
blue, but is not so pleasing with orange, scarlet, blue-green, or green.</p>
<h3><a name="green" id="green"></a>Green</h3>
<p>Green is cool, refreshing, and restful, reminding us of the grass and
trees, and perhaps because nature shows us that it is a wise choice, we use
it in hats and clothing. The deeper, richer tones are usually expensive in
imitation foliage and in straw, as the dyes are costlier.</p>
<p>Shades of blue-green are said to be the most flattering of all colors.
Blue-green brings out the complementary color of soft pink in the cheeks of
the wearer. It seems to eliminate the yellow and to clear up the complexion,
and thus makes the skin look whiter. It is particularly becoming to those
with pale skins, and so it is worn a great deal in the southern part of the
country, where the warmth, too, makes a cool color pleasing.</p>
<p>The only persons who should not wear this color are those with very bright
red cheeks, or florid complexions. No wonder we find so many hats in this
color, or trimmed with it, perhaps correcting another color that is more
difficult to wear.</p>
<p>Green is difficult to match and changes somewhat in artificial light.
Other colors go well with certain shades of green, especially with a soft
grayish blue-green, but pure green is somewhat hard to combine well,
particularly with other tones of green. It is good with violet and just the
right shades of blue and green are beautiful together, but often the wrong
hues are chosen.</p>
<h3><a name="blue" id="blue"></a>Blue</h3>
<p>When one thinks of blue one thinks of the distant hills, the lakes, the
ocean, the sky. Even the air seems cooler.</p>
<p>Blue is perhaps the most popular of all colors for wearing apparel, as it
seems to bring out the character and delicacy of a face.</p>
<p>Blue is becoming to blondes, because its complementary, orange, combines
with their rose or cream-white coloring to make a delicate flesh tint. Pale
brunettes should not wear light blue, because it gives a tint of orange
yellow to their darker complexions.</p>
<p>Blue is a restful color to choose and one does not grow tired of it. In
the brighter and lighter tones and in the cheaper grades, blue straw,
ribbons, and other materials are apt to fade.</p>
<p>Blue is one of the hardest colors to match under artificial light and the
results cannot be trusted, as blue looks duller in any light which has in it
an excess of yellow. Blue in its darker tones combines well with scarlet or
red, and light blue with yellow or orange, but not with violet.</p>
<h3><a name="violet" id="violet"></a>Violet</h3>
<p>Violet is a cool, summery color, yet not too cold, especially if it is a
red-violet. It is becoming to people with fair, rosy complexions. The
blue-violet shades are more becoming to auburn hair than the red-violet ones.
The latter combination is daring and too often misses being just right.
Violet combines well with orange, yellow, and blue-green, but poorly with
scarlet or red, and is not so good with orange as with yellow. The becoming
effect of violet usually depends upon the amount of pink in the complexion.
It brings out the yellow tinge in a pale or sallow skin.</p>
<p>We used to associate violet with old ladies, and it was the only color
that elderly people were supposed to wear with dignity. While it is a very
dignified color, the symbol of royalty, our ideas have changed in recent
years and we are pleased not only to see children in lavender, but also to
see elderly people in blues and even brighter colors when they are
becoming.</p>
<h3><a name="variety" id="variety"></a>Variety in Color</h3>
<p>An old saying, "Variety is the spice of life," is nowhere more true than
in the world of color. How tired we should become of always seeing equal
proportions of colors used together. Rarely is a hat made and trimmed with
equal amounts of two or more colors, and if it is, these are so arranged as
to produce a varied effect. The rule that varying amounts of color are
attractive generally holds good.</p>
<p>Variety  is  pleasing  not  only  in  the  amount  of color but also in
its degree of darkness.    If two colors do not look well together, by taking
a tint of one and a shade of the other, and perhaps softening one or both
with gray, white, or black, the two will make an attractive harmony.    A
light green may go beautifully with a dark blue, or a pink with a violet,
whereas the full  green  or red  might not have  looked  so  well. Many
illustrations of this law of variety may be found in hats, especially in
their trimmings.</p>
<p>The most economical way to dress is to find the one or two colors that are
the most becoming and to stick to those in choosing wearing apparel. Then
everything matches. Many people choose dark blue, which is generally
becoming. If you have a customer who needs to be economical you can help her
in this way, and try to influence her against getting something that will not
do to wear with her other clothes.</p>
<h3><a name="neutral" id="neutral"></a>Restfulness of Neutral Colors</h3>
<p>A neutral color, like a neutral person or nation, is one which favors
nobody and supposedly gets along well with all.    Black, white, and gray are
the most important neutral colors.    Strictly speaking, white is not a color
at all but just light, and black is the absence of light.    Any colors can
be combined with them and for this reason they are very widely used in
millinery.</p>
<p> Neutral colors are restful and quieting to the eye. They do not
  stimulate the optic nerves unduly except in dazzling whites or in extreme
  combinations of black and white, which always make a striking effect.    In
  choosing a hat to show to a customer who wears a bright colored suit,  it is
  well to select a softening neutral.    The hat may have a touch of bright
  color to match the suit.</p>
<p>As a rule neutral colors do not attract attention and that is why most
stores require their employees to wear them. It is also the reason why, in
arranging hats for display, good decorators make neutral backgrounds in order
to bring out the colors of all the hats to greater advantage, and yet avoid
inharmonious effects.</p>
<p>If two colors do not go especially well together, a touch of black with
them or their entire separation by the use of black or white will soften and
harmonize the combination, and perhaps make each more effective.</p>
<p>Other neutrals which are much used in hats are colors with a good deal of
black or gray in them, such as brown, green-gray, and tan. Yellow is a color
that goes well with almost every other, especially when softened to a cream,
because yellow is near white in lightness and, like gold or the sunlight,
tones in with everything. Many straws are either tan or yellow, and the
natural straw harmonizes well with any color of trimming.</p>
<p>Neutrals in dress and hats are at least safe, although if untouched by
brightening colors they are apt to appear somewhat sober. A certain
distinction may often be seen, however, in hats of black, gray, or white
where the absence of color only emphasizes the beauty of the graceful and
unusual lines.</p>
<h3><a name="combo" id="combo"></a>Combinations of Neutrals with Brighter Colors</h3>
<p>Study the effect of neutrals in combination with other colors. It may take
weeks to train the eye to be really observant of color. Like any other
faculty, it can be developed greatly by training. When you have leisure as on
a rainy day, study the hats in your department. Note what neutrals are lightened
  by bits of color or what colors would be improved by the use of a neutral in
  combination. Skilful designers place a
neutral color, often white or cream, about the neck of a dress or under the
brim of a hat, in order to make them more becoming.</p>
<h3><a name="taste" id="taste"></a>How to Train One's Self in Color-Taste</h3>
<p>One of the most successful ways of training one's self in color-taste is
to try hats upon one's friends. It is remarkable to note the actual changes
in the appearance of hair, eyes, and complexions with different colors. There
is a useful old saying, "Match your eyes for the house and your hair for the
street," but it cannot be applied indiscriminately.</p>
<p>Each of your friends represents a type of the customers who will come to
you, and with this practice you may learn the colors to suggest to them. And
since you are often required to plan the trimming of hats, note everywhere
about you the effects of combinations of color.</p>
<p>In the rack of hosiery or of ties in the store, have the articles been
hung in the way that you would hang them? Would the change of one or two
improve the effect of the whole? The pretty effect of a display is often
ruined by just one clashing color. What colors seem to you to clash? Do not
believe what you are told by others in this respect but test the matter for
yourself.</p>
<p>By persistent study you will surely increase and develop your good taste.
The reward of paying greater attention to color combinations is immeasurable.
So many people wear unbecoming colors because they know nothing of color
effects.</p>
<p>Some day, perhaps, every woman will find it easy to obtain this
information to aid her in dressing; until then the intelligent saleswoman
should be able to impart it to her customer. The customer may, of course, ask
for and prefer unbecoming colors, but this happens very rarely. She is
usually more than grateful if her time is not wasted in trying on hats which
are not suited to her coloring.</p>

<h2>Chapter XIV&#8212;FORM OR SHAPE IN MILLINERY</h2>
<h3><a name="choose" id="choose"></a>Choosing a Hat</h3>
<p>"I think I'll get a tricorn," said a friend of mine, and a tricorn she
bought forthwith. In this way many people decide the shape of the hats they
wear. "I want a large-brimmed hat or a poke," one thinks and tries to find
the prettiest hat of the type previously decided upon. This method does not
always result in securing the most becoming hat, unless from previous
experience the customer first considers what shape is best suited to her
face. In addition to the question of color, there is the equally important
problem of the lines of the hat. It is necessary to fit the hat to the head
to determine its becomingness.</p>
<h3><a name="lines" id="lines"></a>Importance of the Lines of a Hat</h3>
<p>The power of the line is almost inconceivable. Faces seem to grow shorter
or longer, fuller or thinner, noses appear to raise or to lower their tips,
and even eyes seem to grow slanting or straight, large or small, under the
influence of the shape of the hat.</p>
<p>One artist says of hats: "The funny punch in the brim may bring out all
the gayety of a face; the long, soft droop may accentuate its pathos; the
jaunty upfling on the side may give it a sudden brave note," whereas: "the
wrong line may accentuate in a face, not its bravery but its coarseness, not
its prettiness but its pettiness, not its pathos but its heaviness."</p>
<p>The science of this witchery of line is elusive and only generalities can
be stated concerning it, but the same persistent, alert observation and
effort by which your eye for color is cultivated will develop sensitiveness
to the magical influence of a line.</p>
<p>The shape of the hat may be analyzed under several headings:</p>
<ol><li>The relation of the parts to each other.</li>
<li>The  kinds  of  lines,  curves,  and angles,  and their relation to each
other.</li>
<li>The relation which the form of the hat bears to the different proportions
of the  faces and heads of different individuals.</li></ol>
<h3><a name="parts" id="parts"></a>Relation Between the Parts of a Hat</h3>
<p>The relation of the parts of the hat to one another has to do with the
amount of trimming and the size of the brim in proportion to the crown.</p>
<p>There should be the right proportion between the width of the brim and the
height of the crown. A poorly proportioned hat may look top-heavy or too much
like a pancake. However, rightly arranged and massed, trimming may correct
this fault in a hat.</p>
<p>Another way in which a hat may offend the eye is by the appearance of too
much weight at the back, front, or side. A hat should look as though it would
stay upon the head of the wearer without great effort upon her part. If an
unusually large amount of trimming is upon one side of the hat body or brim
or at the back or front, it should be there only to bring out or to correct
something in the face. For instance, a head that is too narrow from back to
front, may wear a hat with an extra mass in the back.</p>
<h3><a name="curves" id="curves"></a>Lines, Curves, and Angles, and Their Relations</h3>
<p>Lines are either straight, broken, or curved. In a hat, perfection of
curve makes a beautiful shape. The curved lines should seem to flow into one
another, or to grow out of one another; they should not come to abrupt stops,
but go on invisibly in our imagination.</p>
<p>A peculiar characteristic of a line is that when the eye once rests upon
it, it tends to follow the direction of the line; this is why the most
skilfully designed curves seem to grow out of each other. For instance,
trimming often softens into a delicate little curve the otherwise sharp angle
at the base of the crown where it joins the brim. If the hat is made up of
curved lines, the trimming should follow these in order to be artistic.</p>
<p>If the hat has been fashioned stiffly in a more tailored style with broken
lines and angles, the decorations are correspondingly stiffer, more angular,
and tailored. This principle should guide one in choosing trimming Have you
not noticed as a general thing that soft, floppy hats have more curving,
flowing, graceful trimmings than tailored hats, which favor straighten
feathers, stick-ups, stiff bows, and other angular trimmings? Trimming which
sticks right out from some spot on a hat is apt to be inartistic, awkward,
and difficult to wear. Lines which curve and grow out of one another are said
to have rhythm, like a flowing melody in a song. Sharp angles and lines
suddenly breaking away from the direction in which the eye expects them to go
are harder to handle. Certain seasons bring into favor more artistic shapes
and methods of trimming! than do others.</p>
<h3><a name="symm" id="symm"></a>Symmetry in a Hat</h3>
<p>If a hat is exactly the same on one side as the other, that is, if one
side, trimming and all, supposing it folded over were to coincide with the
other, the hat is said to be symmetrical. Such a hat is more difficult to
wear than one which has different but well-balanced sides, and if slightly
askew is apt to call attention to the fact that it is not on straight. A
symmetrical hat never should be worn by a person with irregular features. A
very pretty girl whose nose is slightly to one side cannot wear a symmetrical
hat nor have her hair parted in the middle without calling attention to the
irregular feature.</p>
<h3><a name="bal" id="bal"></a>Balance</h3>
<p>By a well-balanced hat is meant one in which the weight or mass on one
side balances the other. For instance, if a mass of trimming is on one side,
there should be more brim on the other to balance it. Color cleverly used
helps in securing proper balance. A bright bit of color which attracts the
attention may outweigh a larger mass on the opposite side of the hat.</p>
<p>One side of a trimmed hat should appear to have the same mass or weight,
if not the same shape, as the other side. Two curves of equal length are not
so good as two of unequal length. Too much contrast or variance is as bad as
too much similarity in a hat.</p>
<h3><a name="adapt" id="adapt"></a>Adapting the Size and Shape of a Hat to the Wearer</h3>
<p>All these relations of line and mass of the hat are most important in
connection with the person who is to wear it. The type of her face, the size
and shape of her head, and her figure must be considered.</p>
<p>A dainty little lady does not look well hidden under a hat too large for
  her.    The husband of a certain woman insisted on her wearing large hats,
  which made her look thin, and she could not change his ideas because she did
  not know enough about form to convince him that he was wrong.</p>
<p>A large woman looks ridiculous in a hat that is either too small or too
large. She should divert attention from her size by avoiding extremes.</p>
<p>A tall, well-proportioned woman, or one of medium height, may wear a large
hat, unless she has a thin face.</p>
<p>A short woman should not be made to look shorter by a flat, low hat, any
more than the height of a tall woman should be much increased by a high
hat.</p>
<p>A hat that extends beyond the width of the shoulders is considered
inartistic.</p>
<p>The lines of the hat when on the head have to be considered in their
relation to the lines of the face in order to bring out good features and to
make poor ones more attractive.</p>
<p>There are a number of general types of faces, but these are sometimes
changed or modified by some unusual element in the face, head, or person, so
that while the following discussion of types and the shapes of hats that suit
them is true in a general way, you will wish to test its application for
yourself. Study the lines of people's hats and see how they affect the faces
of the wearers. You cannot do this in imagination. The best method is to try
hats upon your friends and to analyze the effect of each hat you place upon
the head of a customer.</p>
<h3><a name="full" id="full"></a>The Full, Round Face</h3>
<p>A full, round face needs to have this fullness reduced, so that
threatening fatness may look like soft, normal curves. The face needs
lengthening generally and reducing in size.</p>
<p class="clear"><a name="fig8" id="fig8"></a>For such<strong><a href="illust/08.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,437);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/08-t.jpg" alt="Figure 8" width="140" height="219" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong> a
  face a small hat is bad if it has no brim or a turned-up brim. Medium and large-brimmed
  hats are more becoming. (See Figures 8 and 9.)</p>
<p>A hat with large deep curves would probably not look so well as one with a
moderately curving or a straight brim, as the curves in the face are too
broad already.</p>
<p>A sailor looks well on a woman of this type, and also a brim turned down
slightly on one side and up on the other. It is becoming to have the brim
wider in front than at the sides, as this also lessens the round effect of
the face.</p>
<h5 class="small">Figure 8. A Full Face Cannot Wear a Turban<br />

  Figure 10. A Snub-Nosed Person Should Not Wear a Turban<br />
  Figure 11. A Person with Regular Features Can Wear a Turban
</h5>
<h3><a name="flat" id="flat"></a>Flat Features</h3>
<p>The person with flat features is a type similar to the one with round
features in the treatment needed, so that the same suggestions apply to her.
An oval or a round hat, unless the front is deeper than the back, increases
the flat appearance of her face, but a brim wider in front would be becoming,
unless she had a snub nose.</p>
<h3><a name="snub" id="snub"></a>Snub Noses</h3>
<p>To avoid accentuating a decidedly snub-nose, avoid a crown of round
conical shape or hats that turn up sharply in front, or that have no brim in
front. ( See Figures 10 and 11.) A brim of medium or large size will hide a
snub nose and tend to make it look straighter.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><strong><a href="illust/12.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,362);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/12-t.jpg" alt="Figure 12" width="129" height="239" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong><a name="thinface" id="thinface"></a>The Thin Face</h3>
<p><a name="fig12" id="fig12"></a>Softness can be given to the lower part of a thin face by wearing the hair
low and not too tight upon the head. Waving it helps also.</p>
<p>A small hat with a narrow or up-turned brim is becoming to the thin-faced
woman. (See Figure 12.) She can also wear large crowns and shapes that are
mostly crown. However, her nose may be too sharp or too large for the
up-turned brim in the front of the hat.</p>
<p>A thin face with a sharp prominent nose does not look well in tricorns. A
large hat makes a thin face look too peaked, and small by contrast. (See
Figure 13.)    A small hat brings out all the  fullness and delicacy of curve
that there is.</p>
<p>The oval shape, or one narrower from side to side than from back to front,
is good for her. She should avoid hats with conical crowns.</p>

  Figure 14. An Older Face Needs a Hat Soft in Material and Trimmings<br />
  Figure 15. A Youthful Face Can Wear a Hat with Stiff, Straight Lines in Shape
  and Trimming</h5>
<h3><a name="angular" id="angular"></a>The Angular</h3>
<p>The sharp-featured face offers much the same problem as the thin face but
even more difficulty, for this woman must be careful to choose a hat with no
lines that accentuate the angles of her nose, cheeks, chin, etc.</p>
<p>Softness in the curves and lines of the hat, as well as softness in its
materials, is more becoming to her.</p>
<p>Sharp, stiff, tailored hats are apt to increase her angularity and
thinness.</p>
<p>Velvet and other pile fabrics, and soft straws are more becoming than
stiff, glossy materials.</p>
<h3><a name="age" id="age"></a>Age</h3>
<p>For older people the materials and lines of the hat should be soft, in
order to ease the lines of the face. As has just been said, gloss in
materials usually suggests stiffness.</p>
<p>An elderly face cannot wear a youthful hat with the straight, stiff lines
that the young can stand, but demands moderate, soft curves. (See Figures 14
and 15.)</p>
<p>The large, floppy style that is also becoming to youthful faces is apt to
cast shadows on an older fait and to make its wrinkles look deeper.</p>
<p>Foliage and flowers, graceful feathers, plumes, and soft ribbons make more
becoming styles of trimming than stiffer forms, like stick-ups.</p
><p>Sometimes you will have to suggest hats for a younger face prematurely
aged, with worried, worn lines, which needs the same softening that an older
face does. The old-fashioned type of stiff, little black straw bonnet or hat
for older ladies could not possibly have been more unbecoming, and is rarely
seen now except in cartoons of old maids. Fortunately it is the style for
older people to dress more becomingly at the present time.</p>
<h3 class="clear"><a name="medium" id="medium"></a>Medium <strong><a href="illust/16.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,453);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/16-t.jpg" alt="Figure 16" width="140" height="194" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>Type of Face</h3>
<p><strong><a name="fig16" id="fig16"></a></strong>The face which is neither too full nor too thin, with fairly regular
features, can wear almost any hat, large or small, but the lines and
materials of some bring out good points better than others do.</p>
<p>It is as much a test of skill and good taste to choose an actively
becoming hat for this customer as it is to suit harder types.</p><p>The medium face, as indeed all others, usually looks better if some of the
hair is allowed to show on the forehead below the edge of the hat. No matter
what the style, the hair should never quite touch the eyebrows, as this
destroys their pretty lines. (See Figure 16.)</p>
<h3><a name="extremes" id="extremes"></a>Extremes</h3>
<p>Extremes of any kind are to be avoided, as they are hard to wear and have
to be chosen with great care. Americans usually modify extremes in imported
French hats. Often the too boldly up-flung side of a hat brim imparts a
coarse, aggressive look to the face, instead of the piquant expression a
tastefully turned-up brim would give.</p><p>Whether a woman is rich or poor, it is possible for her to buy a becoming
hat. It all depends upon her taste, and that of the salesperson. A general
smattering of knowledge will not be of much use, but persistent, careful
study on the salesperson's part along the lines suggested will not fail to
develop the ability to choose tasteful and suitable hats for customers.</p>

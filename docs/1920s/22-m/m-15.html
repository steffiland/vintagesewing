<h2>Chapter XV&#8212;MAKING AND TRIMMING HATS</h2>
<h3><a name="relate" id="relate"></a>Relation Between the Saleswoman and the Workroom</h3>
<p>Every Millinery Department has its workroom for the alteration and
trimming of hats, and expert milliners have acquired their skill through a
long course of training. Some salespeople, however, may be used in the
workroom between seasons to their own and the store's advantage, if they know
the simpler points about custom work and have deft fingers.</p><p>Such knowledge will also help them to sell exclusive hats, as they can
point out the differences between these and the more common styles.
Suggestions as to the renovating of hats and trimmings are also useful to the
saleswoman and appreciated by the customer.</p>
<h3><a name="frame" id="frame"></a>Hat Frames</h3>
<p>The foundation of a hand-made hat is usually a frame, which may be altered
from a factory-made frame or made entirely by hand. Hat wire and willow make
a simple and practical foundation which is much used. If a frame is to be
made entirely of wire and then covered with crinoline, frame hat wire, fine
tie wire, and a pair of pliers or pincers are necessary. Measurements are
marked on the inside of the hat to be copied, such as the outside edge of the
brim, the width of the brim in the front, sides, and back, the depth of the
crown, the diameter of the tip of the crown, the size around the top, and the
size of the base of the crown. In instructions given for making hats, these
are called the front brim, back, right, left, head, edge, crown, height of
crown, side to side, etc. In fancy shapes other measurements may be
required.</p>
<h3><a name="buckram" id="buckram"></a>The Buckram or Willow Frame</h3>
<p>A simple frame may be made of willow with a circular or oval piece for the
top of the crown, a piece shaped like a man's collar for the sides of the
crown, and a circular or oval piece with a hole in the center the size of the
head, for the brim. A pattern for the sides of the crown can be made by
cutting a straight piece of paper and pinning many darts in it until it fits
the top of the crown and the head. The edge is wired by sewing edge hat wire
with a strong thread and buttonhole stitch, around the edge of the brim, the
edge of the top of the crown, and the base of the crown.</p>
<p>Buckram is too heavy to be much used, although formerly it was used a
great deal.</p>
<h3><a name="wire" id="wire"></a>The Wire Frame</h3>
<p>In a frame made wholly of wire, the crown and brim may be made together,
or the crown may be completed first and then the brim extended from that. If
crown and brim are made together, a hoop of heavy frame hat wire is made for
the edge of the top of the crown, and another for the base of the crown;
where the hoop ends overlap, fine tie wire is used to hold them in place.
Heavy wire is then used to make the spokes of the cartwheel effect, bent at
right angles over the edge of the top of the crown, and bent out again at the
base of the crown (or otherwise twisted once around the wire at the base of
the crown) to form the brim. Where wires are not twisted but only bent, fine
tie wire must be used to fasten such crossing of wires as the work
progresses. The outer edge of the brim is made by twisting the spokes once
each about the frame hat wire which is being used for the edge of the brim.
The ends of this wire are held together by fine tie wire as stated above. The
ends of the spokes should be cut off in such a way that they do not stick up.
Frame hat wire is then run around the form as often as necessary to make a
firm, circular or oval shape, and a bit of the fine tie wire is used to hold
the crossing wires in place.</p>
<p>If the crown is to be made complete before starting the brim, the crown is
finished off by twisting the spokes about the base, and cutting off their
ends. New spokes then start from about an inch above the base of the crown,
being twisted around the circular wire at that point and the ends cut off,
and at the base are twisted or bent outward at right angles for the brim. The
form is made stronger if the spoke wire is twisted instead of bent.</p>
<p>These frames may be covered with thin crinoline or similar material by
securing with strong thread.</p>
<h3><a name="bow" id="bow"></a>Bows</h3>
<p>Some standard bows are the rosette, loop rosette, butterfly bow, tied bow,
Alsatian, and fan-shaped bow.
</p><p>There are a few tricks in making bows. The simple cravat bow is one that
everyone knows how to make. Upon its evenness and grace depends its
attractiveness.</p>
<p>Rosettes may be made in several ways. A common way is to fold a ribbon in
ten or twelve even lengths, hold them together evenly and smoothly, and tie
or sew another bit of ribbon about the center of the loops. The loops can be
pulled out into various shapes, flat or stand-up.</p>
<p>A method which will make a perfectly uniform and even rosette, with the
same side of the ribbon always out, is to measure the loops of ribbon half
the length of the rosette just described, that is, not measuring for a double
loop but for a single one. The ribbon will be folded flat back and forth
about twenty times. With needle and thread every other crease is caught
together, forming a straight series of loops. Different effects are obtained
either by drawing the threads tight at the base of the loops or by leaving
the base ungathered, just sewed flat. This method is used for making only two
or three loops for a large stick-up, or for any series of loops. If the
series of loops is to form a rosette, the length of loops is twisted
circularly and caught with a thread. Some bows are made of ribbon wired and
glued together to give the effect of a bow.</p>
<p>One can practice bow-making with paper, old ribbon, or a strip of narrow
cloth. Some bows need wire tacked on the inside to hold them erect.</p>
<h3><a name="affix" id="affix"></a>Method of Affixing Trimmings</h3>
<p>Formerly all trimming was sewn to the hat, but now there are a number of
kinds of "Milliner's Glue," or cement, which is used a great deal in
fastening flowers, ribbons, etc., to the hat. These liquids must resist
moisture, not injure the materials, be permanent, and have a strong adhesive
power.</p>
<p>Often trimmings are attached to the hat by slipping them through slits in
the hat itself.</p>
<h3><a name="linings" id="linings"></a>Linings</h3>
<p>Mercerized materials and China and taffeta silks are generally used for
hat linings. These are of two styles. One style is drawn up in the center by
a thread or tape and fastened to the apex of the crown. The other fitted
style is very much like the linings in men's hats; it is in two pieces, one
placed flat on the inside of the crown, the other placed around the sides of
the crown and attached to the other piece. Linings should be put in slightly
above the base of the crown so as not to show.</p>
<p>Maline is used for lining transparent hats. Satin and ribbon are now used
also. Linings usually match the hat in color.</p>
<p>Some workrooms buy linings all ready to sew in, and it takes a skilful
girl between a minute and a half and four minutes to sew one in.</p>
<h3><a name="fresh" id="fresh"></a>Freshening and Cleaning</h3>
<p>Customers will appreciate information upon the care and cleaning of
millinery. The saleswoman should be able to tell her some ways of doing this
at home.</p>
<p>To freshen velvet and to take out the creases, it is steamed. A good
method for the amateur is to run it back and forth over the open top or spout
of a kettle of boiling water. Pressing velvet on the surface with a hot iron
lays the nap flat and makes a glossy panne velvet effect. If the nap is not
to be laid flat it must not be ironed on the right side except with a cool
iron.</p>
<p>Straw hats may be cleaned with a good soap and warm water, then bleached,
stuffed with coarse paper to restore the shape, and dried in the sun. This
method gives a cream-white result. A dead white is obtained by the use of
oxalic acid, but this is not good for the straw. Lemon juice is a good bleach
for hats. A faded colored straw may be improved with a fresh coat of shellac
polish made for the purpose. The way in which hats are put away has a great
deal to do with their preservation and fresh appearance. It preserves the
shape of a hat to put it on a form, or pin it up by the inside, so that the
brim is not allowed to support it.</p><p>The curling of feathers is rather difficult as an amateur is apt to break
the flues. Several flues are pulled together between the thumb and the back
of the knife; this process is repeated until the flues are sufficiently
curled.</p>
<p>Although    bleaching    feathers    requires    chemical knowledge, white
feathers that are soiled and yellow may be improved immensely by scrubbing
them with castile soap and warm water, and after rinsing dyeing them the
faintest blue.</p>
<p>Feathers may be dyed in the lighter shades by following the methods
adopted by professional dyers as given in <a href="m-08.html#dyeing">Chapter VIII</a>.    About two-thirds
of a teaspoonful of either formic or oxalic acid in a pint of water will set
the dye for one or two feathers.</p>

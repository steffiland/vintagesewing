<h2>Chapter V&#8212;MACHINE-MADE STRAW HATS</h2>
<h3><a name="dev" id="dev"></a>Development of Industry</h3>
<p>The word "manufacture" is applied to the making of hats whether by hand or
by machine, but having considered typical methods of making hats and braids
by hand, we shall now take up the methods of making and treating hats in
factories.</p>
<p>Factory hat manufacture is a development of the last century, and the
number, extent, and variety of hat factories, not only in the United States,
but throughout the civilized world, are surprisingly large. A hat factory is
a most interesting and instructive place to visit, especially if one knows
beforehand something about the processes and the reasons for them.</p>
<h3><a name="locf" id="locf"></a>Location of Factories</h3>
<p>In general, the countries which produce the most raw material for hats are
those which have the greatest number of factories, except the small countries
like the Philippines, where the population is not yet industrial but mainly
agricultural. All large countries which are industrially developed
manufacture hats, and thus, although the United States produces almost no raw
material for hats except cotton, wool, and fur, it has many hat factories.</p>
<p>Very few machine-stitched braid hats are imported; most hats of this sort
are made here from imported braids.</p>
<h3><a name="diff" id="diff"></a>Different Kinds of Factories</h3>
<p>The modern hat factory has many specialized departments and a highly
organized staff of employees. There are various types of factories and
establishments connected directly with the hat industry. They may be
classified as follows:</p>
<ol><li>Foreign houses that receive braids and body hats and ship them after
putting them through the finishing processes of dyeing, bleaching, and
blocking. Such houses flourish in ports of China, Japan, and other countries
that export large quantities of hats. There are many in the United
States.</li>
<li>Factories that make up braids into hats and occasionally handle imported
body hats. These buy almost exclusively from importers of braids and body
hats in the rough.</li>
<li>Felt, pile fabric, and silk hat factories, which may or may not be
associated with the straw factories.</li>
<li>Millinery shops and factories, including department store workrooms,
where untrimmed hats are trimmed, hats are made of braid by hand on wire,
buckram, or net frames, imported models copied, etc.</li>
<li>Importers and manufacturers of flowers, foliage, feathers, trimmings,
ornaments, novelties, ribbons, silk goods, maline, etc.</li>
<li>Manufacturers of hat frames, hat linings, bandeaux, etc.</li>
<li>Manufacturers of dye, finishes, lacquers, glue, cement, sizing, varnish,
dies, plaster blocks, sewing machines, etc., for use in hat factories.</li>
<li>A description of the second class of factories will include the methods
of the first class.</li></ol>
<h3><a name="receive" id="receive"></a>Receiving the Braids</h3>
<p class="clear"><strong><a name="fig5" id="fig5"></a><a href="illust/05.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',535,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/05-t.jpg" alt="Figure 5" width="215" height="140" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>The braids, which are received in bales or cases (see Figure 5), generally
come in pieces 60 yards in length, weighing one-fourth of a pound.
Manufacturers often order 10,000 pieces at once. Tagal braid from Japan comes
25 pieces of 80 yards each to a bundle, and 1,000 pieces to a box. Chinese
braid is tied up into pieces 60 or 120 yards long, with 240 pieces to the
bale. The larger manufacturers employ "graders" to separate the grades of
braid into several classes. The contents of each bale vary in quality, some
finer and some coarser, and in width. The value is set according to quality.
This careful standardization makes uniform prices for material of one
quality, and one customer or retailer cannot complain that his shipment of
hats is inferior to another at the same price.</p>
<h3><a name="sewing" id="sewing"></a>Sewing the Braid into Hats</h3>
<p>The manufacturers generally make up hats in quantity only as orders are
received. Large factories with sufficient capital to risk, sometimes make up
what is known as "floor" goods, anticipating the demand for a few shapes.
Each operator works on one special model, and is usually given enough braid
to make at least four dozen of the desired type of hat. The hats are shaped
from a plaster block which is given to the operator, and changed whenever a
new shape is wanted. Sometimes manufacturers make hats up ahead of time,
copying and modifying imported models, but more often they are behind or just
even with their orders.</p>
<p>The operators work in a large, light room on power sewing machines of a
special make, that sew either by lock or chain stitch. The plaster blocks by
which the operators shape the hats have been molded by plasterers in another
part of the factory into the exact shapes desired. These shapes are generally
either copies of imported models or adaptations of them, as imported styles
are apt to be too extreme for the American taste. The operator wets the braid
and sews with great rapidity and deftness. It is interesting to know that the
sewers receive more per yard for sewing by machine than the woman received
for plaiting the braid by hand in distant China.</p>
<h3><a name="sizing" id="sizing"></a>Sizing</h3>
<p>The sewed hats are then taken to the sizing room, where they are dipped
into a kind of starch to stiffen them. The luster and stiffness of the
finished hat depend very largely upon the kind of sizing used.</p>
<h3><a name="block" id="block"></a>Blocking</h3>
<p>The hats are dried on shelves placed one above another in the drying room
and are then passed to the blocking department, where they are fitted upon
hot metal blocks exactly similar in shape to the plaster blocks which guided
the sewing of the braid. The blocks are placed in presses or stampers, which
work by hydraulic pressure. Hydraulic presses are used for hats requiring a
smooth finish, and stem machines for hats that are to have a rough effect.
The hydraulic pressure is 75 to 100 pounds, much less than is used on a felt
hat, where it is often 500 pounds. This operation presses the hats into the
shape of the metal die, which when it is made of zinc spelter averages 110
pounds in weight.</p>
<h3><a name="addl" id="addl"></a>Additional Blocking</h3>
<p>An additional process is applied to more expensive grades of hats, which
necessitates more expense, more workers and consequently raises the price of
the hat. After the hats are taken from the presses they are put on other
blocks on a hot table, which is usually of steel, about thirty feet long and
four or five feet wide, and is heated from underneath by gas or steam. This
assures a perfectly formed hat.</p>
<h3><a name="finish" id="finish"></a>Finishing</h3>
<p>The hats are then ready for ticketing and lining.</p>
<p>The crowns and brims of certain hats are made separately and then sewn
together. Finer grades and Panamas are blocked by hand; wooden blocks, which
rest on the hot table, are sometimes used.</p>
<h3><a name="sewedb" id="sewedb"></a>Sewed Braids</h3>
<p>In recent years narrow braids have been used to a great extent. There are,
however, many millinery concerns which make hand-sewed hats of wide braids;
such as those of artificial silk, ramie, open work hair, and lace Tuscan. To
supply the demand of these shops for wide braids and at the same time to meet
the requirements of fashion, the straw factories produce bolts of braid which
give an effect of three, four, or five rows of narrow braid.</p>

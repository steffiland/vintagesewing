<h2>Chapter VII&#8212;VELVET AND OTHER FABRIC HATS</h2>
<h3><a name="use" id="use"></a>Use of Velvet and Other Fabrics in Hats</h3>
<p>Velvet is used a great deal for hats and hat trimmings. It has been
popular for headgear since it was introduced in England at the time of the
Norman Conquest, when the men of the nobility wore bright colored clothing
and caps or bonnets of velvet adorned with long plumes.</p>
<h3><a name="manup" id="manup"></a>Manufacture of Pile Fabrics</h3>
<p>Velvet is called a pile fabric because of the soft nap or pile which hides
the cloth that forms the back of the material. The back of almost all velvet
is of cotton; the pile is of silk. The pile is formed by carrying part of the
warp thread over a wire and cutting the loops afterwards, or by a special
double-cloth weaving process. (See the manual for the "Silk Department" for a
more extended description of velvet weaving.)</p>
<h3><a name="detq" id="detq"></a>Ways to Determine Quality of Velvet</h3>
<p>There are a number of ways to tell a good piece of velvet, although it is
rather difficult for an amateur to do so. The closeness of weave of the back
is one indication of the quality. The two principal kinds of weaves are the
German and the Lyons. Both kinds are made in America. The Lyons weave, which
is named for a French city which is a great silk and velvet center, is
generally the best. The backs of the two kinds look slightly different, as
may be seen by examining them; the Lyons velvet is usually lighter in weight,
and the back shows through the nap more. Of two grades of Lyons velvet the
more expensive has the thicker pile and shows the back less. The thickness of
the nap may be clearly seen by folding a piece of the velvet to determine how
much the back shows through on the fold.</p>
<p>Uncut velvet is sometimes used.</p>
<p>The quality of silk from which velvet is made has much to do with the
value of the finished article. Pure silk from silk-worms fed on mulberry
trees, and reeled in great lengths from the cocoons, is the best. The waste
silk&#8212;that made from pierced cocoons from which the moth has
escaped&#8212;and other inferior kinds, are called schappe (spun) silks and
do not make so fine an article. Although cotton is commonly used for the
backs, manufacturers used to speak of a good piece of velvet as
"linen-backed," to indicate superior quality.</p>
<h3><a name="manuv" id="manuv"></a>Manufacture of Velvet Hats</h3>
<p>Formerly, even in factories, all velvet hats had to be made by hand; the
operators stretched and pinned the velvet onto wire and net frames. At every
place where there was a dip in the shape, the velvet had to be tacked by
hand. This made the hats more expensive and the effect was not quite so
smooth and tailored as that obtained today by a new method, by which the
velvet is pressed onto buckram or willow frames containing glue. The heat in
the dies brings out the glue, which, however, does not come through the
fabric. This makes the velvet conform easily and exactly to the shape of the
frame. The finish of the velvet is slightly affected by this method, but not
enough to damage it.</p>
<p>Hand-made velvet hats are often made over wire frames which are usually
bought from factories. It is not a very difficult piece of work to make a
frame, and anyone who is skilful with her fingers can do it. Strong wire is
used and with a pair of pliers tiny thread wire is twisted around each place
where the larger wires cross, to hold them in place. This method is taught in
millinery classes. (For further information in regard to making hat frames
see <a href="m-15.html#frame">Chapter XV</a>.)</p>
<h3><a name="silk" id="silk"></a>Silk and Satin Hats</h3>
<p>Silk hats are worn between seasons when people are tired of straw or
velvet. Of late years satin has been in favor. Satin is a silk, of course,
but the weave is usually one thread under and five to seven over, so that the
extreme glossiness of the smooth silk fibers is preserved. In a taffeta,
where the weave is simply over one and under one (simple or tabby weave) much
of the gloss is lost. The more tightly the silk threads are twisted, the
stronger they become but more of the shimmer is lost.</p>
<h3><a name="durab" id="durab"></a>Durability of Silk Hats</h3>
<p>If the public were more particular about the wearing qualities of a hat,
it would pay the salespeople to know thoroughly all about the durability of
the popular kinds of fabrics, but the average customer merely wants
reasonable service from a hat, as she tires of it, or the season changes
before she wears it out. So the appeal of length of service cannot be made to
many customers. When it does appeal to a customer, the price of a hat is a
fairly sure indication of the value.</p>
<h3><a name="weighted" id="weighted"></a>Weighted Silk</h3>
<p>A stiff silk like a taffeta is apt to crack and wear out sooner than a
soft silk of the same value, owing to the weighting or loading of the former.
Silk fiber has the power of absorbing certain metals in solution. The stiffer
and cheaper the silk, the more metal (salts of lead) has been absorbed into
the fiber in its making, and the more this so-called weighting will cause the
fiber to crack and wear out. Dark dyes absorb weighting more readily than
light. If you wish to test any piece of silk for the amount of weighting,
burn a small piece with a match. If a soft gray ash is left, the silk was of
good quality, but if there is a stiff black metal framework left after the
silk has burned away, the piece was heavily weighted.</p>
<p>See manual for the "Silk Department" for further information on the
weighting of silks.</p>
<p>Silk is used in mourning hats, often in such materials as faille or peau
de soie, although the materials vary with different years. Silk is used
chiefly in millinery shops and workrooms, especially for the more dressy
hats. Silk or satin hats are usually trimmed very simply, perhaps because of
the natural beauty of the silk. Many hats are made with combinations of silk
or with a brim lining of silk, silk bows, or ribbons. Hat linings are of thin
unweighted silks, such as China silks, mercerized cotton, or soft taffeta,
that wear well, stand pin holes, and give the hat a good finish.</p>
<h3><a name="otherf" id="otherf"></a>Other Fabric Hats</h3>
<p>Every year sees new varieties of fabric hats, made of chiffon, tulle,
maline, cotton cr&ecirc;pes, georgettes, silk ginghams, pongees, lace, net, silver
cloth, and cloth of gold. Outing types, as the so-called sport hats, are
simple in trimming and finish, often stiff in outline, and made of such
materials as crash, duck, eponge, linen, rep, etc. High-grade linen hats are
hand-blocked in the factories. The most expensive linen or cotton hats are
made in workrooms, and in some years hardly appear at all. Embroidered hats
follow the fashion.</p>
<p>In material, form, and general style, fabric hats vary every season. They
form a most important part of the millinery trade. A study of textiles would
be helpful to anyone who wishes to become well informed on the subject of
fabric hats. (See manuals for the "Silk" and "Cotton and Linen"
Departments.)</p>
<h3><a name="newm" id="newm"></a>New Materials</h3>
<p>An illustration of the new materials that are brought out now and then for
hats is Pontine, a fabric manufactured by the Dupont Powder Mills. This
material has a silk or satin surface on one side, usually of some pretty
color, and on the other side resembles leather. It is made from the waste
obtained in the manufacture of gunpowder. Its water-proof, light, flexible
qualities make it a desirable material not only for hats but for other
purposes, such as motor coats. Whether this article and other novelty
materials will win a permanent  place on the market and have a steady demand
yearly, remains to be seen.</p>
<h3><a name="furhat" id="furhat"></a>Fur Hats</h3>
<p>Whole hats and parts of hats are made of fur for winter wear. A few appear
even in the extreme southern part of the United States. Several kinds of fur
were mentioned in <a href="m-06.html">Chapter VI</a>.</p>
<p>Fur hats are usually close-fitting and small, or else the crown only is
covered with fur, because of the warmth and bulk of the fur. Some furs are
heavy, but the lighter varieties are most used. White fur is popular for
dressy hats. Much more fur is used in  trimming than in body hats. Fur is
used in band, crowns, tufts, or brims are faced with fur.</p>
<h3><a name="misc" id="misc"></a>Miscellaneous Fabrics</h3>
<p>Hats are also made whole, or in part of velour, moir&eacute;, satin cire, Angora
cloth, duvetyne, hatter's plush, bullion cloths, metallic cloths, jet cloth,
celophane combined with metallic threads, panne, French kid, wool, taffeta,
satin, georgette, and others. Some of these, such as wool and Angora cloth,
leather, or imitation leather, are for sport hats.</p>

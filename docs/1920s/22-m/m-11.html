<h2>Chapter XI&#8212;CHOOSING A BECOMING HAT</h2>
<h3><a name="choice" id="choice"></a>Importance of the Choice</h3>
<p>The chief requisite of a hat is that it shall be becoming. Some people
find it very easy to select a becoming hat; others hunt for one in vain. Many
people do not wear the hat most suited to their coloring, their clothes, or
the shape of their heads and features. Unless special attention has been
given to the study of these things the disturbing element may not be noticed,
even though the effect as a whole is unpleasing.</p>
<h3><a name="taste" id="taste"></a>Good Taste</h3>
<p>It is current opinion that "good taste" or a sense of what is becoming in
clothes and hats is inborn, and that those who lack this desirable faculty
have no alternative but to do the best they can and to depend on the variable
advice of others. Perhaps the majority of people belong to the second class,
but it is comforting to know that it is possible to cultivate one's
perception of beauty in form and color by study, observation, and the
knowledge of a few simple rules that generally hold good.    "Good taste"
thus becomes an acquired trait.</p>
<h3><a name="cause" id="cause"></a>The Cause of Bad Taste</h3>
<p>When we see about us all our lives mediocre or poor taste rather than
beauty in architecture, household furnishing, wallpapers, and carpets, it is
small wonder that we often choose wrongly when it comes to our clothes.    We
think of the clothes themselves and forget that they should chiefly be a
background for our persons.    Do we  realize,   for instance,  that a mere
change in the line of a collar will change the whole appearance of a face?</p>
<p>It would be fascinating to take up the questions of line and color with
regard to the whole costume, but in this and the next few chapters only the
lines of the head and face are studied as these are the important ones in
choosing a hat. However, a mastery of these principles will enable one to
carry the study further, and perhaps to dress more becomingly.</p>
<h3><a name="duty" id="duty"></a>The Duty of Women to be Beautiful</h3>
<p>It is the duty of every woman to attire herself as charmingly as possible,
for the pleasure of her friends and all who come in contact with her as well
as to aid her advancement in any calling. It is hard not to be self-conscious
when unsuitably dressed. It is embarrassing to feel either that clothes are
not becoming or that the costume selected is inappropriate for the
occasion.</p>
<h3><a name="imp" id="imp"></a>Importance of a Hat in a Costume</h3>
<p>One jarring note in a costume will spoil the effect of the whole, and
frequently this jarring note is the hat. By paying a high price one can
usually secure a becoming hat, but there are many people who do not wish to
pay a high price and yet want a satisfactory article. It takes more skill to
make a good choice in an inexpensive hat because the designers and the
milliners who make such hats are not high-class workers and the materials
from which the hats are made are not of the first quality.</p>
<p>Materials count less in millinery than style. A customer is apt to care
less about the hat's wearing qualities than about its style and becomingness.
These are the chief requisites in her mind, no matter whether she admits it
or not, though most women do admit it quite freely.</p>
<h3><a name="part" id="part"></a>The Saleswoman's Part in Selecting a Hat</h3>
<p>The average salesperson knows this and her chief exclamations as she tries
hats upon her customer are, "How well that suits you," "How pretty that looks
on you," "This is becoming." Remarks of this sort, however, are so often
accompanied by an unbecoming hat, one which the customer knows is not
suitable to her, that customers are apt to be cynical and no longer believe
the saleswoman's statements. The only remedy for this distrust is for the
salespeople to know why a hat is becoming or the reverse, and then to be
truthful in the matter. One remark setting forth the good points of the hat
and calling attention to the becoming features would prevent the loss of many
a sale and save the customer from fruitless wandering among the stores with
the idea that she is hard to suit.</p>
<p>If saleswomen cultivate their observation and judgment of pretty and
suitable things, this knowledge will not only bring them pleasure but will
help them to build up a following of customers who have confidence in them.
Rare is the salesgirl who does not have at least a few customers who ask for
her because they like her personality and prompt attention, but the woman who
is in demand chiefly for her good judgment, and who is a recognized
authority, has countless followers and success attends her.</p>
<h3><a name="line" id="line"></a>Line and Color in Millinery</h3>
<p>Good lines and the right choice of color or of color combinations may seem
to be matters of accident, and one time in a hundred they may be, but the
other ninety-nine times they are the result of careful study and
observations. One salesgirl was sent by her store in the Middle West to study
costume designing in New York because she took such an interest in advising
customers as to colors and ways of making the silk piece goods she sold that
the store wished to make her a service specialist.</p>
<h3><a name="observe" id="observe"></a>Observation and Study of Dress</h3>
<p>The woman who wishes to acquire excellent taste must be observant of all
she sees, especially in matters of dress. When she sees a passer-by, she
might ask herself: "Is that the most becoming costume that woman could wear?
Could I suggest any little improvement? Is the color of her hat the best for
her complexion, eyes, hair, and costume? What kind of hat would I choose for
her?"</p>
<p>At first your criticisms will be mostly destructive and you may think that
nine people out of ten are poorly dressed, but as you study the problem your
criticisms will grow more constructive and you will think of changes for the
better in the things you observe. As you think of your friends, have you
noticed that some of them are more observant than others, that maybe one of
them gets more pleasure than others out of a window, a shopping tour, or a
walk on the avenue and that her quick eyes miss nothing of interest? It is
just this quality of quick observation and alertness that should be
cultivated in studying the scientific principles of becoming dress.</p>
<h3><a name="style" id="style"></a>Style in Millinery</h3>
<p>Style is an important element in millinery, but that alone should not
decide the choice of a hat. The argument for style, though a good one, ought
not to be made the chief or only one, for there are many stylish hats in
every display and it is quite possible to choose one that is becoming as well
as stylish.</p>
<p>It often prejudices a woman when a saleswoman displays a hat with the
remark, "This is very stylish," or "This is very dressy." The saleswoman
should give reasons for her statement, or she misses an opportunity and fails
to impress the customer with her knowledge and good judgment.</p>
<p>Women are interested to know what is new and in the best style, and most
of them glean this information from their observations in the stores and from
the assertions of salespeople rather than from fashion magazines and papers.
Do not real articles make more impression on you than pictures of them?</p>
<h3><a name="change" id="change"></a>Change in Styles</h3>
<p>On the other hand, styles change very rapidly in the Millinery Department,
and therefore the saleswoman should be careful not to be too much influenced
by what is new. It is easy to become tired of hats that have been in the
department for some time and consequently to neglect them and to push only
the "very latest." This complicates the manager's problem of slow-moving
merchandise.</p>
<p>The salesperson with natural or cultivated good taste does not fall into
this habit, because she is more interested in what is beautiful than in what
is merely new. It is well to see and observe the new things and to decide
about them, considering what type of person ought to wear this hat or that,
perhaps having such accurate taste that one can think, "This is the very hat
for my customer, Mrs. S.!" One might then call up Mrs. S. about it, provided
one knew that she would like the attention, and thereby make a sale as well
as render a service. This method of making sales is practiced far more in
other departments than in the Millinery Department.</p>
<h3><a name="extreme" id="extreme"></a>Extreme and Conservative Styles</h3>
<p>Another consideration in regard to style is the purse of the customer. If
she intends to have a number of hats, she can afford to purchase one that is
rather extreme in style because she will have several changes. To be very
stylish, a hat must be rather distinctive, but one quickly tires of something
that is rather extreme unless one has something else to change to.</p>
<h3><a name="suit" id="suit"></a>Suitability</h3>
<p>Of the Millinery Department in a large and successful store, many women
say: "The only trouble with that millinery section is that none of the
salesgirls know what is suitable. They try <em>anything</em> on you." The department
evidently lacks a right adjustment to its customers, a personal feeling of
good taste and helpful service. The fact that for building up a permanent
trade a satisfied customer is worth more in the long run than a sale, has not
occurred to one of those salespeople. Each one is working very shortsightedly
to fill up her book for the day, not to increase her individual sales on the
morrow.</p>
<h3><a name="self" id="self"></a>Putting One's Self in the Customer's Place</h3>
<p>Have you ever been shopping yourself and had something shown you that
appealed greatly to the one who was displaying it, which suited her fancy,
but did not agree with your idea at all? The saleswoman who was waiting on
you was not able to put herself in your place? She was deficient in judgment,
although this is a quality which anyone can cultivate.</p>
<h3><a name="cons" id="cons"></a>What Constitutes a Suitable Hat</h3>
<p>To be suitable, the hat purchased must go well with the suit or dresses to
be worn with it, and a distinction must be made as to its purpose, whether it
is to be used for street, afternoon, or evening wear, or for a combination of
these.</p>
<h3><a name="age" id="age"></a>Suiting the Age of a Customer</h3>
<p>Another important consideration in choosing a suitable hat for a customer
is her apparent age. Have you sometimes seen young girls wearing hats far too
old for them, or an older woman made almost ridiculous by one too frivolous
for her, one that tended to accentuate her age by contrast with its own
youthfulness of appearance? Suiting a hat to a person's years requires a
knowledge of color, of line and of form, which we shall discuss later; with
such knowledge anyone can decide whether or not a hat is suitable to the age
of the wearer.</p>
<h3><a name="becoming" id="becoming"></a>Actively Becoming Hats</h3>
<p>One very well-dressed woman, whom it is always a pleasure to look at, said
one day: "I never buy anything because it is becoming. It must be <em>actively</em> becoming.
I must look better in it than without it. It must <em>add</em> to my
appearance." Are any of your articles of clothing of this nature that they
make you seem even better looking than you are, that is, subdue your
indifferent points and bring out the good ones? It is a good test question to
ask yourself when you are trying hats upon yourself or upon anyone else: "Is
this <em>actively</em> becoming?"</p>
<p>No two faces are alike, any more than two personalities. Every woman wants
a hat that is distinctive. It may occasion Mrs. Jones a great deal of pique
if she finds that her neighbor Mrs. Henry has a hat exactly like hers. So the
Millinery Department puts the appeal of exclusiveness above all others, and
in addition strives to present so large a variety of becoming hats that every
customer can make a choice suitable to her age and appearance.</p>
<h3><a name="choosing" id="choosing"></a>The Most Important Elements in Choosing a Hat</h3>
<p>Color and form are the most important elements to consider in choosing a
becoming hat. While the quality of the materials, their softness and gloss,
influence the appearance of a hat a great deal, these are not so essential to
its becoming appearance as are color and form. Color is the simpler of these
two elements for most people, because it is only a matter of persistent
eye-training.</p>

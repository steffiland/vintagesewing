<h2>Chapter IX&#8212;HAT TRIMMINGS&#8212;FLOWERS</h2>
<h3><a name="sources" id="sources"></a>Sources of Artificial Flowers</h3>
<p>Until recent years almost all fine flowers were made abroad, chiefly in
France. The Italians were the first people in Europe to excel in the art of
flower-making, and later the French became very proficient. Germany and
Austria made a great many of the lower priced ones.</p>
<p>Almost all small flowers, such as forget-me-nots, heliotrope, verbenas,
lilacs, and wisteria were made in Europe until the war. Since then they have
been well made in the United States, for the most part in and about New York,
Philadelphia, St. Louis and Chicago. Violets, however, have long been made
here by Italians. Roses and other fine flowers are made here also.</p>
<p>In former years much artificial flower-making was performed by sweat-shop
labor in places which were often unsanitary. In English trade schools fifty
years ago children were taught the craft and allowed to work as soon as they
were able to move their fingers accurately, even at the early age of three.
It is a relief to know that today most of the work has been taken over by
factories. It is hard to supervise the sanitary conditions under which work
is done in homes.</p>
<h3><a name="flower" id="flower"></a>Flower Materials</h3>
<p>The materials generally used in flower-making are muslin, silk, satin,
velvet, and velveteen; but tinsel-cloth, ribbon, chenille, leather,
celluloid, straw, cr&ecirc;pe, felt, and feathers are also occasionally seen. The
great majority of flowers are made of a thin, fine muslin such as batiste or
nainsook.</p>
<h3><a name="stiff" id="stiff"></a>Stiffening and Cutting Out</h3>
<p>The white muslin is first stretched on a frame and brushed with a mixture
of starch and gelatin to stiffen it and to give the proper finish. The
patterns of the flowers are then cut out. If they are to be "specialty"
flowers, they are cut out by means of a die pounded by hand with a heavy
mallet, but the less expensive ones are stamped out by machine. The layers of
stiffened cloth are placed one above another and from half a dozen to
seventy-two petals may be cut at one time.</p>
<h3><a name="dye" id="dye"></a>Dyeing</h3>
<p>They are then separated and dyed in bowls according to a color chart
which, in the better factories, comes from Paris. The shading is done by
dipping a brush into a deeper color and touching the flowers with it while
they are still wet. The color spreads and shades off in a very natural way.
Fine flowers are finished with a stencil, or are hand-painted. The finished
petals are laid on sheets of blotting paper and dried either in the air or in
ovens by artificial heat.</p>
<h3><a name="making" id="making"></a>Making</h3>
<p>Many flowers are cut in flat circular pieces with a hole in the center and
the petals only partly formed. These are called "slip-ups." The flower-maker
takes a bunch of "peps" or flower seed pods, which come already prepared, and
fastens them to a wire. She then slips the number of circles required upon
the wire, puts on a little paste, and finishes off the stem. If flowers are
cut in separate petals, these petals must be pasted on one at a time. When
separate petals are cut they are pinched into shape or "goffered" with
pincers or a hot iron to give them a natural curl. The slight pull and twist
which an expert can give a rose leaf changes it from a flat piece of muslin
into a perfectly curved petal.</p>
<p>The stamping machine also cuts out, dyes, and veins the leaves. The stems
are wound with some material or covered with a tube of green rubber
composition.</p>
<p>There are various finishing processes, such as gumming, waxing, and
dusting. Powdered glass gives a frosted effect. Fine cambric is used to a
great extent for petals, and silk in expensive flowers, with sometimes a
gauzy net backing to give strength and shape. Taffeta and velvet are much
used for leaves.</p>
<p>The flowers made in this country are not yet equal to the best French
flowers, as we are not willing to give the time necessary to do artistic
work. In France the workman is an artist who imitates nature as carefully as
if he were painting a picture. The last touches are put on with the living
model before him or from a perfect copy. A flower-maker is usually kept at
work on one kind of flower, i.e., a rose-maker always makes roses and a
violet-maker violets. They naturally become very expert, but operators who
are constantly changing their work cannot produce such results.</p>
<h3><a name="how" id="how"></a>How Flowers Come to the Milliner</h3>
<p>There are a number of forms in which flowers come to the milliner for use.
They are put up singly, or in bunches, sprays, clusters, or groups of one
kind to be opened and used as desired by the trimmer; or flowers and foliage
which blend as to kind and color are combined in wreaths, bouquets, or
clusters, thus forming a trimming ready to be applied without further
blending or combining on the part of the milliner.</p>
<p>The kinds of flowers in general use may be classed:</p>
<ul><li>Roses</li>
<li>Field flowers</li>
<li>Applique flowers</li>
<li>Violets</li>
<li>Small flowers</li>
<li>Odd flowers</li>
<li>Rare flowers</li>
<li>Natural flowers</li>
<li>Foliage</li>
<li>Fruits</li></ul>
<h3><a name="rose" id="rose"></a>Roses</h3>
<p>Roses come in large, medium, and small June sizes. They are crushed for
applique trimming with or without foliage, with or without combinations, with
forget-me-nots, cowslips, or similar small flowers. American Beauty,
LaFrance, Neron, cabbage, or other round or flat shapes with either foliage
or ribbon, or both, are used for trimmings of softer effects. They are
sometimes combined with other flowers in wreaths or standing clusters. June
roses are used principally for children's or misses' hats or for mixing in
tight bouquets.</p>
<h3><a name="field" id="field"></a>Field Flowers</h3>
<p>Poppies,   bluets,   daisies,   buttercups,   and  pansies vary greatly as
to size. Large single daisies and poppies are frequently used for appliques.
Field flowers are generally used, however, in combination, frequently with
foliage. The small and medium sizes are almost always used for misses',
children's, and sport hats; although the dainty, small clusters are used on
the dressier styles as well.</p>
<h3><a name="appliq" id="appliq"></a>Applique Flowers</h3>
<p>Dahlias, asters, camelias, gardenias, chrysanthemums, and poppies are used
almost altogether in applique.</p>
<h3><a name="viol" id="viol"></a>Violets</h3>
<p>Parma, wood, and Russian violets are frequently combined with roses or
other flowers, and are used principally on early spring hats. Trimmings of
all violets are usually confined to matrons' hats, except occasionally in
outlining the edge of a large, drooping brim.</p>
<h3><a name="small" id="small"></a>Small Flowers</h3>
<p>Forget-me-nots, heliotropes, verbenas, cowslips, primroses, lilies of the
valley, hyacinths, etc., and blossoms are generally used in combination with
other flowers, either as the basis of trimming or in branch form.</p>
<h3><a name="odd" id="odd"></a>Odd Flowers</h3>
<p>Lilacs, wisteria, orchids, hydrangeas, and sweet peas are used at times.
These are especially subject to the changes of fashion; sometimes they are in
great demand and in some seasons not employed at all. While they are
frequently used as the basic trimming, they are generally combined with other
flowers. They are especially adapted to toque and turban trimmings, although
when in style they are used on hats of various shapes. Nasturtiums, apple
blossoms, and baby's breath are also used somewhat.</p>
<h3><a name="rare" id="rare"></a>Rare Flowers</h3>
<p>Narcissi, fuchsias, jonquils, water lilies, and pond lilies are not very
generally used, but when fashionable they offer a decided relief from the
more conventional kinds of artificial flowers.</p>
<h3><a name="natural" id="natural"></a>Natural Flowers</h3>
<p>Natural ferns, sea moss, wheat, and mignonette are often used after being
dried and treated. Most of these are also reproduced artificially.</p>
<h3><a name="foli" id="foli"></a>Foliage</h3>
<p>Foliage of all kinds is used in branching the various flowers with which
it is found in nature. In some seasons, however, entire hats or entire crowns
are made of foliage, or the crown edges or the brims are outlined with
foliage. Entire hats are also made of flowers which are sewed flat to the
frames and relieved with a little satin or velvet ribbon or an aigrette. </p>
<h3><a name="fruit" id="fruit"></a>Fruits</h3>
<p>Several kinds of fruits, such as grapes, cherries, small apples, peaches,
and oranges, are used in trimmings.</p>

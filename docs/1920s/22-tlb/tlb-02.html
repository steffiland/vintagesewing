  <h3><a name="remarks" id="remarks"></a>REMARKS</h3>
  <p> 38. In dressmaking, the term <strong>boning</strong> means the stiffening,
    or staying, of one part of a garment so that it will retain its shape and
    act as a support
    for another. At one time, whalebone was the only available stiffening medium,
    but an excellent substitute, namely, featherbone, so called from the fact
    that it is made of strips of feather quills woven together with linen thread,
    has been brought out; indeed, featherbone has proved to be so superior to
  whalebone that the latter is seldom if ever used.</p>
  <p> Besides being costly, whalebone is unsatisfactory to handle. Strips of
    it cut into the desired lengths must be inserted into casings that are made
    long enough and wide enough to hold it; and to put them in a garment so that
    they will hold in position without slipping up or down or twisting in the
    casing requires much time, as well as the 
    services of a person expert in such work. Featherbone, on the other hand,
    is not expensive; it is very pliable and may be sewed through readily and
    without injury, thus permitting it to be secured in place with very little
  effort.</p>
  <p> Many kinds and grades of featherbone, covered with silk, satin, or cotton,
    are to be had, and as boning is generally put in places subject to great
    wear and strain it is advisable, if the best results are desired, always
    to employ a good quality of featherbone. The cheaper grades frequently break
  before a garment is worn out, making it necessary to replace them.</p>
  <p> 39. In order that a good idea may be formed of the way in which featherbone
    may be applied, the boning of a tight lining and girdles are taken up in
    detail at this time. The various steps to be taken and precautions to be
    observed should not be passed over lightly, for a knowledge of such work
  is of particular value in the construction of many dresses and parts of dresses.</p>
  <h3> <a name="boned" id="boned"></a>BONED TIGHT LINING</h3>
  <p><a href="illust/16.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,355);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/16-t.jpg" alt="Figure 16" width="112" height="211" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>40. Selection of Material.&#8212;In Fig. 16 is shown a tight lining stayed
    and supported with featherbone. A lining so prepared is necessary for a waist
    the material of which must be supported to retain its shape, and also for
    a dress that is draped, for it serves as an excellent foundation on which
    to build. The kind of material to use for such a lining depends on the material
    employed for the dress of which the lining is to be a part. China silk, messaline,
    and percaline are used most, but taffeta silk is sometimes employed, and
    for inexpensive dresses cambric or light-weight sateen may be used if desired.
    For nearly all soft-silk dresses, however, China-silk lining will be found
    convenient and satisfactory, for it is not unduly expensive and it is light
    in weight and yet of a weave firm enough to give the necessary support to
    the dress itself. For dresses of wool or of heavy silk or satin, percaline
    of good quality is suitable for linings, unless more expensive lining is
  desired; then, of course, taffeta silk or firmly woven satin is preferable.</p>
  <p> 41. <strong>Amount of Material Required</strong>.&#8212;For the average
    figure, 2 yd. of 30-in. material is usually sufficient for the tight lining
    of a 
    dress, because in a dress lining the extension below the waist line is not
    so great as for a lining used as a dress-form covering; usually, it is from
    3 to 6 in., the length depending on the style of dress in which the lining
    is to be used. Sleeves are rarely made of the same material as the dress
    lining, for the reason that such material would make the sleeve appear clumsy,
    being too heavy to cling to the arm and to shape into it properly; yet, if
    the sleeves for any reason are to be lined with the same material as the
    dress, allowance must be made for the extra 
  material that will be required.</p>
  <p> 42. <strong>Cutting Out and Making the Dress Lining</strong>.&#8212;To
    cut out  and make a tight lining that is to be stayed with featherbone, as
    shown in
    Fig. 16, requires as much care as the tight-fitting lining used to cover
    a padded dress form, the procedure, briefly, being as follows: First, determine
    how far below the waist line the lining is to come, and then fold back or
    cut off the tight-lining pattern pieces at the proper places. Next, fold
    the material through the center, crosswise, and pin the selvage edges together,
    and on it place the pattern pieces, pinning them in place in the manner explained
    in connection with the dress-form covering. With the pattern pieces in place,
    cut the 
    lining out, allowing 3/8 to &frac12; in. for seams; also, cut two bias strips
    1 &frac12; in. wide and 2 in. longer than the opening of the lining. These strips
    serve
    as facings for the opening, as a casing for the featherbone, and as a covering
    for the rings of the hooks and eyes. After the material is cut out, baste
    and fit the lining and then stitch and press all seams except the shoulder
    seams. These seams should have the basting removed from them so that the
    lining will lie out smooth, thus making it more convenient to put in the
  featherbone.</p>
  <p> If sleeves are to be made of the same material as the lining, cut them
    the same as the sleeves for a dress-form tight lining; also, baste 
    and fit them, but do not fit them so close as for a dress-form sleeve, as
    they must be loose enough to be perfectly comfortable. When the sleeves are
    properly fitted, stitch them in the regular way, but do not attach them to
  the lining until it is boned.</p>
  <p> With the lining in this condition, the work of boning, or inserting the
  featherbone may be taken up.</p>
  <p> 43. <strong>Quantity of Featherbone Required</strong>.&#8212;The quantity
    of featherbone required for a tight lining is not great. On an average, the
    two-piece-back lining
    requires 2 &frac12; yd. and the three-piece-back lining, about 3 yd., the quantity
    depending on whether the figure is long-waisted or short-waisted. Long-waisted
    figures, as is evident, require more featherbone length for each seam than
  do short-waisted figures.</p>
  <p> 44. <strong>Cutting the Featherbone Into Proper Lengths</strong>.&#8212; The
     first step in preparing featherbone for a tight lining is to cut it into
    proper lengths. Therefore, measure the under-arm seam from the armhole to
    the waist line to determine its length and then cut a piece, or strip, of
    featherbone equal in length to one-half of the length thus determined, plus
    the length below the waist line, plus 1 in. This extra inch is an allowance
    for finishing the end of the featherbone that is to be uppermost when secured
    to the waist. The piece thus cut out serves as a measure in cutting the
    other bones to be used, for their length is regulated by the length of the
  under-arm seam.</p>
  <p> Next, cut a second under-arm piece of featherbone, making it the same length
    as the first piece; then, as the waist lining here discussed opens in the
    back, cut a piece for the center front and two for the center back, making
    each of these 1 in. longer than the featherbone cut for the under-arm seam.
    Of course, if the waist opens in front, two of these pieces would be for
    the center front and the other for the center back. For openings of this
    kind, there is a special hook-and-eye featherbone. It is woven a little closer
    than the covered bone and is a little softer, making it easier to sew through.
    However, if hook-and-eye featherbone cannot be procured, use may be made
  of regular featherbone.</p>
  <p> Next, cut two pieces of featherbone for the two front side seams, and two
    pieces for the two back side seams, making each 2 in. longer than the under-arm
    piece used as a measure. The two front side seams must be boned a trifle
    higher than the under-arm and the center-front seam in order to avoid a break
    at the bust line; and the 
    same remark holds true for the featherbones in the back side seams&#8212; they
    must come higher than the piece, or pieces, at the center back in order to
  avoid a break below the shoulder blades.</p>
  <p class="clear"><a href="illust/17.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,443);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/17-t.jpg" alt="Figure 17" width="141" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>45. <strong>Finishing the Ends of Featherbone</strong>.&#8212;After cutting
    the pieces of featherbone&#8212;nine in all&#8212;in the manner just explained,
    it is necessary to finish the ends of all except the two used for the opening
    of the waist.
    The covering and lining is pulled off both of these so as to avoid making
    the casing bulky when the featherbone is in place. As the hook-and-eye featherbone
    has no covering, this precaution, of course, does not have to be observed
    when it is used. 
    To finish the ends of the feather-bone, proceed as shown in Fig. 17. Pull
    down the covering and lining of the featherbone to within 1 in. of the upper
    end; cut the featherbone off with a pair of shears or scissors, shaping the
    end as at <em>a</em>; and cut away the lining portion until it appears as
    at <em>b</em>. Then
    turn the covering under 1/8 in. and bring it down 3/8 in. over the end, covering
    it entirely, as at <em>c</em>. Finally, overcast the edges as shown at <em>d</em>,
    so that the end will have a neat appearance. When all the pieces of feather-bone
    are finished in this manner, measure up from the waist line on each seam
    of the lining to the 
    point where each bone will come, and there place a pin crosswise so as to
  mark the point where the end of the bone is to be placed.</p>
  <p> 46. <strong>Boning With the Boning Attachment</strong>.&#8212;The next step in boning a lining
    consists in stitching the featherbone in place. Sewing silk should be used
    for this purpose, as it is a little more elastic than cotton thread and therefore
    is not so liable to break. Then, too, if silk-covered featherbone is used,
  as is generally the case, the silk thread is in keeping with it.</p>
  <p class="clear"> To<a href="illust/19.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,687);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/19-t.jpg" alt="Figure 19" width="200" height="180" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a> stitch<a href="illust/18.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,701);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/18-t.jpg" alt="Figure 18" width="200" height="176" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a> the featherbone in place, proceed as shown in Figs. 18 and 19.
    Lay the piece of featherbone on the sewing-machine feed so that its finished
    end is next to the presser foot and its wrong side 
    is up; pull the featherbone under the needle, and hold it so that its center
    is exactly under the needle point and the finished end of the bone is &frac12;
     in. beyond the needle; then, holding the feather-bone in this position,
    place
    the boning attachment over the feather-bone and secure it in position with
    the large thumbscrew that is a part of the equipment of every sewing machine.
    When the featherbone is in proper position, it should appear as shown in
    Fig. 18. Next, place a pressed-open seam of the lining directly over the
    center of the featherbone, as at <em>a</em>, Fig. 19, with the crosswise
    pin that marks the termination of the featherbone even with the finished
    end of the 
    bone, and proceed to stitch the seam to the featherbone, as shown, beginning
    &frac12; in. below the end of the bone. This &frac12; in. of the bone is left free
    so that it will not wear a hole in the lining nor draw at the upper end,
    as
    it might
    do if it were sewed in place. The attachment will guide the featherbone,
    making it necessary only to watch the seam so as to keep its stitching line
  directly over the center of the featherbone.</p>
  <p class="clear"><a href="illust/20.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,769);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/20-t.jpg" alt="Figure 20" width="200" height="160" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>47. In boning this lining, which opens in the back, it is well to begin
    with the center-front seam and then work around to the back, boning each
    seam,
    with the exception of the opening. Of course, if 
    the lining opens in front, the procedure would be the reverse of this. To
    get the best results in doing this work, crowd, or ease, each seam on to
    the featherbone&#8212;not so much, though, as to make a wrinkle, but just
    enough to keep the seams from appearing the least bit drawn, for there should
    be just a little more seam length in each seam than bone length. By easing
    all the seams to the featherbone pieces in this manner, the bones are not
    liable to pull, or pouch, out from the figure, for then the lining is a trifle
    fuller than the featherbones, and it has a tendency to hold them back close
    to the figure, whereas if the seams were stretched over the bones, the reverse
    would be true. 
    When, in each seam, a point within 1 in. of the waist line is reached, lift
    the featherbone by pulling the seam firm, as in Fig. 20, for 2 in.; that
    is, stretch the seam until there is more bone length than seam length for
    1 in. above and 1 in. below the waist line. This operation, called <strong>springing
    the bone</strong>, is performed so as to give the proper curvature to the figure.
    It is necessary in the hip section to crowd, or ease, the seams of the lining
    to the featherbone so that it will set smooth and not have a tendency to
    pouch out at the lower edge. When all the seams are boned in the manner explained,
  remove the attachment and proceed with the finishing of the opening.</p>
  <p class="clear"><a href="illust/21.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,411);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/21-t.jpg" alt="Figure 21" width="130" height="210" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>48. <strong>Preparing the Casing and the Facing for the Opening</strong>.
     The casing and the facing for the opening should be prepared next. Therefore,
    place the bias facing pieces with their right sides to the wrong side of
    the lining and one bias edge along the seam line of the opening, as at <em>a</em>,
    Fig. 21. Turn the seam allowance of the lining over the facing on the traced
    line, and then stitch 1/8 in. from the edge, as at <em>b</em>. Place the
    hook-and-eye featherbone or the uncovered featherbone, whichever is used,
    up as close
    as possible to the stitching between the lining and the facing, and stitch
    through the bone, the facing, and the lining, as at<em> c</em>, from the
    top of the bone, easing the lining on to the bone to within 1 in. of the
    waist line;
    then spring 
    the bone for 2 in.&#8212;that is, 1 in. above and 1 in. below the waist line&#8212;and
    ease the lining on to the bone to the bottom of the waist. Next, stitch on
    the outside of the bone, as at <em>d</em>, and continue this stitching from the
    neck of the lining to the bottom. This stitching strengthens the facing and
    provides a firm piece on which to sew the rings of the hooks and eyes. Finish
    both sides of the casing in the same manner, and then make ready for the
    hooks and eyes, which should be sewn on before the lining is finished at
  the top or the bottom.</p>
  <p> 49. <strong>Marking for the Hooks and Eyes</strong>.&#8212;Before marking
    the spaces for the hooks and eyes, determine how high the lining is to come
    at the neck
    and place a pin crosswise at this point, so that no 
    marking will be done on the portion that will be cut off, for, as a rule,
    a lace yoke is used in a dress requiring a boned lining, or the neck is cut
    low, and it is not necessary to extend the hooks and eyes on the lining portion
    all the way up to the neck. To mark for the hooks and eyes, bring the edges
    of the opening together, waist line meeting, and place pins crosswise every
    few inches to hold the. edges together; then, with one cross-slot of the
    Picken dressmaker's gauge directly over the waist line, as at <em>e</em>,
    Fig. 21, mark each cross-slot with a pencil 
    or with tailor's chalk. Move the gauge along on the lining until the entire
    length is marked, always remembering to place a cross-slot of the gauge directly
    over the last mark made, so as to insure even spacing the entire length of
  the opening.</p>
  <p class="clear"><a href="illust/22.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,366);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/22-t.jpg" alt="Figure 22" width="144" height="250" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>50. <strong>Alternating the Hooks and Eyes</strong>. &#8212; On referring
    to Fig. 22, it will be seen that the hooks and eyes of a tight lining whose
    opening edges
    meet
    are sewn on differently from those of a garment whose opening edges overlap,
    as, for example, in the shirred dress previously discussed. By alternating
    the hooks and eyes in the manner shown, a more substantial closing 
    is obtained and the danger of the hooks becoming unhooked is obviated. Thus,
    it is possible on a boned lining to use humpless hooks and round eyes, which
    are easier to hook and unhook than are hump hooks and straight eyes, especially
  on a garment that fits as close as a tight lining.</p>
  <p> In sewing hooks and eyes on the tight lining, place the prong of each hook
    in about 1/16 in. from the edge of the casing, as shown at <em>a</em>, and
    let the eye extend out 1/16 in., as at <em>b</em>, so that the hook may catch
    over the eye easily, remembering, in placing the hooks, to put a hook at
    the waist
    line on the right-hand side of the opening for convenience in hooking.
    Sew over the rings, through the bone and lining, with an over-and-over stitch,
    rather than with a buttonhole stitch. This kind of stitch requires much time
    to make, but it is very necessary, 
    because considerable strain comes on the hooks and eyes of a tight, boned
    lining. Also, remember to sew through the prong of each hook, so that there
    will be no possibility of the prongs pulling away from the casing. After
    sewing through the rings, in sewing on the round eyes, sew across the bottom
    of the eye, as at <em>c</em>. When all the hooks and eyes are sewed on, turn
    the outer edge of the facing over a scant 1/4 in., as at <em>d</em>, and
    hem the turned edge to
    the first stitching of the casing, as at <em>e</em>. Then, turn down and
    overhand the facing edge on the other side of the opening, taking care to
    have the
    facing come well up under the prongs of 
    the hooks, as at <em>f</em>. With this work completed, proceed to finish
  the lining itself.</p>
  <p> 51. <strong>Finishing the Lining</strong>.&#8212;To finish the lining,
    trim it off even all the way around the bottom, and then face it with a bias
    strip of the lining
    material cut 1 in. wide, turning the facing over and
    finishing it &frac12; in. wide on the wrong side. The finishing of the neck and
    the armhole will not be fully explained until the lining is used in the making
    up of a dress, as the dress itself determines the kind of finish to use for
    the neck and the armhole or the sleeves. However, if it is desired to complete
    the lining, the stock collar may be added to the neck, and the top of the
    collar and the armholes bound with bias facing finished 3/8 in. wide. If
    sleeves of the same material as the lining are to be used, stitch and notch
    the seams
    and sew them in the 
    lining, overcasting the armholes and facing the sleeves at the wrist, or
  lower edge, with a 3/8-in. finished facing.</p>
  <p class="clear"> 52. <strong>Boning a Lining Without an Attachment</strong>.&#8212; Feather-bone
    <a href="illust/24.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,604);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/24-t.jpg" alt="Figure 24" width="200" height="205" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>may <a href="illust/23.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,620);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/23-t.jpg" alt="Figure 23" width="200" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>be put in without the boning attachment previously mentioned, if necessary;
    but,
    in such an event, more time is required and much care must be exercised in
    guiding the featherbone and the seam at the same time. To bone a lining without
    the attachment, first finish the pieces of featherbone at one end and mark
    their position on the seams in the manner already explained; then, instead
    of using the attachment, open out the seam as in Fig. 23, place the 
    center of the featherbone, wrong side down, directly over the center of the
    seam, and begin to stitch &frac12; in. from the end of the bone; proceed with
    the stitching very carefully, easing the lining and springing 
    the featherbone where necessary. Fig. 23 illustrates clearly how to stretch
    the lining in order to spring the bone, and Fig. 24 shows how to ease the
  seam on to the featherbone without the attachment.</p>

  <p> 53. Dresses and gowns of sheer fabrics other than lingerie materials require
    some sort of foundation on which to build the garment, and where a full tight
    lining is not desirable a <strong>boned girdle</strong>&#8212;that is, a
    girdle, or belt, stayed with featherbone&#8212;is a very satisfactory foundation.
    Boned girdles, or <em>boned bodices</em>, as they are sometimes called, may be constructed
    of silk
    or satin and used in the very elaborate gowns, or they may be made of inexpensive
    material and made to serve to excellent advantage in the simplest dress or
     blouse. Very satisfactory girdle forms may be made of a good quality of
    percaline,
    as this material is firm, keeps its shape well, and stretches very little;
    in fact, percaline seems to be used more than any other material for this
  purpose.</p>
  <p> At any rate, the uses to which such a foundation may be put are so numerous
    that it is not considered necessary to enumerate them, for when a correctly
    fitted and correctly made girdle form is used in a dress, no argument will
    be required to convince even the most skeptical of its merits. The neat effect
    it gives a dress, to say nothing of the support it offers, makes it invaluable
  in draped or non-washable dresses.</p>
  <p> 54. The figure has much to do with the shape that the girdle, or foundation
    form, should assume; Dame Fashion, too, has a word to say as to its width
    and shaping. When figures are straight from bust to hips and the dresses
    assume the same lines, then straight girdle 
    forms should be used; if figures curve in at the waist line and the dresses
    fit close, the close-fitting girdle forms are desirable. A very slender woman
    frequently can add to her appearance by using a moderately straight girdle;
    and, on the other hand, the stout woman may be made to appear less stout
    if a girdle form that is only slightly curved is worn, for such a girdle
    brings the waist line into prominence and helps to lose the full bust and
    hips. Women large in stature or in flesh are frequently of the opinion that
    they must wear their clothes just as tight as possible, while in many instances
    the straighter lines would serve to make them appear less stout than if the
    garments fitted close. With these thoughts in mind, several styles of girdle
    forms are here considered, in order that one may be had for any style of
    figure. As will be observed, some of them open in the front and some open
    in the back. The location of the girdle opening depends on the style of dress
    for which it is to be used and, of course, the location of the opening in
  this dress.</p>
  <p class="clear"><a href="illust/25.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',314,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/25-t.jpg" alt="Figure 25" width="200" height="80" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>55. In Fig. 25 is shown a <strong>straight girdle form</strong>. This style
    of girdle is excellent for use in light-weight dresses that do not fit close
    at the waist
    line and
    yet need some support where the waist and the skirt join. To make a girdle
    of this kind, cut a crosswise piece of material the width of the girdle desired,
    as a rule from 2 to 3 &frac12; in. Ordinarily, a lengthwise strip of material
    would be cut for a girdle, but as material cut crosswise fits into a figure
    better,
    and as the stitches used in staying the dress to the girdle impart strength
    to it, all possibility of splitting is overcome. Then, as shown at <em>a</em>,
    sew a piece of <em>ribbon-covered collar bone</em>, which is another form
    of featherbone used for support in collars, crosswise of the girdle every
    2 or 3 in. to
    give it the necessary support. When these pieces are in place, bind the outer
    edge with bias binding tape, as shown. After the edges are thus bound, put
    the girdle form around the figure and 
    pin it as tight as desired; then cut off the ends &frac12; in. from the pins,
    allowing this &frac12; in. to finish the ends with a narrow hem. When the ends
    are stitched,
    sew hooks and eyes on the girdle opening&#8212;one hook in the center on
    the right-hand side and one at each edge of the girdle. If the girdle is
    more than 3 in. wide, then two additional hooks will be needed to insure
  a substantial closing.</p>
  <p class="clear"><a href="illust/26.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',394,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/26-t.jpg" alt="Figure 26" width="200" height="100" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>56. In Fig. 26 is illustrated a straight girdle that is a little wider
    than the one shown in Fig. 25. It is made in practically the same way, but,
    as
    will be observed, the pieces of featherbone are placed farther apart. Placing
    the featherbone in a girdle is important work; yet, straight girdles do not
  demand so much attention as fitted girdles.</p>
  <p class="clear"> <a href="illust/27.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',543,750);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/27-t.jpg" alt="Figure 27" width="200" height="143" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>57. In long-waisted dresses the girdles, or belts, of which come below
    the natural waist line, girdle forms similar to the one shown 
    in Fig. 27, and known as a <strong>fitted girdle</strong>, should be used.
    For a girdle of this kind, the top of the circular-skirt pattern serves as
    a pattern. The
    waist line is divided into four equal parts, and the 
    extension is made 4 in. below the waist line and 1 in. above, the work being
    carried out in practically the same way as for a skirt with a raised waist
  line.</p>
  <p> In cutting out the material for a fitted girdle, place the pattern pieces
    traced from the foundation circular-skirt draft in the 
    same way as they would be placed in preparing to cut out a skirt; that is,
    with the center of each gore as near as possible on a lengthwise thread of
    the material. Cut the girdle so that there will be a seam in both the center
    front and the center back, and trace the waist line on each section. With
    this work done, baste the sections together, beginning at the waist line
    and basting up and down, which method of basting applies for all fitted girdles.
    Next, put the girdle on and fit it, remembering that the extension should
    come at least 1 in. 
    above the waist line; also, pin a tape around the waist line in the regular
    way, pinning it rather close. Fit the top of the girdle form in the same
    way as the top of a skirt, being careful to have it set smooth and easy all
    the way around, taking in or letting out the seams if necessary. When the
     tape is securely pinned in place, remove the girdle; stitch up the seams
    and 
    trim them to within 1/8 in. of the stitching; press the seams open and
    stitch the waist tape on, taking care to keep it straight and even and to
    stitch on both edges; then proceed to put in the pieces of 
    featherbone <em>without</em> the boning attachment. As the seams in this girdle are
    trimmed very close and the featherbone is stitched on each edge instead of
    the center, the pieces of featherbone may be attached better without the
  attachment.</p>
  <p class="clear"> <a href="illust/28.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,696);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/28-t.jpg" alt="Figure 28" width="200" height="178" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>In Fig. 28 is shown how <em>five-cord tape</em> may be used in a girdle
    of this kind. Such featherbone is stitched directly over the seam, and this
    is covered
    with a strip of bias tape that is wide enough to cover the featherbone. Five-cord
    tape does not make the girdle quite so heavy as silk-covered featherbone
    does; however, if a light-weight girdle is desired, the covering may be removed
    from each side of the silk-covered featherbone, the bone stitched to the
    seam in the way just described, and the seam and bone then covered with bias
    tape. If desired, <em>three-cord tape</em>, which is a trifle narrower than
    the five-cord  kind, may be used instead of either the regular featherbone
    or the five-cord
    tape; but if it is used the seams of the girdle should come a little closer
    together, as the three-cord tape does not give so much support as either
  of the other staying materials.</p>
  <p> When the featherbone is in place, finish the opening 
    of the girdle the same as for a boned tight lining; also, place the feather-bones
    in the casing and sew on hooks and eyes in the same manner, beginning at
    the waist line to mark for the hooks and eyes. When the hooks and eyes are
    sewed on, trim the girdle even at the top and the bottom and bind it with
    a strip of bias tape, taking care to cover the ends of the featherbone at
  each seam well, so that they will not pull out.</p>
  <p class="clear"> <a href="illust/29.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',602,798);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/29-t.jpg" alt="Figure 29" width="200" height="150" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>58. In Fig. 29 is shown a girdle that is very similar in appearance to
    the one illustrated in Fig. 26. It serves practically the same purpose, but
    it
    is shaped so as to fit a little and therefore has a tendency to make a figure
    appear a trifle smaller below the waist line. This girdle is cut from the
    pattern of a two-piece-back waist, and extends 2 in. below the waist line
    and 3 in above. So as not to destroy the original tight-lining pattern, make
  a pattern for this girdle by tracing off the sections.</p>
  <p> The girdle shown in Fig. 29 is basted and fitted in the same way as the
    one shown in Fig. 27, and the seams are stitched up and the tape is basted
    on
    in the same manner; but the featherbones are not put 
    in in the same way. In a girdle form of this kind, it is necessary to stretch
    the seam,  as for a tight lining, for 2 in. at the waist line and then ease
    the lining to the featherbone below the waist line. The opening, though,
    is finished in exactly the same manner; that is, the same as for a boned
  tight lining.</p>
  <p class="clear"> <a href="illust/30.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',556,726);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/30-t.jpg" alt="Figure 30" width="200" height="152" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>59. In Fig. 30 is illustrated a girdle with a 3-in. extension above the
    waist line and only a 1-in. extension below. This style of girdle form is
    used
    where the girdle of a dress is built a little higher than the normal waist
    line. The two-piece-back waist pattern is used in making the pattern for
    this girdle form, the necessary extensions being made above and below the
    waist line so as to give the girdle the desired width. The girdle is made
  in practically the same way as the one shown in Fig. 29.</p>
  <p class="clear"> <a href="illust/31.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,662);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/31-t.jpg" alt="Figure 31" width="214" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>60. In Fig. 31 is shown a form that is a little too wide to be 
    properly termed a girdle form, yet in nearly every instance in connection
    with dressmaking it would be designated by that name. It is really a <em>bodice
    stay</em>, as it comes well up on the figure, the extensions being 4 in.
    below the waist line and 4 &frac12; in. above. Such a bodice stay is excellent
    where a
    very wide girdle is worn, as it tends to add strength to the waist; in fact,
    it gives almost 
    the same support as a tight lining. In some instances where only drapery
    shows over the shoulders, as in evening dresses, the girdle form, or bodice,
    is cut wide enough to come well up under the arms. 
    The only difference between the making of such a girdle as this and one of
    the others already mentioned lies in the alternating of the hooks and eyes
    on the opening. In a girdle as wide as this, it is better to alternate the
    hooks and eyes than to put all the hooks on one side and all the eyes on
  the other.</p>
  <p> 61. Where a bodice stay is made so very high above the waist line, straps
    of ribbon or tape &frac12; to 1 in. wide may be used over the shoulders, in order
    to hold the upper edge in position. A good plan is to make a close-fitting
    bodice stay of China silk of good quality, and then bind its upper and lower
    edges with ribbon and provide ribbon straps for over the shoulders. Such
    a stay affords a substantial foundation for lingerie dresses and is invaluable
  as a support under dainty silk or lace corset covers.</p>
  <p> When made for the purpose just mentioned, a bodice stay is best opened
    at the center front; but when made to serve as a foundation for dresses the
  opening must be made at a seam that is convenient for the dress opening.</p>
  <p> 62. When the straight-line silhouette is in vogue, ready-to-wear dresses
    carry a loose waist-line effect and in nearly all medium-priced dresses girdle
    forms are omitted and a piece of skirt belting, the soft pliable quality
    being always preferable, is used at the waist line. The waist is fastened
    to the belt first and then the skirt is fastened, neither meeting, however.
    This precaution is taken to avoid bulk around the waist. In most of the better
    dresses, a strip of China silk edged all the way around with narrow, inexpensive
    lace is used on the inside to cover the belt and to make the dress appear
  well finished.</p>
  <p> In dresses having the long-waist, loose-basque effect, a fitted lining
    of soft, firmly woven silk or satin is used, the lower edge of the lining
    coming
    from 2 &frac12; to 4 in. below the waist line. If the dress is of heavy material
    and the skirt is draped at the waist line, it is advisable to use a ribbon
    or a tape 1 1/4 or 1 &frac12; in. wide inside the lining to hold the waist line
    in place. This ribbon should merely be catch-stitched to the side seams,
    center
    back,
  or center front, and then the ends hooked together independent of the lining.</p>
  <p> When the waist-line effect is loose, boning is omitted even when a fitted
    lining is used, unless a very low, loose corset is worn. Some women who wear
    girdle corsets prefer to use a few bones in the waist lining as a corset
  substitute.</p>
  <p> A great responsibility in point of style rests with the waist line of a
    dress. A smart dress from a fashion point of view can lose its smartness
    entirely
    by a waist line that is too tight or too high for the silhouette. Very careful
    consideration should always be given in fitting a waist line to have it individually
    becoming and at the same time entirely in keeping with the mode. In fitting
    waist lines, it is always well to remember that the hem, the neck, and the
    sleeve turns should be made before the waist-line effect has been definitely
    decided, because the waist line is influenced by all, especially the neck
  and the hem.</p>

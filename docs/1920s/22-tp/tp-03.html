<h2>Tailors' Cushions and Press Boards</h2>
  <p> <a href="illust/49.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',340,669);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/49-t.jpg" alt="Figure 49" width="220" height="105" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>53. For successful tailoring, it is absolutely essential to have proper devices on hand for pressing, For the pressing of curved seams, such as the bust seams of coats, the hip seams of coats and  skirts, and shoulder seams, there is perhaps no better device than what is commonly known by tailors as a <strong>ham cushion</strong>; in fact, no custom-tailoring establishment is complete without one. Such a cushion, which is  illustrated in Fig. 49, consists simply of a covering of white <em>tailors' felt</em>    that is carefully stuffed with rags. Ham cushions can be purchased in tailors' supply houses, but a cushion that will prove to be just as serviceable and much less expensive can be made in the home.</p>
  <p class="clear"> 54. For a ham cushion there should be purchased at a tailors' supply house 5/8 yd. of 36-in. white tailors' felt. Such felt is very durable, and while it is firm it is not so compact as the felt used for upholstery or for shoes and hats. The quantity of felt mentioned is sufficient for a ham cushion, as it may be cut on the true bias and the correct length obtained in this way. The small pieces of felt that remain after cutting out the covering need not be wasted, either, for they can be used for making a cushion that is just one-fourth as large. A small ham cushion is very useful, as it can be used inside of sleeves,  under the armhole seam, and in many places where the large one might be too large or too unhandy. In addition to the felt for either cushion, there should be procured sufficient heavy muslin or galatea for an interlining, and enough clean, old woolen rags for stuffing. Rags from old woolen skirts, coats, or blankets are satisfactory, provided all hard parts are omitted.</p>
  <p> <a href="illust/50.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',335,794);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/50-t.jpg" alt="Figure 50" width="220" height="99" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>55. In order to cut out the covering and the interlining for a ham cushion, it is necessary to have a pattern. Such a pattern may be drafted in the manner shown in Fig. 50, the procedure being as follows: Fold lengthwise through the center a piece of paper that is 14 in. wide and 21 in. long, and, then, with the folded edge next to you, proceed to locate the necessary points for outlining the pattern. Locate point <em>A</em> 1 in. from the right edge of the paper; point <em>B</em> 19 in. to the left of <em>A</em> on the fold; point <em>C</em> 6 in. directly above <em>B</em>; and point <em>D</em> 6 in. directly above <em>A</em>. Then connect <em>A</em> and <em>D</em>, as well as <em>B</em> and <em>C</em>, with a vertical line, and complete the parallelogram by connecting <em>C</em> and <em>D</em> with a horizontal line. With the parallelogram thus drawn, locate points to be used in drawing the pattern lines. Thus, locate point <em>B2</em> 1 &frac12; in. above <em>B</em> on line <em>BC</em>; point <em>A2</em> 1 in. above <em>A</em> on line <em>A D</em>; point <em>E</em> midway between <em>C</em> and <em>D</em>; and point <em>E2</em> 2 in. to the left of <em>E</em>. Then connect <em>B2</em> and <em>E2</em>, as well as <em>E</em> and <em>A2</em>, with a well-curved line, as shown in the illustration, being careful to avoid forming points at <em>B2</em>, <em>E2</em>, <em>E</em>, and <em>A2</em>. When the draft is thus made, form the pattern, which when cut out, should be egg-shaped, by cutting, through both thickness of paper, from <em>B</em>, through <em>B2</em>, to <em>E2</em>, and from <em>E2</em>, through <em>E</em> and <em>A2</em>, to <em>A</em>.</p>
  <p class="clear"> 56. When the pattern is cut out, place it on a double thickness of the felt and cut out the cushion covering. Do not allow for seams, as the edges of the felt must be whipped together, as shown in Fig. 49. Also cut out the interlining, using the same pattern, but allowing 3/8-in. seams on all edges. With the material cut out, seam the interlining together, and then prepare the filling. To do this, tear and cut old woolen rags into small pieces that are free from hard seams, and then dampen these bits of material so that they will pack very tight. Then proceed to stuff the  interlining. Care in packing is very necessary, as the rags must be filled in even and close, so that the outside will be smooth and firm. After making sure that the interlining is stuffed as full as possible and will keep its shape, close the opening of the interlining with diagonal basting and then overhand it closely. With the interlining thus prepared, place the felt over it, and, then, drawing the edges together, overhand them closely, keeping the surface absolutely smooth and as tight as possible.</p>
  <p class="clear"> <a href="illust/51.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',280,656);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/51-t.jpg" alt="Figure 51" width="220" height="90" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>57. When it is desired to press seams very flat and hard or so well that they will scarcely be visible, it is well to use a <strong>tailors' press block</strong>, one style of which is shown in Fig. 51. Such a block consists of a 2-in. piece of oak that measures 18 in. on the straight side and 14 in. across, and is covered with two thicknesses of tailors' felt stitched just as tight as possible and tacked  in place on the block, as shown.</p>
  <p class="clear"> <a href="illust/52.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',377,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/52-t.jpg" alt="Figure 52" width="220" height="98" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>58. Another device used in pressing tailored work is the <strong>tailors' press stand</strong>  shown in Fig. 52. Such a stand may be made to take the place of a ham cushion, and in addition it has a sleeve board attached, as at <em>a</em>. A tailors' press stand is usually 28 in. long, 7 in. high, and 10 in. wide. It is, however, much more difficult and expensive to make than a ham cushion, and, besides, on account of its weight, it is much more difficult to handle.</p>

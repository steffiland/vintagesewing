<h2>  CHAPTER IV &#8212;CROWNS</h2>
<h3><a name="i" id="i"></a>I. FRAME FOUNDATIONS USED FOR CROWNS </h3>
    <h4><a name="ip" id="ip"></a>PRESSED CROWNS</h4>
    <p>A pressed crown is
        the simplest foundation to use for a crown because it may be purchased
        ready for use. When a soft crown is desired, the top of
      the crown may be cut out with a razor blade after the hat is completed
    but before the hat is lined.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="i1" id="i1"></a>1. Desirable kinds of pressed crowns</strong>. A soft
        pressed crown (one made of elastic net, crinoline, or very lightweight
        jockey buckram) is always the most satisfactory,
      both from the point of view of comfort and of appearance.</p>
    <p><em>Plain oval</em>. A
    plain oval crown is the best foundation for most cap and section crowns.</p>
    <p><em>Cuff
        crowns</em>. An oval pressed crown with plain or draped separate cuff around
      the side crown may be used for mounting a cap crown (see <a href="#ii">section
      II</a>, of
      this chapter), and for mounting a fitted cap with a draped side (see <a href="#ii">section
      II</a>,
    of this chapter).</p>
    <p><em>Shaped oval crowns</em>. Shaped oval crowns&#8212;for example, one
      that is larger at the top and higher on the left side&#8212;often make
      good frames (or molds) over which to sew braid crowns. (See <a href="m-08.html#ii">Chapter
      VIII, section II</a>.)</p>
    <h4><strong><a href="illust/021.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',548,613);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/021-t.jpg" alt="Figure 21" width="180" height="156" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong><a name="isc" id="isc"></a>SIDE
      CROWN FOUNDATIONS</h4>
    <p>A bias strip of elastic net or willow may be cut to
        fit the brim headsize; the width of this band varies from 2 to 4 inches
      according to the kind of crown. Start with 4 inches and cut it lower if
      desired.
      Stretch the bias frame material so that the headsize is larger around than
    the top of the band. After it is shaped trim the headsize edge and wire and
    bind it. Cut the top edge so that it slants down in a lower curve on the
    right side. Bind it as for a frame edge.</p>
    <h6><strong>Figure 21. Pressed Crown with Cuff Side Crown.</strong></h6>
    <h3 class="clear"><a name="ii" id="ii"></a>II. KINDS OF CROWNS </h3>
    <h4><a name="iicc" id="iicc"></a>CAP CROWNS</h4>
    <p>A cap crown is a soft crown made with an
    oval or round top and a bias side.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="iicc1" id="iicc1"></a>1. Plain oval-top crowns.</strong> The most commonly
        used cap crown has an oval top and a bias side which measures from 5
      to 8 inches. The variation of width
      depends on the amount of drape desired in the side crown.</p>
    <p>The oval top may
    be used in two ways.</p>
    <p><em>Long from front to back. </em>The plain oval-top crown
        may be placed so that it is long from front to back, with the folds draped
        a little deeper on the
      right side.</p>
    <p><em>Wide from side to side.</em> The plain oval-top crown may be used
        so that its length is from side to side. The folds of the drape are then
      deeper at the sides, because the oval brings the side crown down lower
      at the sides, so that the crown stands higher in front and back than at
      the sides. The cap may be pushed back on the pressed crown so that the
      front is much higher than the back. This draping of a cap
    crown is becoming to a woman with a wide face oval (see <a href="#iii">section
    III</a> of this
    chapter).</p>
    <p><strong><a href="illust/022.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,622);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/022-t.jpg" alt="Figure 22" width="180" height="180" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a><a name="iicc2" id="iicc2"></a>2. Small oval-side crown shirred on cord. </strong>This is often used on
      a hat for a girl who has a small face. The top crown is so small that it
      is not much more than a tip. It varies in size from an oval of 4&frac12; by
      3
      inches to an oval of 3 by 2&frac14; inches.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="iicc3" id="iicc3"></a>3. Round top crown.</strong> Occasionally
        a round top, a perfect circle, is used for a cap crown, usually in a
    semidraped soft hat.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="iicc4" id="iicc4"></a>4. Method of mounting.</strong> Since a cap crown should always
        be soft in appearance it is usually mounted on a soft pressed crown or
        a bias side band of elastic
      net.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="iicc5" id="iicc5"></a>5. Seam placement. </strong>The seam in the side of a cap crown should always
    be placed where it shows least.</p>
    <p>In an even drape place the bias seam so
        that it starts at the center back and runs toward the right side. It
      will be less conspicuous on the right
      side. The hat is worn tilted down on the right side. Any trimming is usually
      on the right side.</p>
    <p>In an uneven drape the seam should always be placed where
      the side crown is lowest and the seam shows least.</p>
    <p>When there is a side-crown
        trimming, the seam of the bias side may be placed so that the trimming
        covers it.</p>
    <h4><a name="iips" id="iips"></a>PLAIN SECTIONAL</h4>
    <p>Plain sectional crowns are semifitted soft crowns made
    of a number of pie- or wedge-shaped sections.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="iips1" id="iips1"></a>1. Kinds of sectional crowns.</strong>      The various kinds of sectional crowns are: two-section crowns, four-section
        crowns, six-section crowns, eight-section
      crowns.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="iips2" id="iips2"></a>2. Method of assembling sectional crowns.</strong> (Exact directions are
    always given on each section-crown pattern.)</p>
    <p><em>Plain sectional crowns.</em> The
        method is always to baste from the center top down to the headsize before
        stitching. If the material used is very soft
      or very lightweight, an interlining is used. Care is needed to keep the
      seam smooth but not stretched.</p>
    <p><em><strong><a href="illust/023.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',453,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/023-t.jpg" alt="Figure 23" width="220" height="113" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>Corded sectional crown</em>&#8212;an unfinished
    bias cord is used to outline the sections (see Figure 23).</p>
    <h6><strong>Figure 23. An Unfinished Cord.</strong></h6>
    <p class="clear">For an even number
    of sections&#8212;there are two methods of cording (see<strong><a href="illust/025.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,770);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/025-t.jpg" alt="Figure 25" width="200" height="147" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>    figures<strong><a href="illust/024.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,679);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/024-t.jpg" alt="Figure 24" width="180" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong> 24 and 25).</p>
    <h6><strong><a name="fig24" id="fig24"></a>Figure 24. Cording a Sectional Crown.</strong></h6>
    <h6><strong>Figure 25. Making One Straight Cord from Front to Back in a Six-Sectional
        Crown.</strong></h6>
    <p>Cording half the sections is a method used when only half
      the sections are outlined with cord from the headsize to the center and
    down to the headsize again.</p>
    <p>They are then assembled with a plain section
        alternating with a corded one. This makes one cord on each seam and each
        cord pointed in a V at the center
      top crown.</p>
    <p>Making a straight cord from front to back&#8212;in this method
      one length of cord is run from front to back of the crown. One section
      is sewn on each side of this cord with the central points meeting. Any
      extra
      sections are then outlined with cord (from headsize to center and
    from the top to the headsize) and set in.</p>
    <p>In case of a four-section crown
      only one extra cord on each side is set in from headsize to center top.</p>
    <p>For
        an uneven number of sections, the best method is to outline one side
      of each section with cord and let all cord ends meet at the center top.
      The ends are hidden on the seam side. It will be seen that a fine soft
      cord is essential.</p>
    <h4><a name="iidr" id="iidr"></a>SECTIONAL CAP CROWN WITH DRAPED SIDE  CROWN</h4>
    <p>The top of the crown is made
      of pie-shaped sections which form a circle or an oval.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="iidr1" id="iidr1"></a>1. Assembling.</strong> In
        this type of crown the top crown is assembled with or without cords as
    for a plain sectional crown.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="iidr2" id="iidr2"></a>2. Mounting the top crown. </strong>The circle edge
        of the section cap thus formed is shirred and the cap is mounted on a
      pressed crown, the fullness evenly
      distributed, and the cap sewn to the pressed crown.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="iidr3" id="iidr3"></a>3. Draping the side
        crown. </strong>The side crown is a bias strip fitted loosely and joined in a
      seam. </p>
    <p><em>Seam placement. </em>The seam is placed as for a cap crown (see <a href="#iicc5">section
      II, 5</a>, of this chapter).</p>
    <p><em>Draping.</em> The side crown is draped in folds around
        the head-size. The width varies from 4 to 6 inches according to the fullness
        desired.</p>
    <p><em>Finish.</em> Top Edge. The top edge may be finished in two ways: </p>
    <p><em>a</em>. Fold finish.
    The edge may be turned in a fold and the fold slip-stitched to the cap.</p>
    <p><em>b.</em>      Wire finish. The top edge may be turned over a wire, or corded and finished
      as for a flange edge (see <a href="m-07.html#iifh">Chapter VII, section II</a>, under Fitted Hats).</p>
    <p>Lower
        or Headsize Edge. The lower or headsize edge may be finished in any one
      of three ways:</p>
    <p><em>a.</em> Inside-the-crown finish. The edge may be turned up inside
    the crown and whip-stitched to the frame. This gives a fold finish.</p>
    <p><em>b.</em>      Brim-fold finish. The headsize edge of the pressed crown may be sewn
      to the finished brim of the hat and the lower head-size edge of the side-crown
      drape pulled down over the crown headsize and slip-stitched to the brim.      </p>
    <p><em>c</em>. Crown-wire finish. The headsize edge of the pressed crown may be bound
        with hat material and the bias side-crown drape . may be worked over
      a wire and finished in the same way as the top edge is finished (see <a href="#ii">section
      II</a> of this chapter).</p>
    <p><a name="iitc" id="iitc"></a>TAM CROWNS</p>
    <p>Tam crowns are larger than other crowns and are always soft
        and loose. The drape should be adjusted after the hat is complete so
      that the lines are
      becoming to the type of individual.</p>
    <p>They are all cut by patterns where seam
      placement and mounting directions are given.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="iitc1" id="iitc1"></a>1. Fitted</strong> or <strong>circular crowns</strong>      are crowns with round or oval tops and a side crown which is cut from
    a segment of a large circle edge.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="iitc2" id="iitc2"></a>2. Sectional tams</strong> are larger but are
        treated much the same as plain sectional crowns. The shapes are different
        in outline because the extra flare is fitted
      into the same headsize as any other crown. The assembling of the sections
      is just the same (see <a href="#ii">section II</a> of this chapter). See <a href="m-07.html#fig33">Figure
      33</a>.</p>
    <p><em>Six-section. </em></p>
    <p><em>Four-section. </em></p>
    <p><em>Eight-section.</em></p>
    <p><em> Five-section.</em></p>
    <p><strong><a name="iitc3" id="iitc3"></a>3. Saddle tams.</strong>      Saddle tams are shaped with a long
      fitted strip running from side to side and with circular-shaped sections
      at front and back. See
      <a href="m-07.html#fig35">Figure 35</a>.</p>
    <p>Directions for assembling are always given in the patterns.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="iitc4" id="iitc4"></a>4. Round tam
        with bias side.</strong> In making this kind of tam the bias is held
        a little full to give extra flare, but never enough to make shirrings
        at
      the top-crown seam.</p>
    <h4><a name="iifc" id="iifc"></a>FITTED CROWNS</h4>
    <p>Fitted crowns differ from other kinds in that the different
    pieces are fitted and sewn separately to the pressed crown.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="iifc1" id="iifc1"></a>1. Fitted or
        pressed crowns.</strong> A top piece is fitted and sewn or pasted onto the top
      of a pressed crown, and a plain bias side crown fitted and finished
    with a fold or a wire finish (see section II of this chapter).</p>
    <p><strong><a name="iifc2" id="iifc2"></a>2. Draped
        side crown.</strong> This variety is the same as 1, but has a wider bias side.
      The extra width is draped in folds around the side crown. Many of the
      pressed crowns now on the market have plain or folded cuff sides over which
      the draped side crown may be folded.</p>
    <p>Place the bias side-crown seam where
        it will show least.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="iifc3" id="iifc3"></a>3. Fitted top crowns.</strong> Fitted top crowns may have a bias side crown which
    is corded in groups of three or more or which is corded at regular spaces.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="iifc4" id="iifc4"></a>4.
      Sectional crowns fitted on pressed crowns.</strong> A sectional crown (see <a href="#ii">section
      II</a> of this lesson) may be assembled and fitted over a pressed
      crown. </p>
    <h4><a name="iisoft" id="iisoft"></a>SOFT SEMIFITTED CROWNS</h4>
    <p><strong><a name="iisoft1" id="iisoft1"></a>1. Draped. </strong>Under this heading come the crowns that
        are draped with the extra fullness cut out. Folds are laid to match on
        the cut edges and an unfinished
    cord set in.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="iisoft2" id="iisoft2"></a>2. Sectional.</strong> A bias piece is fitted around a pressed crown.
        The lower edge is finished plain or draped in a fold. The top edge is
      cut in pie with a
      section pattern and the seams stitched plain or corded.</p>

    <h3><a name="iv" id="iv"></a>IV. HOW TO DETERMINE
    KINDS OF CROWNS SUITABLE TO INDIVIDUAL TYPES OF FACES</h3>
    <h4><a name="ivwhat" id="ivwhat"></a>WHAT DECIDES THE
    KIND OF CROWN TO BE WORN </h4>
    <p>The contour of the face&#8212;the
    proportion of the face oval&#8212;always determines the kind of crown suitable
    to the individual. The crown of the hat makes the complemental (top half)
    of the oval.</p>
    <h4><a name="ivr" id="ivr"></a>RULES FOR CHOOSING CROWNS</h4>
    <p><strong><a name="ivr1" id="ivr1"></a>1. For the wide face oval. </strong>The crown must never
        be narrower than the face at its widest point. A narrower crown makes
      a wide face seem wider in proportion.</p>
    <p>Wide, soft crowns are most becoming
        to wide faces. Four-section tams, round tams, saddle crowns, or cap
    crowns wide from side to side are good types.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="ivr2" id="ivr2"></a>2. For the narrower face.</strong>      The fitted crown must never be wider than the face oval at its widest
      point. A crown too wide overshadows a narrow face until
    the face seems even smaller.</p>
    <p>A soft drape may be used without spoiling the
    proportion. </p>
    <p>A soft, not too-wide crown is best for a narrow face, as
        cap crowns and soft six- and eight-section
      crowns.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="ivr3" id="ivr3"></a>3. For the long, thin face.</strong> The long, thin face must have a comparatively
      low, not too wide, crown. A very high or stiff crown must never be chosen.
      It adds and exaggerates length.</p>
    <p>A very flat crown is out of proportion and
    makes for exaggeration.</p>
    <p>Soft crowns of medium height and width complement
        the long, thin face. Soft cap crowns, long from front to back, section
        cap crowns, and circle cap crowns
    are very good for this type.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="ivr4" id="ivr4"></a>4. For the short face oval.</strong> The short face oval
        must avoid extremely high crowns and extremely wide crowns. A very high
        crown makes the face seem shorter
      by contrast. A very wide crown looks heavy and adds to the apparent width
      of the face.</p>
    <p>Medium-high crowns with soft, irregular width are best for
        this class, as soft crowns wide from side to side and two-section crowns.</p>
    <h4><a name="q" id="q"></a>QUESTIONS</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Define a cap crown, a section crown, a tam crown, a sectional
          cap crown.</li>
      <li> What is the important point in seam placement?</li>
      <li> Give two ways of assembling
        a corded sectional crown which has an even number of sections.</li>
      <li>What principle decides the kind of crown to be worn by any individual?</li>
      <li> Name the kinds of crowns
        becoming
        to four
        distinct types of individuals.</li>
      <li> Make five
        different kinds of crowns, doll-size. </li>
      <li> Give two kinds of crowns
        that may be used with each of five distinct types of hats as given in
        the Outline,
        section IV.</li>

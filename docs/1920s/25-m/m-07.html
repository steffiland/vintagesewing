<h2>    CHAPTER VII&#8212;THE FABRIC HAT</h2>
<h3>    <a name="i" id="i"></a>I. FALL MATERIALS AND FABRICS</h3>
<h4>    <a name="ivel" id="ivel"></a>VELVET <span class="small">(*See <a href="m-05.html#if1">Chapter
V, section I</a>.)</span></h4>
<p>    Velvet has more gorgeous color effects than any other fabric because of its
    deep silk pile which gives depth of light and shadow. The shadows cause one
    color to have many different tints.</p>
<h4>    <a name="isat" id="isat"></a>SATIN SOLEIL</h4>
<p>    Satin soleil in black is one of the smartest materials for tailored hats.</p>
   <p> As it comes, too, in all the velvet shades, velvet and soleil in matching
    shades make a handsome hat because of the contrast of the high lustre of
    soleil and the soft, dull finish of velvet.</p>
<h4>    <a name="iplu" id="iplu"></a>PLUSHES</h4>
<p>    <strong><a name="i1" id="i1"></a>1. Hatter's plush.</strong> Hatter's plush is similar in finish to soleil but has
    a much longer nap. It is used for strictly tailored hats and is usually shown
    in street shades.</p>
<p>    <strong><a name="i2" id="i2"></a>2. French plush.</strong> French plush is similar in finish to a fine coat plush.
    Though the pile is thick and deep and soft, the material is very lightweight.
    It is used in combination with satin, satin soleil, or velvet for tailored
    hats in street shades.</p>
<h4>    <a name="isatin" id="isatin"></a>SATIN</h4>
<p>    Satin is a favored fabric for late fall and early spring hats.</p>
<p>    <strong><a name="isatin1" id="isatin1"></a>1. Baronet satin. </strong>Baronet is a fiber satin with a high, almost metallic finish
    which combines beautifully with plush and with polished straws. Because of
    its lustre it makes a good background for beadwork and embroidery. Many smart
    hats for mid-season wear are made of baronet satin.</p>
   <p> <strong><a name="isatin2" id="isatin2"></a>2. Brocaded satin.</strong> Brocaded satin in black, white, and colors with silver
    and gold thread woven in is used for small winter hats. Harem and semidraped
    turbans of this fabric are very good to wear with furs and fur coats.</p>
<p>    <strong><a name="isatin3" id="isatin3"></a>3. Duchess satin. </strong>Duchess satin in street shades is used for draped and tailored
    hats and in combination with velvet, soleil, and straw for fall and early
    winter hats.</p>
<h4>    <a name="iduv" id="iduv"></a>DUVETYN</h4>
<p>    Duvetyn is one of the most satisfactory fabrics for fall sport and tailored
    hats. Its soft texture makes it effective for drapes in tailored hats. The
    dull finish and beautiful shades make good background for yarn and chenille
    embroidery.</p>
<h4>    <a name="ifm" id="ifm"></a>FANCY MATERIALS</h4>
<p>    <strong><a name="ifm1" id="ifm1"></a>1. Brocades. </strong>Brocades in gold, silver, tinsel, satin mixtures, velvet, chiffons,
    and georgettes are very handsome. These are used largely for formal afternoon
    and evening hats.</p>
<p>    Draped and semidraped hats combine brocades with plain velvets, satins, and
    furs. Ordinarily these hats are small or medium in size.</p>
<p>    <strong><a name="ifm2" id="ifm2"></a>2. Tapestries.</strong> Imported Chinese, Swiss, and French tapestries are beautiful
    in coloring and very lightweight. These, too, are combined with plain velvets
    and satins in harmonizing colors. They are used in designs for semidress,
    dressy afternoon, and evening hats.</p>
<p>    <strong><a name="ifm3" id="ifm3"></a>3. Chinese embroideries </strong>from Mandarin robes and <strong>embroidery
    medallions</strong> are used on satin pokes and Napoleons, on velvet-brim hats,
    on maline and velvet combinations, and occasionally to form entire turbans.
    The colors and work make very rich and effective models.</p>
<h4>    <a name="ifur" id="ifur"></a>FURS</h4>
<p>    Fur is seldom used for entire hats because of the weight and heat. Fur crowns
    are apt to be too heavy-looking for present-day fashions.</p>
<p>    Fur facings, fur edges, and fur trimmings are very smart.</p>
<p>    <strong><a name="ifur1" id="ifur1"></a>1. Seal.</strong> Seal is often used for entire brims in small hats, for irregular-fitted
    flanges, for rolled edges, and for cut-out work with beads and tinsel threads.</p>
<p>    <strong><a name="ifur2" id="ifur2"></a>2. Martin.</strong> Martin is used for coronets on small turbans, for edges on small,
    up-turned brims, and occasionally for edges.</p>
<p>    Baby martin is better fitted for millinery than any other fur because it
    is lighter weight and softer.</p>
<p>    <strong><a name="ifur3" id="ifur3"></a>3. Beaver. </strong>Beaver is used in the same way as seal (see <a href="#ifur1">above</a>).</p>
<p>    <strong><a name="ifur4" id="ifur4"></a>4. Mole.</strong> Mole, because it is lightweight and short-furred, makes entire crowns
    and small hats. It combines beautifully with brocades and satins. Wooden
    beads, brocade, tinsel thread, and mole are sometimes combined in an embroidery
    on satin hats.</p>
<p>    <strong><a name="ifur5" id="ifur5"></a>5. Monkey.</strong> Monkey is used in banding for edges on velvet, satin, and maline
    hats. It may be arranged in fanciful designs for ornaments to give aigrette-like
    effects.</p>
<p>    <strong><a name="ifur6" id="ifur6"></a>6. Astrakhan.</strong> Astrakhan is used for facings on turned-up brims, for a few
    entire turbans, and in combination with satin on small hats.</p>
<p>    <strong><a name="ifur7" id="ifur7"></a>7. Kolinsky.</strong> Kolinsky is used in the same way as martin (see <a href="#ifur2">page
76</a>).</p>
<h4>    <a name="irib" id="irib"></a>RIBBONS</h4>
<p>Both wide and narrow ribbons are used for entire hats in sport
  and tailored models.</p>
<p>Children's hats and rain hats may be made from moire ribbon,
    which is very durable.</p>
<h4><a name="ibraid" id="ibraid"></a>BRAIDS <span class="small">*(See <a href="m-08.html#ii">Lesson
VIII, section II</a>.)</span></h4>
<p><strong><a name="ibraid1" id="ibraid1"></a>1. Chenille.</strong> Chenille braid is used for entire hats in sports and
    tailored designs. Some of the fancy patterns of braid are combined with ribbonzene,
  narrow chenille, or yarn for embroidery work.</p>
<p><strong><a name="ibraid2" id="ibraid2"></a>2. Felt. </strong>Felt braids come in narrow
  and wide patterns for sport hats.</p>
<p><strong><a name="ibraid3" id="ibraid3"></a>3. Yarn. </strong>Yarn braids are used for entire
  sport hats, for edges on felt hats, and for embroidery work on sport hats.</p>
<h3><a name="ii" id="ii"></a>II.
    CLASSIFIED CONSTRUCTION OF FABRIC HATS FOR FALL AND WINTER</h3>
<h4><a name="iidr" id="iidr"></a>DRAPES</h4>
<p>Draped hats are like French frocks, apparently simple but in reality
  the last word in clever design and workmanship.</p>
<p>No one, no matter how talented,
    need expect to make finished and professional-looking draped hats without
  a great deal of practice.</p>
<p>Not everyone can succeed in being a trimmer or designer.</p>
<p>But anyone who is willing to work faithfully and to practice
    long enough can acquire deftness and skill that will enable her to copy designs,
    to do
      exquisite making, to drape a hat in soft, loose folds, to sew on trimming
      in a faultless manner. In other words, anyone who has average intelligence
      and who wills it may train her eyes to see and her hands to do what the
  mind directs.</p>
<p>Draped<strong><a href="illust/029.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,473);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/029-t.jpg" alt="Figure 29" width="151" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong> hats,<strong><a href="illust/028.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,427);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/028-t.jpg" alt="Figure 28" width="140" height="207" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong> more than any other type, need deftness of touch.
    The folds must be well secured but must look smooth and soft without any
  stitches showing
  anywhere.</p>
<p>For the average worker it is best to pin the entire drape first
    and tack it later. She may then adjust and readjust until the desired effect
  is obtained.</p>
<h6><strong>Figure 28. Draped Turban with Bias Side Crown.</strong></h6>
<h6><strong>Figure 29. Draped Turban with Bias Side Crown.</strong></h6>
<p class="clear"><strong><a name="iidr1" id="iidr1"></a>1. Matron's  turbans.</strong> Much is said elsewhere of matron's turbans
  (see <a href="m-10.html#i">Chapter X, section I</a>).</p>
<p>There are three invariably necessary qualities
    for a successful and becoming turban for the older girl and woman: (1) correct
  headsize; (2) a soft roll or tiny headsize brim; (3) softness.</p>
<p>A good method
    of practice is to prepare a soft, oval crown by adding a headsize binding
  of elastic net or an inch brim, and cutting a 7/8-yard length of velvet,
      one end bias and one end straight. Drape this in as many and as varied
  ways as possible. The simplest manner is to wind the bias around the headsize
    (slanting the true bias into a long bias if the brim needs more length to
  cover it) and pull the length around the crown into folds or pleats. The straight
  end may be finished in a series of shirrings to form a rosette or it may be
  laid in pleats and finished with a ribbon ornament, or with flowers or feathers,
  or a bow. The possibilities are endless.</p>
<p>Another safe drape is made by covering
    the headsize brim or coronet with a drape of bias folds, or covering it with
    an undraped bias which has been
  beaded or embroidered.</p>
<p>Then drape the top crown with an oval of velvet laid
  in loose folds or shirred a little at the center. Cover the side crown with
  shirred rosettes of ribbon, or velvet, or with a feather band.</p>
<p>A plain nine-inch
    bias of velvet may be draped in folds around the crown, as for a side crown,
    and wings or flowers to match the velvet, posed in groups
      around the crown.</p>
<p><strong><a href="illust/030.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,433);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/030-t.jpg" alt="Figure 30" width="138" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a><a name="iidr2" id="iidr2"></a>2. Harem turbans. </strong>(See <a href="m-10.html#ii">Chapter
X, section II</a>.)</p>
<h6><strong>Figure 30. Harem Turban with Section Top Crown.</strong></h6>
<h4 class="clear"><a name="iisd" id="iisd"></a>SEMIDRAPES</h4>
<p>Under this division come the simplest and some of the loveliest hats made;
  simple because exact patterns for crown and brim in one can be given; and lovely
  because they are soft and smart and make good background
for much pleasing handwork.</p>
<p><strong><a name="iisd1" id="iisd1"></a>1. Sectional hats. </strong>Sectional hats are usually sewn
    from the crown center down to the headsize. Seams may be plain, corded, or
    finished with fancy
      stitching. They may be made of velvet, satin soleil, or any fabric with
  body. Only very soft fabrics need an interlining.</p>
<p><em><strong><a href="illust/034.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',619,653);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/034-t.jpg" alt="Figure 34" width="151" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>Four-sectional.</em> Four-sectional
    hats may be shaped tams draped over a crown, or they may have a brim extension
    which turns up all around the crown. The latter are sometimes draped over
  rolled brims. Sometimes the fabric simply rolls up around the crown without
  a brim frame.</p>
<p>Exact dimensions and directions are always given with the patterns.</p>
<h6><strong>Figure 34. Four-Sectional Draped Hat.</strong></h6>
<p class="clear"><em><strong><a href="illust/032.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,551);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/032-t.jpg" alt="Figure 32" width="175" height="198" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>Six-sectional. </em>Six-sectional draped hats make good semitailored and sport hats. They may
  be of silk fabric, velvet, satin soleil, wide ribbon, or silk
  sports cloth. Narrow ribbon may be sewn horizontally in strips the width of
  the section pattern. Sections are cut from this, and the hat assembled in the
  usual way. This design gives a gay air of the unusual
  which is charming.</p>
<h6><strong><a name="fig32" id="fig32"></a>Figure 32. Six-Sectional Draped Hat.</strong></h6>
<p class="clear"><em><strong><a href="illust/031.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,451);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/031-t.jpg" alt="Figure 31" width="144" height="181" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>Two-sectional.</em> Two-sectional hats may be tams or may have
  the effect of brim and crown. Directions are always given with the pattern.</p>
<p>This
    type of hat makes a remarkably good design for young girls and is easy for
    beginning milliners to make. The results are satisfactory in either case.</p>
<h6><strong><a name="fig31" id="fig31"></a>Figure 31. Two-Sectional Draped Hat.</strong></h6>
<p class="clear"><strong><a name="iisd2" id="iisd2"></a>2.
    Tams.</strong> (See <a href="m-10.html#iii">Chapter X, section III</a>.) Draped tams are almost universally
  becoming. The soft width may always be becomingly adjusted to the individual
  face.</p>
<p>Here again, practice in draping makes for perfection of results. The
  tam drape must not look tight or pasted, nor can it be too loose and careless.</p>
<p>It
    is always well to adjust the drape carefully and to tack with the fewest
  possible stitches. A tie tack is commonly used for this. The ends of the thread
  are tied from inside the crown and the stitch caught through the under side
  of a fold on the outside. </p>
<p><em>Circular or fitted.</em> A circular tam may have a round
    or oval top. The outside is usually semicircular with the outer segment of
    the circle attached to
      the outer edge of the circle top. <em>Seams. </em>Since most tams drape
      lower at the right side than anywhere else, the seam is usually at the
      right side.</p>
<p>Directions
    are always given with each pattern. </p>
<p><em>Sectional tams</em>.</p>
<p><em>a</em>. Four-sectional tams.<em><strong><a href="illust/033.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,523);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/033-t.jpg" alt="Figure 33" width="168" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em>  Four-sectional tams are cut in two distinct manners: (1) to give a decided
    sectional effect; (2) to show no seams but to give
      desired effect for the shape of the drape. It will readily be seen that
  four seams give much help in attaining a desired shape.</p>
<h6><strong><a name="fig33" id="fig33"></a>Figure 33. Four-Sectional Tam.</strong></h6>
<p class="clear"><em>b</em>. Six-sectional tams.
    Six-sectional tams are usually for misses and juniors. Soft and unusual
  effects are easily obtained. Embroidery, ribbon ornaments, or quills may serve
  as trimming (see <a href="m-10.html#iii">Chapter X, section III</a>).</p>
<p><strong><em><a href="illust/035.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',590,465);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/035-t.jpg" alt="Figure 35" width="156" height="193" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="iisd3" id="iisd3"></a>3. Saddle tams. </strong>Saddle tams have
    a shaped section running from side to side across the top of the hat. The
  front and back may be in one or two sections
  each. The shaping gives an unusual line for drape.</p>
<p>The construction is easy
    and therefore furnishes a good problem for the beginner.</p>
<h6><strong><a name="fig35" id="fig35"></a>Figure 35. Saddle tam.</strong></h6>
<h4 class="clear"><a name="iifh" id="iifh"></a>FITTED HATS</h4>
<p>Fitted hats are divided into two general classes&#8212;pasted
  and unpasted. Because of the present popularity of soft hats there are few
  pasted hats.
    Paste is used to hold material to a concave surface, but otherwise it is
not frequently used.</p>
<p><strong><a name="iifh1" id="iifh1"></a>1. Fitted, unpasted hats.</strong> This classification includes most
    of the brim hats. The fabric is fitted over a brim and sewn at the headsize
    and edge. Mushrooms,
  turned-up brims, pokes, and small sailors are usually fitted and covered in
  the same way. Turned-up brims may have the top or the facing put on first,
  but the processes are the same.</p>
<p><em><a name="edfi" id="edfi"></a>Edge finishes:</em></p>
<h6><strong><em><a href="illust/036.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',547,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/036-t.jpg" alt="Figure 36" width="180" height="119" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Figure 36. Edge-Wire Finish. <span class="small">Note that there
    is no stitch on the top&#8212;only between the hat edge and the cord.</span></strong></h6>
<h6><strong><em><a href="illust/037.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,699);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/037-t.jpg" alt="Figure 37" width="180" height="149" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Figure 37. Edge-Wire Finish. <span class="small">The position of
      the needle shows the way in which the stitches travel.</span></strong></h6>
<p class="clear"><em>a.</em> Plain, wire edges. These are the edges commonly used in fitted
    hats. The under facing is fitted to the frame and sewn to the headsize with
a backstitch.</p>
<p>The seam, if any, may be slip-stitched before or after the edge
    wire is pinned in. Starting at the right-side back, pin the edge of the material
    over and
    under a facing wire, placing the pins just under the wire in the material
  and through the frame. Pin only half the facing in this manner.</p>
<p>Sew by running
    the needle along under the wire to form a groove for the placement of stitches,
    which should be not more than one-fourth inch underneath. Slant
      the needle through the material to the edge and back without any stitches
    on top. The thread from under the wire to the edge above should be brought
  back (by the needle) under the wire. Thus it forms a stitch which does not
  show when the
    thread is pulled tight.</p>
<p>When half the facing is finished, pin the other half
    and sew, leaving a two-inch space open for the wire joining. When ready for
    this, cut the two ends of
      the wire evenly and slip a wire joiner on to hold the two ends. A wire
  joiner is made like the tip of a shoe lace (not a bad substitute) and may be
  bought
  in any good department store. Sew
    over the wire joiner and sew the material to the frame headsize with a whip-stitch.</p>
<p><em>b.</em>  Slip-stitched edges. The top facing is fitted and pinned in place. The center
    slashes are sewn at the headsize with a backstitch, which is run just
      above the headsize bend or wire. The edge is carefully fitted, and pins
  are adjusted to hold it in place.</p>
<p>A quarter-inch or half-inch seam is trimmed
  and caught down on the under side of the frame with a whip-stitch. Stitches
  must be close together so
    as to hold the edge flat. No stitches should show on the top. The needle
    is stuck through the fabric and frame&#8212;not through to the fabric on
  top.</p>
<p>The seam is turned under on each side and slip-stitched from headsize to
      edge by taking a hidden stitch in first one side and then the other. The
    needle must always enter one fold in a line exactly opposite the point from
  which it was pulled from the other side. Pull the thread so that it holds the
  seam together but not tight enough to
    pucker it.</p>
<h6><strong><em><a href="illust/038.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,620);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/038-t.jpg" alt="Figure 38" width="180" height="180" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Figure 38. Brim Hat with Flange Edge.</strong></h6>
<p> <em><strong><a name="fled" id="fled"></a></strong>c. </em>Flange edges. When flange edges are used, the facing (top or
      under, whichever is used) is sewn at the headsize as usual, and at the
  outer edge, which extends out on the frame so that it laps one-half inch under
      the flange. It is pinned flat, and sewn with a backstitch. The stitches
  may be half an inch long, but must be tight so that no fullness accumulates
  under
  them.</p>
<p>The flange may be bias or fitted. Directions are always given on the
    pattern. In either case the edge is sewn as for a plain, fitted hat (see
  above).</p>
<p>The inner edge of the flange is pinned over a wire as for a facing edge (see
<em><a href="#edfi">Edge finishes</a></em> above).</p>
<p>The only difference in sewing is that the needle may be
    stuck through the frame as the stitches showing there are hidden by the facing.
    Take a small
  stitch close under the wire and a small one on the under brim. Use a matching
  silk thread. When there are but five or six inches left to sew, clip the wire
  ends, slip on the joiner, and clamp
  it over the wire ends well.</p>
<p>Do not put the joiner under a seam. It will show
    less where there is no extra thickness. Finish sewing the flange. </p>
<p>Put in
    the facing as for a plain, fitted
      edge.</p>
<p> <em>d.</em> Fold edges. Fitted, fold edges finish the hat so that the raw
      edge of facings, both top and bottom, are sewn flat at the brim edge (or
    near the edge) of the hat with a backstitch as for a flange (see <em><a href="#fled">Flange
    edges</a></em>  above).</p>
<p>When tailored stiff hats are in vogue, there are many bias-edge folds
    used as finishes. These are put on as a flange is put on, except that there
    is
      no edge-wire finish. The bias strip of material is folded over the raw
  edges of the facing. The inner edge of bias material is finished over a wire
  or
  cord as a flange is finished.</p>
<p>Care must be used to keep the top and bottom
    wires even, so that the stitches of one may be slanted under the wire of
  the other.</p>
<p>(1) Loose folds. Since soft edges are becoming, loose folds are very
    popular. After the top brim is put on and before the facing is put in, a
  bias fold
      of material is fitted around the edge of the hat (with the fold edge extending
      out). The two raw edges of the fold are sewn down to the frame over the
  raw edge of the top facing. It is best to pin, fit, and seam the fold before
      sewing it. Seams should be placed at either side of the back when more
  than
      one is necessary. Otherwise, the seam is directly at the back. The facing
      edge is finished just as for a plain, fitted hat. Many maline fold edges
    are put on dress hats in this manner.</p>
<p>(2) Extended folds. The raw edges of
    the bias fold may be held slightly full so that the outer edge extends beyond
    the frame edge. These folds are usually
    &frac34; to 1&frac12; inches finished.</p>
<p>(3) Turned-back folds. These folds are usually
    &frac12; to &frac34; inch finished. The fold may be turned back over the top brim merely
    to give a soft-edge
      effect. In this case turn the folded edge back over the top and stretch
  the raw edges as the fold is pinned in place at the facing edge. This makes
  the
  fold edge lie flat without any fullness.</p>

<p class="clear"><em>e. </em>Machine-stitched and turned
    edges. This is one of the simplest edge finishes and is used by the better
    factories. Both top and under facings are sewn at the headsize and trimmed
  and sewn flat  fold is measured around the
    frame edge, allowing no fullness; and for a small hat, stretching the bias
    just a little. <em><strong><a href="illust/040.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,482);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/040-t.jpg" alt="Figure 40" width="170" height="214" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em>The seams are joined
      after the fold is fitted. The two raw edges must be brought together and
      basted so that the fold lies flat and even. The fold, when finished, may
      be from &frac34; to 1&frac14; inches wide. Pin the two raw edges even with the frame
    edge on the under side of the brim. Sew with a tight backstitch. Then turn
  the fold over onto the top of the brim. Factories sew this with a straw-sewing
  machine rather than
    by hand.</p>

<p class="clear"><strong><a name="iifh2" id="iifh2"></a>2. Fitted, pasted hats.</strong></p>
<p class="clear"><em>Machine-pasted hats.</em> Most machine-made velvet and many
  silk hats are pasted. These include many of the larger cheap velvet hats.</p>
<p>Knox
    sailors and many of the smart tailored-velvet and satin-soleil hats are pasted
    and pressed by machine. These have ribbon-edge bindings or glued-wire finishes.</p>
<p><em>Hand-pasted
    hats.</em> In making a pasted hat, the facings are fitted and sewn at the headsize.
    The glue is then smeared evenly over the frame, a section
      (about a quarter of the brim) at a time. The material is carefully smoothed
      over the glue by rubbing with the hand from the headsize out to the edge.
      If fullness is accidentally left in, pull the material loose before the
  glue dries and smooth it over again.</p>
<p>Be careful to purchase a good quality of
    millinery glue or cement. Ordinary glue mars the fabric.</p>
<p>Do not try to paste
    any fabric which has not much body. Velvet, satin soleil, suede cloth, duvetyn,
    heavy satin, moire1, and heavy faille are about the
      only fabrics that will not mar when paste is used.</p>
<h4><a name="iisf" id="iisf"></a>SEWING FUR</h4>
<p>In sewing fur remember (1) that the fur should always run the same
    way; (2) that a richer light is given when the fur shades rough; (3) that
  the hair
  must not be cut off in cutting the skin.</p>
<p><strong><a name="iisf1" id="iisf1"></a>1. Fitting.</strong> In fitting a fur hat use
    a pattern for the space, or crown, or facing to be fitted. Pin the fur to
  the pattern wrong side out to join the seams. Before the last seam is joined,
  pin the fur to the frame, stretching it smooth, and take out any extra fullness
  in the last
  seam.</p>
<p>To get the best results, the hide side of the fur pelt should be dampened
      (not the fur) and the skin stretched and tacked fur side down on a table
      or board to dry. This gives a larger surface, saving fur and detracting
  from the weight per square inch. Banding already made does not need stretching.</p>
<p><strong><a name="iisf2" id="iisf2"></a>2.
    Cutting.</strong> Fur should always be marked with pencil or chalk on the skin side
    and cut with a knife on the marking line. A safety-razor blade is a
      good substitute for a fur knife. Hold the fur so that the fur hair will
  not be cut when the skin is.</p>
<p><strong><a name="iisf3" id="iisf3"></a>3. Sewing.</strong> Hold the two edges of skin to be sewed
    together with all the hair pushed inside. Sew with whip stitches or overcasting
  stitches so close together that the seam stands up in a cord.</p>
<p>If the hair has
    not been cut and the two pieces of fur shade the same way, the fur can be
  sewn so that the seam does not show on the right side.</p>
<p>After the seams are finished,
    whip a narrow tape to the outer edge of the fur with close, fine stitches.
    Use this tape to sew to the hat frame or to
      turn back and whip down onto the skin back for a band or bow of fur. Bows
    of fur may have silk facings slip-stitched to this tape.</p>
<p><strong><a name="iisf4" id="iisf4"></a>4. Equipment needed. </strong>Thumb tacks; razor blades; chalk; strong, fine, cotton thread (Geneva No.
    40 is good); and short, strong needles are all the equipment
      that is necessary for fur work in millinery.</p>

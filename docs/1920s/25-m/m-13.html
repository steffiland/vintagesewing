<h2>CHAPTER XIII&#8212;CLEANING AND REMODELING</h2>
    
    <h3><a name="i" id="i"></a>I. CLEANING</h3>
    
    <h4><a name="ileg" id="ileg"></a>LEGHORNS</h4>
    
    <p>Materials of good quality stand remodeling better than cheaper ones. This
    holds true of all materials under, all processes.</p>
    
    <p>A good leghorn may be cleaned, pressed, and reused many times. It is advisable
    never to let a leghorn hat get very dirty, but to clean it frequently.</p>
    
    <p>Cleaning processes <strong>1</strong> and <strong>2</strong> may be used without taking the trimming from the
    hat.</p>
    
    <p><strong><a name="ileg1" id="ileg1"></a>1. Rye-bread process.</strong> To keep a fine leghorn hat in good condition clean
    it for every ten times it is worn.</p>
    
    <p>Cut about four inches from the end of a day-old loaf of rye bread. Hold the
    end of the loaf in the right hand and scrub the hat with the cut end. The
    gummy texture of the bread rubs off the dust as you scrub. When all dust
    has been removed, brush the hat with a good, stiff brush.</p>
    
    <p><strong><a name="ileg2" id="ileg2"></a>2. Wall-paper-cleaner process. </strong>When a hat is very much
      soiled and you do not want to rip it, purchase any good wall-paper cleaner.
      Apply it as for
    wall paper. Brush thoroughly with a stiff brush.</p>
    
    <p><strong><a name="ileg3" id="ileg3"></a>3. Soap-and-water process. </strong>When a leghorn is very much soiled and is to be
    remodeled, rip all trimmings and facings and brush thoroughly.</p>
    
    <p>Stretch the crown over a wooden block which is the shape that you want it
    to be when dry. A stiff buckram crown may be used.</p>
    
    <p>Fasten the brim down to the table with thumb tacks at intervals of two inches
    around the edge. Place about six tacks around through the center of the brim.</p>
    <p>Use a suds made of Ivory Soap Flakes. Apply with a brush that has short,
    stiff bristles. Scrub well. Rinse with a brush and clean water.</p>
    
    <p>Wipe as dry as possible with a soft, absorbent cloth. Allow it to dry thoroughly.</p>
    
    <p>Before removing the hat from the block, take the tacks from the brim. Press
    brim and crown with a moderately hot iron. Use a thickness of mull or crinoline
    over the leghorn so that the iron cannot scorch it.</p>
    
    <p>For reshaping see section II of this chapter.</p>
    <h4><a name="imil" id="imil"></a>MILANS</h4>
    
    <p><strong><a name="imil1" id="imil1"></a>1. Dyed milans.</strong> A dyed milan may be cleaned by wiping it with a cloth of
    the same color dipped in ammonia solution.</p>
    
    <p><strong><a name="imil2" id="imil2"></a><a name="imil2" id="imil2"></a>2. Natural milans.</strong> To clean a natural-colored milan, have ready a sauce dish
    or deep, small container with a rounded tablespoon of sulphur and a lemon
    cut in half. Dip the cut end of the lemon in the sulphur, pressing it down
    until a considerable amount of sulphur is absorbed by the lemon juice.</p>
    <p>Rub the milan well with this lemon. When the sulphur is rubbed off into the
    straw, dip the lemon into the container again. When the entire hat has been
    covered with the sulphur-lemon solution allow it to stand one hour. Then
    brush the hat well with a very stiff brush.</p>
    
    <p><em>Oxalic-acid process.</em> In using oxalic acid for cleaning straw dilute the acid
    with water using a half and half solution.</p>
    
    <p>Wipe off the acid with a soft cloth which has been dipped in weak ammonia.</p>
    
    <h4><a name="ipan" id="ipan"></a>PANAMAS</h4>
    <p><strong><a name="ipan1" id="ipan1"></a>1. Wall-paper-cleaner process. </strong>(See <a href="#i">section
    I</a>.)</p>
    
    <p><strong><a name="ipan2" id="ipan2"></a>2. Rye-bread process.</strong> (See <a href="#i">section
    I</a>.)</p>
    
    <h4><a name="isb" id="isb"></a>STRAW BRAID</h4>
    <p><strong><a name="isb1" id="isb1"></a>1. Wall-paper-cleaner process. </strong>Straw braid may be cleaned, either on the
      hat or ripped from the hat, by following directions given on any good wall-paper
    cleaner. </p>
    
    <p><strong><a name="isb2" id="isb2"></a>2. Cleaning fluid.</strong> Dip a soft cloth, the color of the straw braid to be cleaned,
    into the cleaning fluid, and wipe the braid thoroughly with it.</p>
    
    <p><strong><a name="isb3" id="isb3"></a>3. Soap-and-water process.</strong> A good quality of straw braid
      may be scrubbed with a brush which has been dipped in an Ivory Soap Flakes
      solution. Rinse
    in clear, warm water. Shake partially dry. Wrap in newspaper. Allow it to
    stand for one hour, and press.</p>
    
    <p><strong><a name="isb4" id="isb4"></a>4. Pressing braids.</strong> Always press straw braid on the wrong side with a moderately
    hot iron. Too hot an iron will stick to the straw. Too much water will tend
    to run the braid strands together.</p>
    
    <h4><a name="iflo" id="iflo"></a>FLOWERS</h4>
    
    <p>Often good flowers are only dusty, not faded. These can be reused if they
    are cleaned. Flowers that have a good shape, but are faded, may be dyed a
    new color. Flowers that are only crumpled may be pressed and made to look
    like new.</p>
    
    <p><strong><a name="iflo1" id="iflo1"></a>1. Cleaning fluid. </strong>Flowers
      can be washed with a cleaning fluid which dries rapidly. Dip them in the
      cleaner (gasoline may be used) and rub with a soft
    brush. Shake them dry.</p>
    
    <p><strong><a name="iflo2" id="iflo2"></a>2. Dyeing.</strong> If the flowers to be dyed are soiled, they should first be cleaned
    in gasoline.</p>
    
    <p>For the tinting, mix oil paint with gasoline and dip the flowers in the solution.
    Always try one flower first to get the shade.</p>
    
    <p>Lovely effects are obtained by using two shades. For example, if faded white
    lilacs are to be tinted, dip them first in a soft blue solution. Let this
    dry. Dip just the tips in a dark rose or dull red solution. An infinite variety
    of lovely effects may be obtained in this way.</p>
    
    <p>Calcimine (ordinary dry calcimine used for walls) may be mixed with gasoline
    and used to dye flowers.</p>
    
    <p><strong><a name="iflo3" id="iflo3"></a>3. Pressing. </strong>If flowers are only crumpled they may be freshened by pressing
    each petal and leaf with a moderately hot iron. Place the flower flat on
    the ironing board and, starting with the center petals, work to the outer
    edge.</p>
    
    <p>Small flowers may be crushed flat, when they are crumpled, to form a flower
    facing or to be used for a turban. Put a moderately hot iron on top of the
    flower and let it stand for two minutes.</p>
    <h4><a name="ifea" id="ifea"></a>FEATHERS</h4>
    
    <p>Any really good feathers may be cleaned and reused many times. Pasted wings
    and feathers may be protected by maline when they are first put on a hat.
    They are never very satisfactorily remodeled once they are blown.</p>
    
    <p><strong><a name="ifea1" id="ifea1"></a>1. Ostrich.</strong></p>
    
    <p><em>Cleaning fluid.</em> To clean ostrich prepare two deep bowls. In the first make
    a suds of cleaner, such as gasoline, and Ivory Soap Flakes. In the second
    put clear gasoline.</p>
    
    <p>Wash the ostrich in the first bowl. Wash and rub it thoroughly just as though
    you were shampooing it. Rinse all the soap out in the second bowl. Shake
    the ostrich dry.</p>
    
    <p>The tips may then be curled slightly, although at present most ostrich is
    used straight.</p>
    <p><em>Curling process</em>. The best method for the amateur to use for curling
      ostrich is the heat method. Heat gives a soft curl just as moisture straightens
      the
    ostrich fronds. Hold the plumes over a low-burning gas flame, in the smoke
    from burning sugar, or over a hot steam radiator. Sugar placed in an iron
    skillet and allowed to burn sends up a heavy smoke which is admirably adapted
    for the purpose.</p>
    
    <p>Always try a few ostrich fronds to test the force of the heat lest it
      burn the ostrich.</p>
    
    <p>A novice is apt to break the fiber if she uses a curling knife. </p>
    <p><strong><a name="ifea2" id="ifea2"></a>2. Aigrettes.</strong>      In handling aigrettes, be careful not to break the center stem or quill.</p>
    <p><em>Soap and water. </em>The process given is for white aigrettes. Colored ones may
    be washed in the same way. They, of course, do not need whitening.</p>
    
    <p>Have ready two deep, medium-sized bowls; in one make a strong solution of
    Ivory Soap Flakes and lukewarm water. In the second put clear, lukewarm water.</p>
    
    <p>Shampoo the feathers well in the soapy water. Rinse thoroughly in the clear
    water. Shake out all the loose drops of water. Roll the feathers in a bath
    towel. Let them stand ten minutes.</p>
    
    <p><em>Whitener.</em> Place a quantity of cornstarch in a flat, long box or on a large
    plate. Shake the feathers until the fibers begin to loosen up and fluff out.
    Then roll them in cornstarch. Shake the feathers until dry, rolling them
    frequently in the starch.</p>
    <h4><a name="ilace" id="ilace"></a>LACE</h4>
    
    <p>Almost any kind of lace may be cleaned and reused.</p>
    
    <p><strong><a name="ilace1" id="ilace1"></a>1. Washing.</strong> Any silk, linen, or cotton lace may be washed.</p>
    
    <p><em>Soap-and-water process.</em> White, cream, or 6cru lace may be washed with any
    good, white soap. The soap must be thoroughly rinsed out. Wrap the lace in
    a towel. Wring it as dry as possible. Press with a moderately hot iron.</p>
    
    <p><em>Cleaning-fluid process. </em>Colored laces may be washed in cleaning fluid and
    soap, and rinsed in clear cleaning fluid. Shake almost dry and press on the
    wrong side with a moderately hot iron.</p>
    
    <p><em>Pressing.</em> Black and dark laces often need only be shaken well and pressed
    with a hot iron.</p>
    
    <p><strong><a name="ilace2" id="ilace2"></a>2. Tinting.</strong> Very cheap laces may be made to look quite unusual by tinting
    them. Valenciennes (val.) lace, ruffling, and all-over lace take on a very
    different appearance when they become soft &eacute;cru, dull blue, or rose. Mix
    ordinary calcimine with water. Dip the lace, shake it partially dry, and
    press on the wrong side.</p>
    
    <h4><a name="ifelt" id="ifelt"></a>FELTS</h4>
    <p>Light felts can be kept in good condition only if they are cleaned frequently.
    Never allow them to get really soiled.</p>
    
    <p><strong><a name="ifelt1" id="ifelt1"></a>1. Cleaning fluid.</strong> Dip a soft cloth in cleaning fluid, rub it over the felt
    with the nap. Brush the felt dry with a soft, clean brush.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="ifelt2" id="ifelt2"></a>2. Art gum.</strong> Art gum will remove spots or streaks from felt when they are
    not made by a liquid. Coal soot, pencil marks, or dust are easily removed
    by rubbing art gum over the felt.</p>
    
    <p><strong><a name="ifelt3" id="ifelt3"></a>3. Fuller's earth.</strong> Cover the felt with a thick coat of fuller's earth. Wrap
    a dry cloth around it and let it stand overnight. Brush all the earth out
    with a stiff hat brush.</p>
    <h4><a name="ivel" id="ivel"></a>VELVETS</h4>
    
    <p>Velvets, like any other fabric, should not be allowed to get very much soiled.
    Better results are obtained when they are cleaned frequently.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="ivel1" id="ivel1"></a>1. Cleaning fluid. </strong>Dip a soft cloth (a piece of the same material as that
    being cleaned is always preferable) in cleaning fluid and rub it lightly
    over the velvet. Much light rubbing will not mar the velvet, though pressure
    will mar it very easily.</p>
    
    <p><strong><a name="ivel2" id="ivel2"></a>2. Refinishing. </strong>Velvet may be given a new finish and an entirely different
    appearance in either of two ways.</p>
    
    <p><em>Mirroring</em>. This process is really only sponging and pressing. A very hot
    iron and much sponging are necessary. Always run the iron with the nap of
    the velvet.</p>
    
    <p>Pull all threads from the velvet. Place it flat on the board. Sponge all
    over with a very wet cloth rubbed over the surface with the nap. Press with
    a hot. iron. Run the iron lightly over the velvet first. Press down with
    more weight the second time. Responge and press until the velvet has a smooth
    and shining surface.</p>
    
    <p><em>Crushed finish.</em> To make crushed velvet, clean it first (see <a href="#ivel1">above</a>). Then
    dip in clear water for only an instant. The velvet should be just barely
    wet, not soaked. Wring loosely and shake. Hang it over a line to dry. This
    gives a crushed effect which is very pretty. Crushed velvets are used for
    draped hats and for fitted hats in combination with plain materials.</p>
    <h4><a name="iph" id="iph"></a>PRESSED HATS</h4>
    
    <p><strong><a name="iph1" id="iph1"></a>1. Cutting.</strong> Pressed hats, both straw and felt, may often be cut and reshaped
    to look like new. If the shape needs to be changed at the headsize, it is
    best to rip or cut the crown from the brim.</p>
    
    <p><em>Crowns.</em> Old crowns may be raised to make them higher by cutting them and
    setting in a piece of buckram.</p>
    
    <p>They may be cut and lapped to make the headsize smaller. A soft crown
      is usually draped over the left side. Slash the crown up 1&frac12; inches at
      the
    left. Lap a seam and sew it flat. If the headsize is still too large, slash
    and lap the side crown, where the seam will be covered by the hat trimming.</p>
    
    <p><em>Brims.</em> Pressed hat brims may be cut and reshaped just as pressed frame brims
    are cut (see <a href="m-02.html#i">Chapter II, section I</a>).</p>
    
    <p><strong><a name="iph2" id="iph2"></a>2. Edge finishes. </strong>The cut-brim edges in most cases need to be rewired (as
    a frame edge is wired). This wire must be covered. There are several methods
    to choose from.</p>
    <p><em>Fabric folds.</em> The edge may be finished with a bias fold of silk,
      satin, or velvet. These folds may be finished with an embroidery stitch;
      they may
    be slip-stitched on both edges; or the fabric may be worked over a wire.</p>
    
    <p><em>Ribbon binding.</em> Narrow grosgrain or fancy ribbons stretched over the edge
    make a good, tailored finish. The edges may be slip-stitched down or sewed
    with long, embroidery-thread stitches.</p>
    
    <p><em>Fancy-straw braids</em> may be sewed over the edge of straw brims.</p>
    
    <p>Chenille or yarn braids are effective for felt hats. These braids may be
    caught down with embroidery silk, yarn, chenille, or ribbonzene, or they
    may be sewn with a slip-stitch.</p>
    
    <p><em>Blanket-stitch edges. </em>For sport hats both straws and felts may have the edge
    wire covered by a blanket stitch of heavy yarn, chenille, or ribbonzene.</p>

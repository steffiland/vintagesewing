<h2>  CHAPTER V&#8212;STAPLE MILLINERY MATERIALS</h2>
<h3><a name="i" id="i"></a>I. MATERIALS USED</h3>
    <p>The definitions and tests given in this lesson apply
        to millinery fabrics only. The qualities desirable for hat fabrics, such
        as velvet or satin, are
      very different from the qualities desired in the same fabrics when they
      are to be used for dresses. Hat materials must be nicely finished; the
      velvet
      pile, deep ; the satin, lustrous. They must be light in weight. They need
      have no enduring wearing qualities. There is no strain on hat materials
      as there is on material for other wearing apparel.</p>
    <h4><a name="if" id="if"></a>FABRICS</h4>
    <p> <strong><a name="if1" id="if1"></a>1. Velvets.</strong></p>
    <p><em>Process of manufacture.</em> Velvet is a soft, thick fabric
        with a deep silk pile. The warp is woven on a cotton woof. In a very
      expensive quality there is
    a silk back, or woof.</p>
    <p>In weaving the warp the silk is passed over fine wires
        in such a way as to form rows of loops which project from the cotton
      back. When the wires are
    withdrawn there is left a fine, soft, silk pile.</p>
    <p> In uncut velvet these
      loops are left intact. </p>
    <p>For most millinery velvet the loops are cut with
          a sharp
        tool to make what is called cut velvet.</p>
    <p>The best quality of millinery velvet
        is silk Lyons. The name is derived from the city of Lyons, in France,
      where much of it is made. For this, first-grade
    silk stock, called the first spinning, is used. </p>
    <p>The trade of velvet weaving
      is a closed trade handed down from father to son. Velvet manufacturers
      say that &quot;a velvet loom improves with usage.
    It takes one hundred years to perfect one of the looms for the finest weaving.&quot; During
    the World War many of these looms were allowed to rust and ruin.</p>
    <p>For cheaper
      velvets, called chap velvets, the second spinning is used. For this second
      grade of silk velvet, the knots, ravelings, and ends of silk left from
      the first spinning are boiled and dissolved in a prepared solution and
      respun.
      A cheaper grade of cotton woof is used than
    for the Lyons velvet.</p>
    <p><em>Tests of quality. </em>Millinery velvet must have a close,
        soft nap which does not allow the woof, or back, to show through. It
      must be very light in weight
      but have body which holds it up. It should be silky in effect, showing
      light and shadow in such a way as to give an appearance of depth to black
      velvets
      and an effect of many shades of the same color to colored velvets. This
      effect is the result of the play of light on the deep silk pile.</p>
    <p><em>Varieties. </em>The varieties used for millinery are the only ones given.</p>
    <p><em>Silk Lyons velvet</em>      is used for fitted and draped hats, both large and small. It is also
      used for handmade flowers and appliqu&eacute; embroidery.</p>
    <p><em>Chiffon</em> or<em> uncut velvet</em>      is really a dress fabric but is occasionally used for draped hats and
      often used for children's hats.</p>
    <p><em>Chap velvet</em> is used for less expensive hats.
        It has a higher lustre than Lyons velvet and is used for juniors' and
    children's hats.</p>
    <p><em>Soleil</em> or <em>panne</em> is Lyons velvet which is mirrored, or panned,
        by machine on the bias. To mirror on the bias gives a different gloss
      than to mirror
      on the straight of the material.</p>
    <p><em>Paon velvet</em> is chap velvet which has been
        mirrored on the straight. It has a high lustre but is a cheaper and a
    heavier-weight material than soleil.</p>
    <p><em>Plush</em> is woven of silk and wool. The
        weave is the same as for velvet. Only very lightweight plushes can be
      used for hats. Usually satin or taffeta is
      used in combination to keep the hat from being heavy or thick-looking.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="if2" id="if2"></a>2.
        Silks.</strong></p>
    <p><em>Tests of quality</em>. Tests of quality for silks in millinery are the same
      as those for dress silks. None of the very thin grades of silks and satins
      is good. Messaline satin or thin taffeta, for example, are not fit
    to use because they draw needle slits wherever a stitch is taken on a frame.
    Even with an interlining it is impossible to make a nice hat from them.</p>
    <p><em>Varieties
      of silks. </em>There are, nevertheless, a number of silks that can be used.</p>
    <p><em>Cr&ecirc;pes</em>.
        Cr&ecirc;pe is a silk fabric woven with a spongy surface. Raw silk or a silk
    and wool mixture is used for the weaving.</p>
    <p>Georgette is a very thin cr&ecirc;pe
        of silk and wool. The texture, though thin, is very strong. It is used
        for summer hats, for transparent hats, for children's
      hats, for facings in straw and velvet hats, and for handmade flowers. Folds
      of georgette are used in embroidery designs.</p>
    <p>Canton cr&ecirc;pe is a very heavy
        cr&ecirc;pe with a rough surface. It is used for summer and mid-season hats
    and for facings in velvet hats.</p>
    <p>Cr&ecirc;pe de chine is a medium-weight, dull
        cr&ecirc;pe used for summer hats, for children's hats, and for facings in straw
        and velvet hats. For all-over-embroidery hats
      cr&ecirc;pe de chine makes a good foundation.</p>
    <p><em>Taffeta</em> is used for early spring
        hats, for combination with straw braids, and for facings in straw and
    velvet hats.</p>
    <p><em>Satin</em> should always have a high lustre for millinery use. It
        is used for fall and midwinter hats and in combination with velvet and
        straw, both as
      a drape and for facings.</p>
    <p><em>Chiffon</em> is a silk gauze-like material used for
      transparent hats and for shirred children's hats.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="if3" id="if3"></a>3. Cotton and linen
      fabrics.</strong></p>
    <p><em>Tests of quality</em> are the same as for dress goods of the same
        type.</p>
    <p><em>Varieties</em> used for hats are many. Only the chief ones are listed.</p>
    <p><em>Organdies</em>,
        plain and embroidered, are used for lingerie and sport hats and for handmade
    flowers.</p>
    <p><em>Linens</em>, plain, figured, and embroidered, are used only for sport
        hats. The colors and textures are very lovely and lend themselves to
      fancy appliqu&eacute;
      and stitchings.</p>
    <p><em>Cretonnes</em>, in figured designs in both cotton and linen,
        are used for sport and lingerie hats.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="if4" id="if4"></a>4. Laces.</strong></p>
    <p><em>Tests of quality</em> may be limited to appearance. A tinsel lace
        must not have cotton threads and must not be too heavy. Black laces should
        be silk, as
      cotton fades to a dull green in the sun.</p>
    <p><em>Varieties</em>. There are three kinds
      of laces used in making hats.</p>
    <p><em>Silk laces</em> are used in black for transparent
        dress hats and for trimmings. &Eacute;cru silk laces are used for lingerie dress
      hats.</p>
    <p><em>Cotton laces</em> are used in &eacute;cru or in tints for trimmings on children's
      hats and for lingerie hats.</p>
    <p><em>Tinsel laces</em> are used in winter for making
        dress hats in transparent models, for draped turbans, and for cut-out
    appliqu&eacute;s on fabric hats.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="if5" id="if5"></a>5. Straw cloths. </strong>Straw cloths are made of various
        compositions, made to look like straw. <em>Candy cloth, visca cloth</em>, and
        <em>hair cloth</em> are the ones in greatest
      usage.</p>
    <h4><a name="ib" id="ib"></a>BRAIDS</h4>
    <p><strong><a name="ib1" id="ib1"></a>1. Tests for quality.</strong> The tests for quality for braids are mainly
        those of appropriateness, of beauty, and of weight. For dress hats, smooth
        braids
      with a high lustre are most effective. Beauty of color and texture in braid
      always makes for a better looking hat. Weight is always a problem to be
      considered. A braid loosely woven needs an interlining, so it must not
      be both loose and heavy. </p>
    <p><strong><a name="ib2" id="ib2"></a>2. Varieties.</strong> The braids used in millinery are
      of many kinds.</p>
    <p><em>Chenille braid</em> is a soft woolen braid woven in a variety
        of colors. It comes in lovely shades and is used for sport hats and for
      embroidery.</p>
    <p><em>Yarn braids</em> are used entirely for sport hats. Crowns at least
    may be sewn without a foundation. </p>
    <p><em>Visca braid</em> comes under the class of
        straw braids, but is really a composition. It has a high lustrous finish
        and is appropriate for both dress and street
    hats.</p>
    <p><em>Celophane braid</em> is made of a celluloid composition. It has much the
        same finish as patent leather and is used for dress and street hats.
      A combination
    of hair braid and celophane braid is very effective.</p>
    <p><em>Hemp braid</em> is woven
        from hemp straw and is used for sport and street hats and for facings
      in summer fabric hats. It comes in fine stripping&frac14; to 1/16
      inch wide. This is used for machine-sewn hats and for embroidery. When
      used for hand-sewn hats the stripping is machine stitched in rows to form
      a braid
      of &frac34; to 7/8 inch wide. It is then sewn by hand as any other braid is
    sewn.</p>
    <p><em>Lis&egrave;re braid</em> is woven of fine wheat straw. It comes in stripping which
        is very narrow. This is sewn by machine for pressed-hat work. For hand-sewn
      hats the stripping is sewn up by machine to make a braid &frac12; to &frac34; inch
    wide. The finer qualities are very narrow.</p>
    <p><em>Milan braid</em> is woven from fine
        wheat straw. It derives its name from the city of Milan where it is extensively
        manufactured. It is used in the same
      way as hemp and lis&egrave;re. See paragraphs above.</p>
    <p><em>Hair</em> is a transparent braid
    woven from a composition. There are three qualities: (1) Swiss hair, the
        best quality; (2) German, a medium grade; and (3) domestic, a very inferior
        quality. The better grade
      has a fine hair, a good lustre, and body. The cheaper braids are shiny,
    sleazy, and have not much body.</p>
    <p>Hair braid is used for transparent hats
        in summer and for combination with silk and taffeta on early spring hats.
      The latter are made on pressed frames.</p>
    <h4><a name="ibod" id="ibod"></a>BODY HATS </h4>
    <p>Body hats are hats that
      have brim and crown woven in one.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="ibod1" id="ibod1"></a>1. Process of manufacture.</strong> The process
        of manufacture varies with the kind of hat. Most of the better straws,
        such as panamas, leghorns, and tuscan
      straws, are hand-woven by native workers. Felts are made almost entirely
      by machinery, as are sewed bodies.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="ibod2" id="ibod2"></a>2. Tests of quality</strong>. <em>Straw bodies</em> vary
        in quality with the fineness of the straw used and with the expertness
    of the weaver.</p>
    <p>Among <em>felts</em>, the better grades are fine and close and need
        little sizing. The cheaper felts are loose and coarse. A great deal of
        sizing is used to
    give them body.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="ibod3" id="ibod3"></a>3. Varieties.</strong> <em>Felts</em> are made of a wool or wool and cotton
        composition, which is subjected to beating, heating, and pressure processes.
        The felt composition
      is rolled out into sheets. Body hats are blocked from sheets of felt with
      specially made steel machines. Felt manufactures form extensive industries
      in France, Switzerland, Germany, and Belgium. The finest felts are made
    in France and Switzerland.</p>
    <p><em>Beaver</em> and <em>velour</em> hats are made of felts which
        use the fur of rabbit, beaver, and raccoon in their composition. For
      beaver finish fine furs are drawn through
    the felt by an electric process. </p>
    <p>The finest grade of velours and felts
      is made in Switzerland.</p>
    <p><em>Leghorn</em> hats are woven by hand in Leghorn, Italy.
        A very fine, bearded-wheat straw is used. The town gives the hat its
      name. Straw weaving is the principal
      industry. The finer the straw and the smoother the weaving, the better
      the grade of hat. Children start with coarse weaving and work up to the
      better
      grade as they grow older. The straw is woven into braid strips and these
    are woven into hats.</p>
    <p><em>Tuscan</em> is a very finely woven, golden, natural-straw-colored
        braid, usually made in lace-like patterns. It is sometimes woven into
      body hats and sometimes
    into braids which are sewn into body hats.</p>
    <p><em>Panama</em> hats are woven by natives
        of Panama, China, Japan, Cuba, and many of the southern islands. A fine
        grass is used. The weaving is done under
      water. Women's hats are sized and pressed into various shapes. They are
    used mainly for sport hats.</p>
    <p><em>Sewed bodies</em> are straw braids sewed by machine
        to form soft hats mainly used for sport wear. Hemp braid is sewn with
      angora yarn or visca straw outlining
      the seams. Yarn braids are sewn with silk strips or folds. Felt is cut
      with a pinking machine and sewn like a braid. Silk folds are sewn up into
      soft
      body hats on a box machine which gives the effect of handwork. They make
      lovely sport hats.</p>
    <h4><a name="itrim" id="itrim"></a>TRIMMINGS</h4>
    <p><strong><a name="itrim1" id="itrim1"></a>1. Tests of quality</strong>. Tests of quality vary with the trimming.
        Finish, shape, fabric, quality, and good construction are the most important
        points. Where
      special points are important, they are given with the article.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="itrim2" id="itrim2"></a>2. Varieties.</strong>      <em>Feathers</em> may be roughly divided into two classes:</p>
    <p><em>a.</em> Those used in their
        natural state. Ostrich, pheasant, many quills, and aigrettes are dyed
      but are often used without further change. The plumage of the male ostrich
      is of better quality than that of the female.
    The feathers of the male have larger, longer, and more glossy fiber.</p>
    <p><em>b</em>. Those
        made into fancies. Under this head come feathers that are mounted into
        wing shapes, and bird and fowl feathers that are glycerined, dyed, and
      mounted in fancy shapes and bands, such as peacock, ostrich, and goose.</p>
    <p><em>Flowers</em>.
      The best flowers are made of linen, fine satin, silk, and velvet.</p>
    <p>Cheaper
        flowers are made from coarse cotton. Careful attention should be given
    to the color effects and glue construction, when choosing flowers.</p>
    <p><em>Embroideries</em>.
        Chinese and much peasant embroidery come already made and ready to be
      appliqu&eacute;d on fabric and straw-cloth hats. Many fabric and cloth hats
    are trimmed with hand embroidery.</p>
    <p><em>Ribbons</em>. Ribbons are measured by the number
        of lignes in their width. For example, No. 9 ribbon has nine lignes,
      No. 12 has twelve lignes. Ribbon is
      used for tailored trimming, for binding, for finishes, and for handmade
      flowers and embroidery.</p>
    <p>The varieties are grosgrain, satin, cire, tinsel,
        taffeta, silk fiber, and velvet. Each variety has hundreds of variations
    and patterns.</p>
    <p><em>Ornaments</em>. Ornaments come in many different shapes and forms.
        They are made of metal, celluloid, composition, glass, jet, and straw.
        They are used mainly
      on tailored hats and draped dress hats.</p>
    <p><em>Pins</em>. Pins are made of pearl, brass,
        gold, jade, platinum, rhinestone, jet, and glass. They are used on many
      different hats, usually as a finish.</p>
    <p><em>Handwork</em>. Handwork trims many street
        and dress hats. Under this heading come embroidery, braiding, beading,
        ribbon work, appliqu&eacute;, and cutwork.</p>
    <h4><a name="iframe" id="iframe"></a>FRAMES</h4>

    <p><strong><a name="iframe2" id="iframe2"></a>2. Varieties.</strong> The varieties used are <em>wire, willow,
        net,</em> and <em>buckram</em>.</p>
    <h4><a name="ifind" id="ifind"></a>FINDINGS</h4>
    <p><strong><a name="ifind1" id="ifind1"></a>1. Covering. </strong>Covering or interlining is used under many satins,
      cr&ecirc;pes, silks, and straws.</p>
    <p><em>Mull</em> is a lightweight cotton material with a
      close weave and smooth finish.</p>
    <p><em>Crinoline</em> is used as an interlining where
    body is desired. It is also cut on the bias and used for frame bindings.</p>
    <p><em>Cotton
        flannel</em> is the best interlining for fabric hats and soft fabric crowns.
      It gives a much softer finish to the hat than a thinner covering.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="ifind2" id="ifind2"></a>2. Wire.</strong></p>
    <p><em>Steel wire</em> is a heavy, sprung-steel wire covered or uncovered,
        which is used for edge wires on sailor brims or mushroom brims. It comes
        both in a round
      and square finish.</p>
    <p><em>Cable wire</em> is a fine steel wire covered with a padding
        and silk wrapping. It is used mainly for trimming braces and in machine
      work.</p>
    <p><em>Brace wire</em> is more used than any other one wire. It is a silk-wrapped,
        medium-fine wire which is very firm. It is used for wiring frames and
      for facing edges.</p>
    <p><em>French wire</em> is much like brace wire but is finer and not
        so stiff. It is largely used for wire-edge finishes and for many soft
      hats.</p>
    <p><em>Lace wire</em> is a very fine, silk-wrapped wire used for wiring lace,
    ribbon bows, and for very soft sport and children's hats.</p>
    <p><em>Wire joiners</em>      are tiny steel cylinders used for joining the ends of steel-edge wires
        and facing wires. When wire ends are slipped into this joiner and the
      joiners are clamped with wire cutters, there is no chance of the wire ends
      slipping. A facing edge is much more finished looking when these are used.      </p>
    <p><strong><a name="ifind3" id="ifind3"></a>3. Threads.</strong></p>
    <p><em>Geneva thread</em> is a strong, smooth, cotton thread with a mercerized
        finish. It is well adapted to frame wiring and to all millinery sewing
    except finishes.</p>
    <p><em>Sewing silk</em> for millinery varies little from that used
        for dressmaking. The best grade is much stronger and better to use because
        there are fewer breaks
      and fewer knots to hide.</p>
    <p><em>Embroidery threads</em> are <em>silk, tinsel, yarn,</em> and
        <em>fiber</em>. Usually they are heavier than those used for other embroideries.      </p>
    <p><strong><a name="ifind4" id="ifind4"></a>4. Liquid preparations.</strong></p>
    <p><em>Millinery glue</em> has a great deal of dryer in it
      because it is chiefly used on velvets and satins which must not mar.</p>
    <p><em>Shellac</em>      is a finish used on lis&egrave;re and other fine, shining straws to restore
      their lustre after the braid has been sized or soaked.</p>
    <p><em>Gilt</em> and <em>silver</em> preparations

    <p><strong><a name="ifind5" id="ifind5"></a>5. Needles.</strong></p>
    <p><em>Embroidery needles</em> with
        long eyes rounded at the ends are best for millinery purposes. <em>Crewel</em>      and <em>chenille</em> needles are good because the eyes make large
      holes so that the fabric is not torn by the embroidery thread.</p>
    <p><em>For sewing
        braids</em> ordinary milliner's needles (a long, strong needle with a large
      eye) Nos. 4, 5, and 6 are used.</p>
    <p><em>For fine work</em> as for edge finishes and
      slip-stitching, Nos. 7 and 8 milliner's needles are best.</p>
    <p><em>For frame work</em>      Nos. 4 and 5 milliner's needles are best adapted.</p>
    <p><em>For sewing fabric on
      a frame</em> Nos. 4 and 5 milliner's needles are used.</p>
    <p><em>For trimming</em> no needle
        is so satisfactory as a No. 4 milliner's needle.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI&#8212;CUTTING MATERIALS</h2>
    <h3><a name="i" id="i"></a>I. CUTTING A TRUE BIAS </h3>
    <h4><strong><a href="illust/026.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,436);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/026-t.jpg" alt="Figure 26" width="140" height="202" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong><a name="itb" id="itb"></a>HOW TO OBTAIN A TRUE BIAS</h4>
    <p>To cut a true bias lay
        the length of material flat on the table. Turn the selvage (the warp)
      of one side back over onto the material even with the
      cross thread (the woof). When this turned selvage forms a right angle with
      the lengthwise selvage, the fold or bias is a true bias and correct for
      cutting.</p>
    <p>In other words, a true bias is the hypotenuse of a right triangle,
        the other two sides of which are formed by the warp and woof thread of
        the material.</p>
    <h6><strong>Figure 26. True Bias A C.</strong></h6>
    <h4><a name="iwhen" id="iwhen"></a>WHEN A TRUE BIAS IS NECESSARY</h4>
    <p>An absolutely true bias is necessary when
          material is to be stretched and fitted on a frame as for a bias flange
          (see <a href="m-07.html#ii">Chapter VII, section II</a>), a bias-stretched
      fold, a fitted side crown, a milliner's fold.</p>
    <h4><a name="iimp" id="iimp"></a>IMPORTANCE OF STRETCHING </h4>
    <p>The fullness at the inner edge (inner circumference)
          of a bias flange or fold can be worked out only in exact proportion
      to the amount of stretching
        done to the outer edge of the flange or fold. The more fullness that
      is stretched out of the edge the less there will be to work out on the
      inner
      circumference.</p>
    <h4><a name="imat" id="imat"></a>MATCHING SEAMS</h4>
    <p>Seams on a stretched bias must always run with the warp
        or selvage. To make a seam on the cross threads or woof is to have a
      lumpy-looking seam because
      the seam stitching runs counter to the heavier warp threads. On striped
      or figured materials the pattern may be made to match just as on a straight
    seam.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="i1" id="i1"></a>1. Seam placement.</strong> In hats all seams should come at the back unless
        they will be hidden by trimming. When two seams are required (as for
      velvet folds
      or flanges on a large-brim edge), place one on each side of the back. Keep
    them far enough apart so that the extra length does not look like a patch.</p>
    <h4><a name="icut" id="icut"></a>TO
      CUT A CORRECT BIAS ON LYONS VELVET</h4>
    <p> In draping hats it is important that
        bias run the same way. The following rule has been evolved and is uniformly
        observed by careful workers.</p>
    <p><strong>Rule:</strong> Place the velvet flat on a table in
        front of you so that the nap is rough to the left. In turning the bias
      throw the selvage from you.</p>
    <h3><a name="ii" id="ii"></a>II. CUTTING A LONG BIAS</h3>
    <h4> <strong><a href="illust/027.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,470);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/027-t.jpg" alt="Figure 27" width="150" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong><a name="iilong" id="iilong"></a>PROCESS OF CUTTING
      A LONG BIAS</h4>
    <p>When cutting a long bias the selvage edge is turned across
        the material on a long slant forming an obtuse angle with the selvage
      sides. This gives a
      much longer bias length (see Figure 27).</p>
    <h6><strong>Figure 27. Long Bias A C.</strong></h6>
    <h4><a name="iireq" id="iireq"></a>WHEN A LONG BIAS IS REQUIRED</h4>
    <p>Material, especially Lyons velvet and soleil,
        is cut on a long bias in order to avoid a piecing when the bias is used
        to cover a brim plain or in a puff.
      A long bias is often an advantage in a drape.</p>
    <h3><a name="iii" id="iii"></a>III. TABLE OF BIAS MEASURES</h3>
    <p>The measurement given may be on the selvage
        or through the strip of bias. Always note which measure is given. The
      following table is of help in determining
      the amount of material necessary for a hat.</p>
    <p>6 inches on the selvage of a
      bias = 4&frac12; inches through the bias.</p>
    <p>9 inches on the selvage of a bias
      = 6&frac14; inches through the bias.</p>
    <p>10 inches on the selvage of a bias =
      7&frac14; inches through the bias.</p>
    <p>12 inches on the selvage of a bias = 8&frac12; inches through the bias.</p>
    <p>18 inches on the selvage of a bias = 13&frac14;
      inches through the bias.</p>
    <p>24 inches on the selvage of a bias = 18 inches
        through the bias.</p>
    <h3><a name="iv" id="iv"></a>IV. RULES FOR MEASURING MATERIAL FOR A BIAS WHICH IS TO BE STRETCHED </h3>
    <h4><a name="ivfold" id="ivfold"></a>FOLDS</h4>
    <p> In measuring the length of either bias flange or fold, stretch the bias
    strip (with correct width measure as given below) tightly around the edge
      of the
      hat and allow one-half inch on each end for a seam. </p>
    <p>Stretch and pin the
        material to the form as it will be when finished. That is, down the center
    lengthwise for a fold; on one edge for a flange.</p>
    <p>In measuring for a stretched
        bias fold of not more than one and one-half inches finished, allow three
        quarters of an inch to be taken up in stretching
      and one inch for turning under the edges. That is, one and three-quarters
      inches in all.</p>
    <p>For a fold more than one and one-half inches, allow one-half
        inch more stretch for each inch added in width.</p>
    <h4><a name="ivflang" id="ivflang"></a>FLANGES</h4>
    <p>In measuring for a stretched bias flange of not more than one and
      one-quarter inches when finished, allow five eighths of an inch to be taken
      up in the stretching and one inch for turning under the edges. That is,
      one and five-eighths inches in all. </p>
    <p>For a flange of more than one and one-quarter
      inches when finished, allow three quarters of an inch for stretch&#8212;one
    and three-quarters inches in all.</p>
    <h3><a name="v" id="v"></a>V. CORRECT SHADING FOR VELVET AND SOLEIL</h3>
    <p> To shade correctly on a fitted hat, velvet or soleil should have the
          corner or bias of the material at the front
          and be rough from the face. This is only because the pile is long and
        has depth of color. When placed in this way the darker and more becoming
        shade
        is next the face.</p>
    <h3><a name="vi" id="vi"></a>VI. MEASURING A FRAME FOR THE CORRECT AMOUNT OF MATERIAL</h3>
    <p>This may be done
        by measuring and computing the amount with a tape measure, or by cutting
        paper patterns and placing them accurately on a strip of material
      the width of that to be used, and measuring the strip.</p>
    <h3><a name="vii" id="vii"></a>VII. ACCURACY IN
    CUTTING, A LARGE FACTOR IN COST SAVING</h3>
    <h4><a name="viifirst" id="viifirst"></a>A PAPER PATTERN TO BE MADE FIRST</h4>
    <p>This prevents mistakes in cutting, because all that is experimental about
          the fitting is worked out on paper. From the
        paper patterns may be measured the exact amount of material needed. In
        using expensive fabrics inches saved means dollars saved in cost.</p>
    <h4><a name="viitwo" id="viitwo"></a>CORRECT
      PLACING OF PATTERNS IMPORTANT IN TWO WAYS </h4>
    <p><strong><a name="vii1" id="vii1"></a>1. Correct results.</strong> The paper
        patterns should be so placed on the material that a bias comes in the
        front on a brim, so that the crown material shades the same way as the
        brim in front when velvet or satin is used.</p>
    <p>A bias side crown can shade
        the same, way in only one place because the entire side crown runs one
    way. This one place should be the front.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="vii2" id="vii2"></a>2. Greatest economy of materials.</strong>      By proper placing of the pattern a great deal of material may be saved.
        Because of the swing of the brim in fitting,
      one pattern may be made to fit into the curve of the other. If the material
      is merely fitted on the brim without making patterns, this advantage is
      lost.</p>
    <h3><a name="viii" id="viii"></a>VIII. METHODS USED FOR CUTTING MALINE</h3>
    <p>Because maline is merely a series
      of holes or cells, different methods are used for cutting.</p>
    <h4><a name="viiifold" id="viiifold"></a>MALINE USED FOR
    FOLDS</h4>
    <p>For <strong>folds</strong> maline is cut on the straight lengthwise. This avoids
        the use of more than one seam. A bias is not needed, for the open mesh
        allows for all
      the give necessary. A bias would warp out of shape and stretch to a string.</p>
    <h4><a name="viiipleat" id="viiipleat"></a>MALINE
    USED FOR PLEATINGS</h4>
    <p>For <strong>pleatings</strong> where much cutting is to be done have
        the material folded once, as it comes, and pin it up to a 10- or 12-inch
        length. Pin flat on the center
      fold and smooth out all fullness or wrinkles. Then cut the strips for pleatings.
      Take out the pins and separate the strips.</p>
    <p>For a trimming of pleatings the
        maline should be folded over.</p>
    <p>For a brim-pleated ruffle maline is usually cut into three strips and each
    strip folded double before pleating. The original center fold of maline makes
    the fold of one strip.</p>
    <p>For a side-crown trimming of many rows or pleated rosettes maline is ordinarily
    cut into six strips. Each strip is folded over before pleating into a dovetail
    rosette. This is then sewed to the side crown on a rosette foundation.    </p>
    <h4><a name="viiirose" id="viiirose"></a>MALINE USED FOR ROSETTES</h4>
    <p>For <strong>large rosettes</strong> the full width of maline is often sewed in close loops
    to a twisted length of cable wire or a tab. The loops must be very close
    and sewed on both sides of the foundation.</p>
   <p> The loops are then spread out the full width and clipped all around with
    sharp scissors. This gives a ball-like rosette.</p>
   <h4> <a name="viiibow" id="viiibow"></a>MALINE USED FOR BOWS</h4>
   <p>  For <strong>bows</strong> of maline the full width should be folded and made over a foundation
    form of cable wire. The wire may be looped in a regular bow effect (like
    a lover's-knot bow) and the maline tacked over it.</p>
   <p> Always use soft, loose knots in maline bows.</p>
  <p>  Always handle maline as little as possible. Handling crushes it.
</p><p> Always use a moderately hot iron. Too hot an iron melts the sizing and tears
    the mesh of the maline.</p>
  <h3>  <a name="ix" id="ix"></a>IX. CUTTING BIAS BINDING FOR FRAME AND CROWN EDGES</h3>
  <h4> <a name="ixtime" id="ixtime"></a>ECONOMY OF TIME</h4>
  <p>   <strong>Economy of time in cutting</strong> is an important item in a large workroom. When
    the correct method is used, one girl can cut enough crinoline or mull to
    last for weeks, in a few minutes. Cut a bias corner from the length of binding
    material. Fold back five inches of material lengthwise (on the bias edge).
    Turn this again and again until the full width is folded. This will give
    all the bias edge folded together in one space of five inches. Fold and flatten
    the entire length of material, which may be five or six yards long. Place
    pins at intervals of a few inches. The selvage will wind in a bias slant
    around the fold. With a sharp pair of scissors cut one-inch strips from the
    top, folded, bias edge.</p>
  <p>  The best materials for frame and crown edges are crinoline, cotton, mull,
    or lightweight muslin. When the entire amount of binding is cut, wind it
    into flat rolls ready for use. Before binding an edge always stretch each
    bias strip so that there is no slack in it. This gives a smoother surface.</p>

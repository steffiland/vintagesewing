<h2>  CHAPTER III&#8212;PATTERN FRAMES</h2>
<h3><a name="i" id="i"></a>I. CLASSIFICATION OF FRAMES MADE FROM PATTERNS</h3>
    <p>Since a pattern can represent
        only a flat surface, patterns can be made only for hats that have straight
        lines. The use of seams allows a frame to droop
      or to turn straight up from the headsize. A curved mushroom or an up-turned
      brim with an irregular curve must be stretched over a wire frame.</p>
    <p>Any curves
        made in the shape of pattern brims are accomplished by thimbling or by
        the use of bias-frame material.</p>
    <h4><a name="is" id="is"></a>STRAIGHT BRIMS</h4>
    <p><strong>Straight brims may be divided into three classes,</strong> mushroom,
    sailor, and bias turban brims.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="i1" id="i1"></a>1. Mushroom brims</strong> are brims that droop from
        the headsize down. The degree of droop, or mushroom, varies with the
      styles of the times and with the size
    of the hat.</p>
    <p>The angle of the droop of a small mushroom brim may be much
        greater than that of a large brim. This is because a wide brim with a
      great deal of droop
      would entirely obscure the face.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="i2" id="i2"></a>2. Sailor brims</strong> are either perfectly straight flat brims or slightly mushroom.
    In either case a sprung steel wire is necessary for a large brim. This holds
    the edge firmly without springing out of shape.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="i3" id="i3"></a>3. Bias turban brims</strong>. A<strong><a href="illust/015.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,448);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/015-t.jpg" alt="Figure 15" width="141" height="208" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong> bias strip of elastic net or willow is often used
    to form the coronet of a turban. Usually such a frame has a headsize turn;
    that is, it is turned up at the headsize but not thimbled and has a flare
    at the brim edge. The measurements for headsize turn and the brim edge are
    given with the pattern (see Figure 15).</p>
    <h4 class="clear"><a name="ir" id="ir"></a>ROLLED BRIMS</h4>
    <p><strong><a name="ir1" id="ir1"></a>1. Thimbled rolls.</strong> All of the up-turned brims and brims with turned-up edges which are given in a pattern design have a roll that is made by thimbling (see Figure 16).</p>
    <p><em><strong><a href="illust/016.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',616,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/016-t.jpg" alt="Figure 16" width="200" height="143" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>Thimbling a roll.</em> To make the roll in a frame, hold the outside of the frame
    in the palm of the left hand and rub the inside with the thimble on the thimble
    finger of the right hand.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="ir2" id="ir2"></a>2. Headsize rolls</strong> are usually directly at the headsize so that the brim
    turns up from the face. Ordinarily an extra wire is not needed.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="ir3" id="ir3"></a>3. Facing
        rolls</strong> are often an inch or more from the headsize, in which case
      a wire is used and measurement is given for it.</p>
    <p>Often rolls are at the back,
        others are at the front or side. An extra brace is seldom used except
    for very large brims.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="ir4" id="ir4"></a>4. Edge rolls. </strong>Edge rolls may be a very slight shaping
        of the frame or may be an extra bias strip added. In some cases this
      is a fold of elastic net
      added after the frame is wired.</p>
    <p>In other cases a pencil roll is used. For
        this finish, the frame has a thick pencil-like roll on the edge. One
      edge of a bias strip is sewn to the wired edge of a brim. The other edge
      of the bias strip is rolled up over the top of the brim and wired with
      a circle of wire slightly
    larger than the brim edge wire. Measurements for this wire are always given
    on the pattern, as the roll varies from one inch to three inches.</p>
    <h3><a name="ii" id="ii"></a>II. COMPARISON
      OF PROCESSES IN MAKING UNROLLED AND ROLLED BRIMS</h3>
    <p>In making a straight unrolled brim the headsize is wired first,
      then the edge is wired.</p>
    <p>In making a rolled brim the headsize is wired first,
      then the roll is thimbled and wired if necessary. The edge is wired last.</p>
    <h3><a name="iii" id="iii"></a>III.
      CUTTING THE FRAME</h3>
    <h4> <a name="iiipl" id="iiipl"></a>PLACING OF PATTERN</h4>
    <p>Always place the pattern so that
      the center front is at the bias corner of the material.</p>
    <p>When willow is
        used, place the pattern on the frame material so that the rough side
    is the top of the frame. The cloth side is then on the under side.</p>
    <p>When
        the headsize is slashed and the slashes bent up, the slashes are held
      up by the cloth and do not break off as they would if the smooth side were
      on top.</p>
    <p>When the brim is rolled, the smooth cloth side of the willow holds
        the curve better than the fiber side.</p>
    <h4><a name="iiiob" id="iiiob"></a>OBTAINING CORRECT HEADSIZE</h4>
    <p>Measure a correct headsize by slipping frame wire around the head where
      the hat is worn. Hold the end of the wire firmly, so that the measured
      circle cannot slip. Allow two and one-half inches for lapping,
    and cut the wire. Tie the ends down with short lengths of tie wire, or wrap
    strong thread firmly over each end and sew through the silk wrapping of the
    wires.</p>
    <p>Shape the wire circle thus formed into an ellipse and slip inside the
      frame above the slashes on the line marked &quot;headsize wire.&quot; If
      the headsize is larger than the average, the wire will come below the line;
      if smaller,
    the headsize wire will come above the headsize line. Sew this wire to the
      headsize line with a blanket stitch (see <a href="#fig19">Figure 19</a>). Patterns are made
      the average head-size, which is 23 to
    25 inches.</p>
    <h4><a name="iiiad" id="iiiad"></a>ADJUSTING SEAMS</h4>
    <p>Frame seam allowances are always made on the patterns.
        To make a frame headsize smaller or larger, always make an extra seam
      in the front if there is a difference
      of more than &frac34; inch desired in the headsize. To take more than &frac34; inch
    out or to add more than &frac34; inch at one place spoils the line of the hat.</p>
    <h4><a name="iiiim" id="iiiim"></a>IMPORTANCE
    OF TRUE-EDGE OUTLINES </h4>
    <p>A true-edge outline is no mere matter of chance.
          It is a geometrical thing. The outline of a hat frame must be absolutely
      true in curve or angle. An angle is always decided&#8212;not accidental-looking.</p>
    <p>An
        edge of a hat must be always one of two things; a perfect ellipse, or
      an ellipse with a definite irregularity added in a turned curve or a decided
      angle.</p>
    <p>Always trim an edge carefully before wiring it. Try to train the
      eye to see curves in absolutely correct perspective.</p>
    <h3><a name="iv" id="iv"></a>IV. WIRING FRAMES    </h3>
    <h4><a name="ivd" id="ivd"></a>DIFFERENT KINDS OF WIRE</h4>
    <p><strong><a name="iv1" id="iv1"></a>1. Brace wire</strong> is more commonly and widely used
        than any other one wire. For frame wiring, for wire frames, and for edge-wire
        finishes it is very satisfactory
      and especially so for student work (see <a href="m-05.html#i">Chapter V,
      section I</a>).</p>
    <p><strong><a name="iv2" id="iv2"></a>2. Lace wire</strong>      is used for wiring soft frames for sport hats, and for children's hats,
      and for lace bows and edges.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="iv3" id="iv3"></a>3. French wire</strong> is used for wiring frames
        and for edge wires. It makes a less stiff hat than brace wire does (see
      <a href="m-05.html#i">Chapter V, section I</a>).</p>
    <p><strong><a name="iv4" id="iv4"></a>4. Cable wire</strong> is used for frames only when a thick-edge
        effect is desired.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="iv5" id="iv5"></a>5. Ribbon wire</strong> is used to wire frame edge when a fold effect is desired,
    and for headsize bands.</p>
    <p><strong><a href="illust/017.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,452);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/017-t.jpg" alt="Figure 17" width="158" height="220" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>It is sometimes used as a cording over which fabric
        or ribbon is shirred. In such cases it forms the only frame used. Measurements
        and directions are
      given on the pattern for this type of hat (see Figure 17).</p>
    <h6><strong>Figure 17. Hat Made on Ribbon Wire for the Frame.</strong></h6>
    <h4 class="clear"><a name="ivsp" id="ivsp"></a>SPECIAL USES
      OF THESE WIRES</h4>
    <p><strong><a name="ivsp1" id="ivsp1"></a>1. Cable wire</strong> and <strong>French wire</strong> may be used for the same
      purposes. The former simply makes a firmer hat.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="ivsp2" id="ivsp2"></a>2. Lace wire</strong> is needed
        for wiring high lace ruffles and for lace or hair-braid edges and for
      lace flowers.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="ivsp3" id="ivsp3"></a>3. French wire</strong> is needed for frames and finished edges where
        soft effects are desired.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="ivsp4" id="ivsp4"></a>4. Cable wire</strong> is used for only a few edges.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="ivsp5" id="ivsp5"></a>5. Ribbon wire</strong> is much used
    for soft, fold frame edges and for headsize-band finishes.</p>
    <h4><a name="ivpoi" id="ivpoi"></a>POINTS OF IMPORTANCE
      IN WIRING FRAMES </h4>
    <p>The wire must always have the curve worked out before
          it is sewed to the frame. Straighten the wire by running
        the thumb and forefinger over it lengthwise, using the cushion part of
        the thumb and finger, not the tip. If the tips of the thumb and finger
        are
        used, they bend the wire instead of straightening it.</p>
    <p>The wire must be sewn
        at the edge above or below. It cannot be directly on the edge. There
      is nothing to hold it, and the wire slips.</p>
    <h4><a name="ivsti" id="ivsti"></a>STITCHES USED</h4>
    <p><strong><a name="ivst1" id="ivst1"></a><a name="fig18" id="fig18"></a><a name="fig19" id="fig19"></a>1.</strong> A <strong>blanket stitch</strong> is<strong><a href="illust/019.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',455,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/019-t.jpg" alt="Figure 19" width="220" height="120" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong> used <strong><a href="illust/018.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',579,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/018-t.jpg" alt="Figure 18" width="180" height="126" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>for sewing the headsize wire
        to the frame, for wiring the edge of a brim, and for sewing on the wire
        at a roll. For this
      the needle must be stuck through the frame and pushed back to catch the
      thread knot (see figures 18 and 19).</p>
    <h6><strong>Figure 18. Wiring the Frame. </strong></h6>
    <h6><strong>Figure 19. The Back Stitch. The Blanket Stitch.</strong></h6>
    <p><strong><a name="ivst2" id="ivst2"></a>2.</strong> A <strong>backstitch</strong> is used for sewing
      a headsize band to the slashes of the headsize (see Figure 19, A).</p>
    <h3 class="clear"><a name="v" id="v"></a>V.
    BINDING A FRAME</h3>
    <p><strong><a href="illust/020.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',372,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/020-t.jpg" alt="Figure 20" width="220" height="97" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>In binding a frame edge, bias crinoline is used for a
        flat edge (see <a href="m-06.html#ix">Chapter VI, section IX</a>). The crinoline should be stretched
        lengthwise and sewed flat
      on the frame with running stitches half an inch long.</p>
    <p>Always have the binding
        about an inch wide after stretching. Sew the binding at its edge. The
      object is to protect the hat covering from being marred or worn by the
      edge wire. A binding should be sewn so as to blur the wire, not emphasize
    it.</p>
    <h3><a name="vi" id="vi"></a>VI. COVERING FRAME WITH INTERLINING</h3>
    <p> An interlining is needed to keep
          the frame from showing through straw braid or fabric and to give an
      appearance of softness to a hat. Satin without an interlining makes a hard-looking
    hat.</p>
    <h4><a name="vik" id="vik"></a>KINDS OF INTERLINING AND THEIR USES </h4>
    <p>The <strong>fabrics</strong> most used for interlinings
    are cotton flannel, mull, and silkoline.</p>
    <p><em>Cotton flannel</em> is soft, thick,
      and lightweight. It is preferable
    except when a thin fabric is used for the hat, and a matching color in interlining
    is needed.</p>
    <p>For colored georgette, lightweight colored cr&ecirc;pes, and thin, dark-colored
    satin or messaline, <em>mull</em>, or <em>silkoline</em> in matching shades is used for interlinings.</p>
    <p>Thin
        black satin or messaline needs a <em>self-colored interlining</em> only, because
    the white interlining shows at the needle points in the edge-wire finish.</p>
    <p>For
        very light-colored georgette, as flesh, primrose, or orchid, <em>white
      cotton flannel</em> is preferable to a thinner material of a self color because
      it gives a more spongy, soft effect to the cr&ecirc;pe. A thin, closely woven
      interlining
      often gives cr&ecirc;pe a hard surface.</p>
    <h4><a name="vist" id="vist"></a>STITCHES USED</h4>
    <p>As a general rule the same stitches are used for an interlining
        as for the outer fabric. A frame is covered as though silk or velvet
      were used.</p>
    <p>In covering a frame with interlining for a braid hat, the edge
    stitches need not be carefully done because the braid hides them.</p>
    <p>An interlining
        for a fabric underfacing is sewn separately at the headsize, but interlining
        and facing are turned over the facing wire together. If they
      are turned separately, the cr&ecirc;pe or silk edge shows in an ugly edge outline.
      The facing and the wire are apt to show through the fabric.</p>
    <h4><a name="vief" id="vief"></a>EFFECTS TO BE
      OBTAINED</h4>
    <p>The effects desired in the use of interlinings are to soften
        the hat effect, and to keep the frame from showing through the straw
      braid or fabric.</p>
    <p>Interlining can never be close, heavy material, or it will
      tend to make a heavy hat.</p>
    <p>The quality of lightness in a hat is just as
        important as beauty and becomingness are.</p>

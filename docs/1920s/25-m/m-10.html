<h2>CHAPTER X&#8212;DRAPED HATS</h2>
    
    <h3><a name="i" id="i"></a>I. MATRONS' TURBANS</h3>
    <h4> <a name="icut" id="icut"></a>CUTTING OF MATERIALS</h4>
    <p><strong><a name="icut1" id="icut1"></a>1. Materials.</strong> Materials used for matrons' draped hats are usually velvets,
    satin soleils, satins, duvetyns, heavy faille, taffeta, moire silks, ribbon,
    straw cloths, and some straw and hair braids.</p>
    
    <p>For <em>folded drapes</em> velvet, duvetyn, satin soleil, moire&quot; satin, and
      straw cloth are good fabrics.</p>
    
    <p>Hat braid and some visca and satin-straw braids are sewed into wide strips
    and used for folded drapes.</p>
    
    <p>For <em>shirred, draped turbans</em> satin soleils, faille, moire, and heavy taffetas
    are good fabrics. These fancy fabrics may be used for the shirred parts in
    combination with velvet, duvetyn, or satin braid for the fitted or unshirred
    part of the turban.</p>
    
    <p>For shirring fabric may be straight, bias, or shaped. A pattern for the shape,
    or dimensions for cutting are always given on a hat pattern.</p>
    <p><strong><em><a href="illust/053.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',532,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/053-t.jpg" alt="Figure 53" width="167" height="167" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em></strong>For <em>rosette effects</em> velvet, satin soleil, ribbon, taffeta, moire,
      or faille
      may be used. These fabrics may be combined with other fabrics or straw
    braid or straw cloth.</p>
    <h6><strong>Figure 53. Making a Roll at the Headsize of the Crown for a Turban
        Foundation.</strong></h6>
    <h4 class="clear"><a name="icomb" id="icomb"></a>COMBINATION OF MATERIALS</h4>
    
    <p>Almost without exception a combination of materials with different finishes
    makes a more effective draped hat than a use of one material only. The materials
    may be of the same or contrasting colors. Below are listed a few good combinations
    for draped turbans:</p>
    
    <dl><dd>Black velvet and black satin soleil.</dd>
    <dd>Black velvet and king's-blue velvet.</dd>
    <dd>Black soleil and copenhagen-blue velvet.</dd>
    <dd>Brown soleil, brown velvet, and sand velvet.</dd>
    <dd>Brown soleil and henna velvet.</dd>
    <dd>Black satin and black hair cloth.</dd>
    <dd>Black moire, Copenhagen moire, and black hair cloth.</dd>
    <dd>King's-blue faille, black faille, and black hair cloth.</dd>
    <dd>Plum satin, navy satin, and navy hair cloth.</dd>
    <dd>Brown faille, sand faille, brown hair braid.</dd>
    <dd>Navy taffeta, rose taffeta, navy straw cloth.</dd>
    <dd>Navy velvet, navy and gold brocade.</dd>
    <dd>Brocade soleil, brocade and gold tinsel cloth.</dd>
    <dd>Copenhagen-blue velvet and blue-and-silver-tinsel cloth. </dd></dl>
	<h4><a name="ismall" id="ismall"></a>USE OF SMALL BRIMS</h4>
    
    <p><strong><em><a href="illust/056.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',240,171);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/056-t.jpg" alt="Figure 56" width="151" height="220" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em></strong>With<strong><em><a href="illust/055.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,478);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/055-t.jpg" alt="Figure 55" width="153" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em></strong> very<strong><em><a href="illust/054.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',410,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/054-t.jpg" alt="Figure 54" width="220" height="116" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em></strong> few exceptions, a small rolled or mushroom brim makes a draped
    turban much more becoming. Very few women past thirty years of age can stand
    a hard forehead line in a hat.</p>
    <h6><strong>Figure 54. Width in a Draped Turban.</strong></h6>
    <h6><strong>Figure 55. Fabric Turban Made of Bows Which Give Irregular Width.</strong></h6>
    <h6><strong>Figure 56. Turban with Side Crown and Rosettes of Petals, Giving
    Width.</strong></h6>
    <h4 class="clear"><a name="iwid" id="iwid"></a>WAYS TO OBTAIN WIDTH</h4>
    
    <p>The placing of shirred rosettes or the side extension of shirred and folded
    drapes may be utilized to give soft width to a turban. This is especially
    necessary when the individual has high, wide cheek bones. Soft width in the
      hat gives better balance to the hat. Both drapes and rosettes may be held
    in place by wired braces.</p>
    <h4><a name="ih" id="ih"></a>WAYS<strong><em><a href="illust/058.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,283);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/058-t.jpg" alt="Figure 58" width="101" height="230" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em></strong> TO<strong><em><a href="illust/057.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',474,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/057-t.jpg" alt="Figure 57" width="220" height="179" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em></strong> OBTAIN HEIGHT</h4>
    
    <p>Where height is desired, rosettes and drapings may be extended above the
    frame crown and held in place by wired braces.</p>
    
    <p>Feathers may add to the line of a drape and give further height.</p>
    <h6><strong>Figure 57. Frame Which Gives Height to Matron's Hat. <span class="small">Note the
        high coronet <em>F</em> which holds up the drape. The brim <em>A</em> is
        rolled across the front and left side, line <em>C-B.</em> This roll to
        the brim and the coronet width at the sides, points <em>S</em>, make
        the perfect formula for a short woman with a full face oval.</span></strong></h6>
    <h6><strong>Figure 58. The Rolled Brim and High Rosette Trim Give Height
    and Lifted Line.</strong></h6>
    <h3 class="clear"><strong><em><a href="illust/059.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',600,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/059-t.jpg" alt="Figure 59" width="220" height="184" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em></strong><a name="ii" id="ii"></a>II. HAREM TURBANS </h3>

        in the bias drape. Point <em>A</em> shows the straight selvage edge.
        Point <em>B</em> shows the lap of the plain material under the brocade.</span></strong></h6>
    <h4 class="clear"><a name="iiv" id="iiv"></a>VARIED MATERIALS USED</h4>
    <p><strong><a name="iiv1" id="iiv1"></a>1. Duvetyn</strong> makes an admirable draped turban for street wear. The pile is
    deep, the colors are good, and the fabric becoming because it gives soft
    effects.</p>
    
    <p><strong><a name="iiv2" id="iiv2"></a>2. Taffeta, </strong>either plain or embroidered, is an excellent fabric for a harem
    turban. It drapes well, comes in good costume colors, and is easily handled.</p>
    
    <p><strong><a name="iiv3" id="iiv3"></a>3. Satin,</strong> because of its high lustre, makes smart tailored hats. The body
    of good satin drapes well. Street shades are best.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="iiv4" id="iiv4"></a>4. Satin ribbon</strong> in street and dressier shades is well adapted for turbans.
    Because of the finished edges it is easily handled in combination with other
    materials.</p>
    
    <p><strong><a name="iiv5" id="iiv5"></a>5. Tinsel cloths</strong> make handsome harem turbans for dressy afternoon and evening
    wear for winter. Colors are good and the fabric well adapted for loosely
    folded drapes.</p>
    
    <p><strong><a name="iiv6" id="iiv6"></a>6. Brocades</strong> make good dress turbans for evening and formal afternoon wear.
    The colors and fabrics are lovely in contrast to the dark tones of fur wraps.</p>
    
    <p><strong><a name="iiv7" id="iiv7"></a>7. Straw cloth </strong>makes stylish
      turbans in combination with celophane or jet for early spring. A rhinestone
      pin gives a smart finish to an all-hair-cloth
    turban. A fabric headsize binding is usually necessary. Haircloth catches
    on to the hair and hair nets.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="iiv8" id="iiv8"></a>8. Maline </strong>makes smart dance turbans and turbans for summer-dress
    and street wear. Jet or rhinestone or fancy, colored ornaments are the usual
    finish. The top may be transparent or may be of fabric.</p>
    
    <p><strong><a name="iiv9" id="iiv9"></a>9. Braids</strong> are sewn into wide stripping and usually combined with maline or
    fabric. A fabric headsize binding is necessary.</p>
    
    <h5><a name="iicut" id="iicut"></a>CUTTING OF MATERIALS</h5>
    
    <p>Fabrics are ordinarily cut on the bias for draping. Usually a circular section
    is used for the top of a harem turban. The drape ends may be pulled in at
    the headsize or folded under one another. For all straw and maline drapes
    the latter method is better. All headsize materials should be smooth in finish.
    Maline and ribbons are, of course, always used on the straight.</p>
    
    <h4><a name="iicombo" id="iicombo"></a>COMBINATIONS OF MATERIALS</h4>
    
    <p>Combinations of material make good dressy effects. A few combinations are
    listed below.</p>
    
    <dl><dd>Black satin, black and silver brocade.</dd>
    <dd>Copenhagen, jade, and rust faille.</dd>
    <dd>Gold, jade, sapphire, rust, and henna maline.</dd>
    <dd>Black maline and black satin.</dd>
    <dd>Brown maline and brown satin.</dd>
    <dd>Brown maline and brown and gold tinsel cloth.</dd>
    <dd>Jade maline and jade and silver tinsel cloth.</dd>
    <dd>Copenhagen and silver brocade and Copenhagen and silver tinsel.</dd>
    <dd>Copenhagen and silver brocade and Copenhagen velvet.</dd>
    <dd>Jade velvet and Chinese embroidery.</dd>
    <dd>Black soleil and Chinese embroidery.</dd>
    <dd>Brown soleil and brown satin and Chinese embroidery.</dd></dl>
    
    <h4><a name="iifr" id="iifr"></a>FRAMES USED</h4>
    <p>Turban frames, pressed or made of bias elastic net, or soft crowns with headsize
    bindings are used for the usual harem turbans. Soft crowns with tiny brims
    and soft crowns with coronets and small brims make becoming variations in
    frame shapes.</p>
    
    <h3><a name="iii" id="iii"></a>III. DRAPED TAMS</h3>
    <h4><a name="iiipat" id="iiipat"></a>PATTERNS</h4>
    
    <p><strong><em><a href="illust/060.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,397);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/060-t.jpg" alt="Figure 60" width="140" height="207" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em></strong>Patterns are always given for the shape of draped tams. </p>
    <h6><strong>Figure 60. High Drape Tam with Small Headsize, Brim, and Some
        Width.</strong></h6>
    <p class="clear"><strong><a name="iiipat1" id="iiipat1"></a>1. Sectional patterns</strong>      always give the method of assembling the sections and for applying any
      design given.</p>
    <p><em>Four-section, draped tams</em> are usually made without any frame other than
    a soft, pressed crown. These make good flapper hats and good foundations
    for embroidery.</p>
    
    <p><em>Six-section, draped hats</em> are made without frames. They are adapted to embroidery
    and come in youthful and in older designs.</p>
    
    <p><em>Eight-section tams</em> are made sometimes on crowns, sometimes without any frame.
    They are usually of fabric, though ribbon and straw cloth are used occasionally.</p>
    
    <p><strong><a name="iiipat2" id="iiipat2"></a>2. Circular patterns</strong> are used for many embroidery fabrics and straw-cloth
    tams. Usually they are beaded, braided, or embroidered.</p>
    
    <p><strong><a name="iiipat3" id="iiipat3"></a>3. Bias tams</strong> are of velvet, taffeta, or cr&ecirc;pe and usually have some width
    added in an extra drape or bow.</p>
    
    <h4><a name="iiitr" id="iiitr"></a>TRIMMING</h4>
    <p><strong><em><a href="illust/061.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,338);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/061-t.jpg" alt="Figure 61" width="122" height="220" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em></strong>Almost all tam trimming is some sort of appliqu&eacute;d flat design.
      A few quills, feathers, and pins are used.</p>
    <h6><strong>Figure 61. Tam Which May Be Braided by Machine or Embroidered
        by Hand.</strong></h6>
    <p class="clear"><strong><a name="iiitr1" id="iiitr1"></a>1. Machine embroidery </strong>has been made a fine art. In the
      larger cities beautiful machine embroidery is done by professional workers.
      These places will furnish
    designs or use those provided by the customers.</p>
    
    <p><strong><a name="iiitr2" id="iiitr2"></a>2. Hand embroidery </strong>can be beautifully done by the home
      milliner. It requires only careful work following the designs given on
      the patterns.</p>
    
    <p><em>Ribbonzene</em> comes in lovely, soft colors and is used to make entire designs
    and in combination with yarn, embroidery floss, tinsel threads, or chenille.</p>
    
    <p><em>Silk embroidery</em> threads occasionally make an entire design, but are generally
    used in combination with something else.</p>
    
    <p><em>Appliqu&eacute; embroidery</em> makes beautiful effects. Patterns for this work are always
    given with the hat patterns.</p>
    
    <p><em>Yarn embroidery</em> is used on fabric and straw cloth. It is often
    used in combination with straw stripping, chenille, and ribbonzene.</p>
    
    <p><strong><a name="iiitr3" id="iiitr3"></a>3. Beading</strong> is an effective trimming for this type of hat.</p>
    
    <p><em>Wooden beads</em> often outline appliqu&eacute;. They come in lovely colors and are best
    used in combination with tinsel, yarn, ribbonzene, or embroidery floss.</p>
    
    <p><em>Bugle beads</em> are used in black, silver, gold, and colors on dressy tams,
    usually in combination with silk floss or tinsel threads.</p>
    
    <p><em>Nail heads</em> are used in white, black, and colors. They are most effective
    when used in solid designs or in combination with bugle beads or embroidery
    threads.</p>
    
    <h4><a name="iiigen" id="iiigen"></a>GENERAL SUGGESTIONS</h4>
    <p><strong><a name="iiigen1" id="iiigen1"></a>1. Points to remember for artistry</strong> in draping tams, are:
      Symmetry of folds. Folds should always be smooth in line, never puckered
    or tight. The general line of the folds should slant in the same or directly
    opposite directions.</p>
    
    <p><em>Tacking of drape. </em>The stitches used for tacking must always be
    hidden. They may be tie tacks or the tacking may be done from inside the
      crown using small stitches on the outside and long ones inside the crown.</p>
    
    <p>Always use the fewest possible number of stitches to secure the drape.</p>
    
    <p><em>Color harmony.</em> Always be careful to choose harmonious colors
      for embroidery colors that blend well. Vivid colors may be used for the
      tam fabric and
    dull colors for the embroidery or the reverse. Never use vivid embroidery
    colors on a very vivid fabric, or dull embroidery colors on dull fabrics.</p>
    
    <p>Self-tone embroidery should be used if a dull effect is desired.</p>
    
    <p><strong><a name="iiigen2" id="iiigen2"></a>2. Points to remember for becomingness.</strong> Draped tams furnish one of the most
    becoming types of hats. The drape may be adjusted to give becoming lines
    for different kinds of faces. Always try on and readjust the drape to suit
    the individual. This makes an excellent class problem.</p>
    
    <p><em>Harmony of line.</em> Becomingness depends greatly upon the degree to which lines
    of the hat harmonize with one's physical lines.</p>
    <p><em>a.</em> Harmony of line with facial contour. The tam must be draped
      so as to preserve a balanced proportion.</p>
    
    <p>A small face must never have a too-heavy drape.</p>
    
    <p>A long face oval needs soft width without length draping.</p>
    
    <p>A wide face oval takes proportionately wide draping.</p>
    <p><em>b. </em>The mode of hairdressing has a great deal to do with the becomingness
    of hats. A large knot of hair in the back needs always to have some brim
    and some drape in the back and at the sides. A plain mode of hairdressing
    needs some brim and a soft drape. A soft, full mode of hairdressing can stand
    plainer and more severe lines in a hat.</p>
    
    <p><em>c. </em>Harmony with costumes. A draped hat must harmonize in style and fabric
    with the costume it is designed for. A draped hat may be worn for street
    or dress, according to the fabric used. Evening fabrics for evening wear,
    street fabrics for street wear is the rule.</p>
    
    <h3><a name="iv" id="iv"></a>IV. SECTION HATS</h3>
    <p>Section hats are hats which receive their form from the fitting together
    of shaped pieces, or sections, of material. The majority of these hats are
    made in pie- or wedge-shaped sections, the apex of the sections forming the
    top center of the crown. Two-section crowns (see <a href="m-07.html#fig31">Figure
    31</a>), six-section
    crowns (see <a href="m-07.html#fig32">Figure 32</a>), and saddle-section
    crowns (see <a href="m-04.html#fig24">Figure
    24</a>) are notable
    exceptions.</p>
    
    <p>Patterns are given for the shapes of section hats.</p>
    <h4><a name="ivvar" id="ivvar"></a>VARIOUS SECTIONAL HATS</h4>
    
    <p><strong><a name="ivvar1" id="ivvar1"></a>1. Two-section hats</strong> usually have a crown or no frame at all; they are used
    for misses and children, being delightfully soft.</p>
    
    <p><strong><a name="ivvar2" id="ivvar2"></a>2. Four-section hats</strong> are made sometimes on a crown, sometimes on a crown
    and brim. Any embroidery or design used is always given with the pattern.
    See <a href="m-15.html#fig103">Figure 103</a> for section hat with crown and brim foundation.</p>
    
    <p><strong><a name="ivvar3" id="ivvar3"></a>3. Six-section hats</strong> are made with or without brim foundation. A crown or
    headsize band is always used. A pin, tassel, or ornament is often the only
    finish. The material is usually fabric. Any embroidery design is always given
    on the pattern.</p>
    
    <p><strong><a name="ivvar4" id="ivvar4"></a>4. Eight-section hats</strong> have the same characteristics as six-section hats (see
    above).</p>
    
    <p><strong><a name="ivvar5" id="ivvar5"></a>5. Saddle-section hats</strong> are very smart for both dress and street wear. Embroidery
    or handmade flowers are the usual trimming. Patterns are always given for
    any handwork.</p>

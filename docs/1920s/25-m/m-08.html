<h2>CHAPTER VIII&#8212;BRAID HATS</h2>
<p>The manufacture of braids for millinery forms an extensive industry
    on the Continent. In the United States most of the industry is confined to
    the eastern
  manufacturing group of states where immigrant labor is used.</p>
<h3><a name="i" id="i"></a>I. KINDS</h3>
<p>There are, of course, more kinds of braids for summer wear than for
  fall and winter. Braid hats for fall are almost invariably for sport wear.</p>
<h4><a name="isb" id="isb"></a>SUMMER
    BRAIDS</h4>
<p><strong><a name="isb1" id="isb1"></a>1. Visca braid.</strong> Visca braid is soft and pliable, well-suited to classroom
  work because it is easily handled.</p>
<p><strong><a name="isb2" id="isb2"></a>2. Satin straw.</strong> Satin straw is woven
    of a composition with such a smooth and shining surface that it has the appearance
    of hard candy.</p>
<p><strong><a name="isb3" id="isb3"></a>3. Hemp braid.</strong> Hemp makes lovely sport hats when combined with
    ribbon. It is very satisfactory for facings in fabric hats for early spring
    and late
    summer as it is smooth and finished-looking.</p>
<p><strong><a name="isb4" id="isb4"></a>4. Milan braid.</strong> Milan braid
    makes some of the smartest of the spring hats. It is an expensive braid both
    from the point of cost of material and of labor,
      but is well worth the cost. The sewing gives interesting construction problems
  for the classroom.</p>
<p><strong><a name="isb5" id="isb5"></a>5. Lis&egrave;re braid.</strong> Lis&egrave;re braid has a harder finish and
    more of a shine than milan braid. For feather-trimmed, tailored hats and
  for celophane and lacquered, plume-trimmed hats it is very handsome. Lis&egrave;re
  stripping
  is used for combination sewing with hair braid.</p>
<p><strong><a name="isb6" id="isb6"></a>6. Tuscan braid.</strong> Tuscan braid
    is used for elaborate sport and lingerie hats. Special patterns are made
  for embroidery use. In these patterns the design
      is practically complete and ready to be applied to hats of straw cloth
  or fabric.</p>
<h4><a name="isport" id="isport"></a>SPORT BRAIDS</h4>
<p><strong><a name="isport1" id="isport1"></a>1. Yarn braid.</strong> Yarn braid comes in plain and mixed colors suitable for sport
    wear. Entire hats are often made of and trimmed with yarn braid.</p>
    <p>Flowers may be made of assorted colors and used on plain-colored hats. For
    example : rust, jade, Copenhagen blue, henna, and dull, purple flowers may
    be used on a sand-colored yarn-braid hat with darker tan-yarn stitching.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="isport2" id="isport2"></a>2. Chenille braid.</strong> Chenille braid comes in more elaborate designs than yarn
    braid. Often a floral pattern in colors is woven in the braid. This makes
    it adaptable for trimming purposes. Other patterns are woven of wired chenille.
    These braids may be sewn without a frame. The body of the braid is sufficient
    to hold them in shape.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="isport3" id="isport3"></a>3. Felt braid.</strong> Felt braid is much used for machine-sewed sport hats. The
    edge of the braid is often cut in a pattern of points and scallops.</p>
    
    <p><strong><a name="isport4" id="isport4"></a>4. Ramie braid</strong> is manufactured from the Malay grass-cloth
    plant. The strong, rough texture makes it a favorite among manufacturers.</p>
    
    <h4><a name="ihair" id="ihair"></a>HAIR BRAID</h4>
    
    <p>Hair braid is much favored for early spring and summer wear. The spring
      hats are sewed on pressed frames over a silk or silkoline covering (or
      interlining). Satin or taffeta is used for crowns or facings.</p>
    
    <p><strong><a name="ihair1" id="ihair1"></a>1. Plain hair.</strong> There are three distinct qualities of plain hair braid.</p>
    
    <p><em>Swiss hair braid</em> is the best quality. It has a lovely lustre, a good fiber,
    and is closely woven.</p>
    
    <p><em>German hair braid</em> has a poorer fiber than Swiss hair. The lustre is metallic
    and the weave, loose and less perfect.</p>
    
    <p><em>Domestic hair braid</em> is the poorest quality. It is limp, coarse, and lustreless.
    Most of the cheap factory-made hair hats are made of this.</p>
    
    <p><strong><a name="ihair2" id="ihair2"></a>2. Hair braids with designs</strong> come in patterns of exquisite texture and workmanship.
    These braids are made in Switzerland and France and are used for garden hats
    and for dressy, all-black hats combined with maline.</p>
    
    <p><em>White hair with designs in natural tuscan</em> has a dainty effect very pretty
    in combination with chiffon, georgette, or lace for lingerie or flower-trimmed
    hats.</p>
    
    <p><em>Designs in visca on hair braid</em> are used on black, brown, sand, and navy hair-braid
    hats suitable for both dress and tailored designs.</p>
    
    <p><em>Designs of satin straw on hair braid</em> come in both street and pastel shades.
    These braids are suitable for plainer dress and street models.</p>
    
    <p><em>Designs of embroidery in raffia straw and silk threads on plain hair</em> come
    in elaborate designs for dressy, tailored, and plainer dress hats.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="ihair3" id="ihair3"></a>3. Hair braid folded by machine </strong>makes soft effects for facing and is used
    for street and semidress hats. Plain hair braid or silk are used in combination
    to prevent the hat from being thick-looking.</p>
    
    <p><strong><a name="ihair4" id="ihair4"></a>4. Hair tubing </strong>comes in many colors and is used for braiding and embroidering
    on plain hair, on silk fabrics, and on straw cloths.</p>
    
    <p><strong><a name="ihair5" id="ihair5"></a>5. Fancy weaves of hair braid </strong>(that is, hair braid woven
      in scallops and irregular patterns) come in a variety of designs suitable
      for both dress
    and tailored models.</p>
    
    <h3><a name="ii" id="ii"></a>II. MANNER OF SEWING</h3>
    
    <p>The manner of sewing braid varies, but the simplest and most effective methods
    are the ones given.</p>
    
    <h4><a name="iicr" id="iicr"></a>CROWNS</h4>
    
    <p>Crowns may be sewn in the hand while shaping them into tam or round crowns.
    In this method the eye must be well trained. The most satisfactory methods
    for students are:</p>
    
    <p><strong><a name="iicr1" id="iicr1"></a>1. Molding a soft crown over a wooden or buckram block.</strong> Wooden
      molds are an advantage because they may be used for steaming crowns into
      shape. Buckram
    crowns will serve as molds for braid sewing but soften with the use of steam.</p>
    
    <p>In sewing<em><strong><a href="illust/043.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,610);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/043-t.jpg" alt="Figure 43" width="172" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em> a<em><strong><a href="illust/042.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,584);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/042-t.jpg" alt="Figure 42" width="175" height="186" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em>braid crown start sewing at the center top of the crown. Pull
    up the draw thread at one end of the braid. (If the braid has no drawstring,
      run one in with a shirring.) Curve the braid in a lengthened circle or
    oval. Turn back one end for a finish. The center should be a finished oval
    with braid edge forming the oval-edge. </p>
    <p>Lap the selvage of the braid under
        the edge of the preceding row. Pull up the draw
      string just enough to make the edge curve to fit the crown or mold. Slide
      the needle under the braid. Take a small hidden stitch on top and a longer
      stitch on the wrong side. Do not stitch through the frame at any time.
      When the top oval has been sewn almost as large as the top of the crown,
      Dress it with a moderately hot iron on the wrong side. Then pin it in place
      on the top of the buckram' crown. If a wooden mold is used, fasten it with
      thumb tacks. Continue sewing down row after row until the base of
    the crown is reached. Remove pins or tacks and press from the inside. <em><strong><a href="illust/044.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,426);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/044-t.jpg" alt="Figure 44" width="156" height="188" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em>This
    crown may be used over a soft, pressed crown or over a headsize band as foundation.</p>
    <h6><strong>Figure 42. Starting the Center of the Braid Crown.</strong></h6>
    <h6><strong>Figure 43. Molding a Braid Crown.</strong></h6>
    <h6><strong>Figure 44. Braid Hat with Fabric Facing. Molded Braid Crown with
    Side-Crown Foundation.</strong></h6>
    <p class="clear"><strong><a name="iicr2" id="iicr2"></a>2. Sewing braid to a pressed crown. </strong>Sewing braid to a
      pressed crown is done in the same way, except that the stitches are taken
      through the crown after
    the tip is started in the hand. Very tight stitches may be taken because
      the crown holds them in place. Use long stitches inside the crown and small
      hidden
    stitches on the outside.</p>
    
    <h4><a name="iipb" id="iipb"></a>PLAIN BRIM</h4>
    
    <p><strong><a name="iipb1" id="iipb1"></a>1. With a frame.</strong> Bind the frame edge with a row of braid or 1-inch bias strip
    of silk.</p>
    <p>Sew the first row of braid flat over the binding. Allow only 1/8 inch
      of silk to show. Start the first row a little to one side of the back so
      that
    there is room to lap the second row over the end of the first at a gradual
      slant. Pull up the thread on the inner edge. Continue sewing row after
    row until the headsize is reached.</p>
    
    <p>Irregular <em><strong><a href="illust/046.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',588,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/046-t.jpg" alt="Figure 46" width="200" height="142" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em>brims <em><strong><a href="illust/045.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,734);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/045-t.jpg" alt="Figure 45" width="200" height="156" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em>will need extra rows at the wider parts.</p>
    
    <p>Always sew the outer rows first and fill in the extra rows at the headsize.</p>
    <h6><strong>Figure 45. Starting the First Row of Braid as a Binding on the
        Edge of the Brim.</strong></h6>
    <h6><strong>Figure 46. Slanting the Braid for the Second Row.</strong></h6>
    <p class="clear"><strong><a name="iipb2" id="iipb2"></a>2. Without a frame.</strong> Sport hats are often made without frames, as it is desirable
    for them to be very soft. In order to shape them they are sewn over a frame
    as a mold and then removed from the frame.</p>
    
    <p>For such hats the braid is sewn by slanting the needle (not sticking through
    the frame). Then the braid can be removed from the frame and the edge wired.
    Sew the under facing in the same way. Remove from the frame and join the
    top and under brims at the edge.</p>
    <p>Sew the crown over a mold (see <a href="#ii">section II</a>, above) and attach it to the
    brim at the headsize.</p>
    <p>If the brim is an even shape, the crown may be sewn to the brim and the
    braid sewn from top crown to brim edge in one piece.</p>
    
    <h4><a name="iibraid" id="iibraid"></a>FANCY SEWING OF BRAID BRIMS IN DESIGNS</h4>
    <p> In sewing dress hats of hair, lis&egrave;re,
      milan, and visca braid the braid is often sewn in designs of scallops,
      loops, and points. Individual patterns give the designs used.</p>
    <h4><a name="iicrown" id="iicrown"></a>FANCY CROWN SEWING</h4>
    
    <p>The narrower braids are often sewn in designs as part of the trimming for
    semitailored models. The braid designs are given with the patterns.</p>
    
    <h4><a name="iimilan" id="iimilan"></a>SEWING MILAN AND LIS&Egrave;RE</h4>
    
    <p>Milan and lis&egrave;re have a harder finish than any other braids. They have
      enough body so that the braid when sewn will hold together without a frame
      but must be soaked in water in order that one
    may sew them without breaking the straw.</p>
    
    <p><strong><a name="iimilan1" id="iimilan1"></a>1. Soaking braid. </strong>This means merely soaking the braid
      in warm water before sewing it. Allow the braid to be submerged for about
      five minutes. Shake off the loose water and wrap
    the braid in newspaper or a towel. It is then ready for sewing.</p>
    
    <p><strong><a name="iimilan2" id="iimilan2"></a>2. Molding over wire frame. </strong>The soaked lis&egrave;re or milan
      may be molded over a wire frame (brim or crown). Bind the edge of the frame
      with any cotton material. Baste the first row of braid
    to the binding with long stitches that are easily pulled out when the hat
    is dry.</p>
    <p>Sew the braid over the wire frame just as on a pressed frame. Slant the second
    row over the end of the first at the back. Sew the second row to the first
    and the third to the second. Continue to the headsize. Be careful not to
    stitch over the wires or the threads will break when the braid is removed
    from the frame. Do not stretch the braid tightly on the wire frame or it
    will draw the frame out of shape and the braid will have a poor line.</p>
    
    <p><strong><a name="iimilan3" id="iimilan3"></a>3. Molding over wooden blocks.</strong> For a crown, shape and sew the soaked braid
    over a wooden block just as for a soft crown. Split or rip the braid in half
    for the center tip. When the center oval has a small diameter of 1 inch,
    use the entire width of braid (see <a href="#ii">section II</a>, above). When the braid has
    been shaped over the crown, fasten it at the headsize with thumb tacks and
    let it remain on the block until dry.</p>
    
    <p>Brims may be sewn over wooden blocks by fastening the first row of braid
    with thumb tacks and sewing each row of braid to the one preceding it.</p>
    
    <p>A buckram brim will serve the purpose of a wooden mold and hold in shape
    for sewing three or four hats.</p>
    
    <p><strong><a name="iimilan4" id="iimilan4"></a>4. Drying braid.</strong> Always be sure that the braid is thoroughly dry before removing
    it from the mold or frame. It loses its shape if it is still damp. The dampness
    will spoil the shellac finish.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="iimilan5" id="iimilan5"></a>5. Shellac finish. </strong>Shellac for braids is a specially prepared shellac for
    millinery purposes. It dries quickly and is lightweight. Black and transparent
    shellac are used more than colors. The transparent kind may be used for all
    colors.</p>
    
    <p>A coat of shellac restores the shine which is lost in soaking braids.</p>

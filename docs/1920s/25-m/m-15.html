<h2>CHAPTER XV&#8212;LINE HARMONY</h2>
    <h3><a name="i" id="i"></a>I. FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LINE</h3>
    
    <p>Anyone who studies algebra and geometry develops the imagination and trains
    the eye to see. The really successful hat is one which has style, line, good
    workmanship, and becomingness. The first three attributes involve mathematics
    and it takes all three to make the fourth&#8212;becomingness.</p>
    
    <h4><a name="ipr" id="ipr"></a>PRINCIPLES OF LINE IN ART</h4>
    <p>The fine arts are those which have primarily to do with imagination and taste,
    and are applied to the production of what is beautiful. Sculpture, painting,
    and architecture are the accepted fine arts.</p>
    
    <p><strong><a name="ipr1" id="ipr1"></a>1. Sculpture. </strong>Sculpture is the representation of life in wood, stone, or
    metal.</p>
    
    <p>Millinery more nearly approaches sculpture than it does any other of the
    arts in the matter of line. Each has the three dimensions ; each involves
    the breaking up of mass into line and form, though methods, materials, and
    purpose are vastly different.</p>
    
    <p>Greek sculpture attained the highest point of perfection and is universally
    accepted as the standard of beauty. Simplicity and fidelity of line are the
    keynote of Greek masterpieces in bronze and marble. Every superfluous line
    is eliminated. Beauty, grace, and naturalness are the result.</p>
    
    <p>Marble pictures made with the utmost simplicity of line and detail attain
    the highest point in the sculptor's art.</p>
    
    <p><strong><a name="ipr2" id="ipr2"></a>2. Painting.</strong> Webster's definition of painting is &quot;a
      work of art in which objects are presented in color on a flat surface.&quot;</p>
    
    <p>The painter may use light, shadow, and color, as well as line. He may utilize
    all four to give the illusion of form and dimension to a flat surface. The
    great painting is that one which gives the illusion of reality, the effect
    of life and form, with a few, telling lines. Art involves constant practice
    in restraint and elimination. A few lines, bold and decided, or fine and
    delicate, give beauty which cannot be produced by mere detail.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="ipr3" id="ipr3"></a>3. Japanese prints. </strong>Japanese art is an outstanding example
      of what may be accomplished with line. Japanese prints stand alone for
      sheer
    beauty in this regard.</p>
    
    <h4><a name="imil" id="imil"></a>PRINCIPLES OF LINE IN MILLINERY</h4>
    
    <p><strong><a name="imil1" id="imil1"></a>1. General principles.</strong> In millinery, line gives to the hat that intangible
    thing called style. A hat may be very pretty and becoming, but have no line
    or style. In choosing a hat it is always well to know which you want.</p>
    
    <p><strong><a name="imil2" id="imil2"></a>2. Harmonizing of line with the costume.</strong> It must be remembered that a hat
    is but one unit of a costume. To make a complete and perfect whole, the line
    of the hat must be in harmony with the general lines of the rest of the costume.</p>
    <p>A hat of tailored lines may be all that is desirable when worn with street
    costumes and utterly ugly when worn with frocks.</p>
    
    <p><strong><a name="imil3" id="imil3"></a>3. Harmonizing of hat lines with the general style.</strong></p>
    
    <p><em>Mode of hairdressing. </em>The mode of hairdressing is always a determining factor
    in the matter of becoming line. A fluffy mode, a smooth, severe arrangement,
    a shingle, or a Russian bob make the lines of the head entirely different.
    The lines of the hat must be adjusted and adapted to each manner of dressing
    the hair. Different qualities are required in a hat to make it comfortable.
    This changes the line of the crown, and the brim line must be changed to
    correspond.</p>
    <p><strong>Fashion silhouette. </strong>Styles in line change with the seasons. What is good
    this year, may be out of fashion next.</p>
    
    <h3><a name="ii" id="ii"></a>II. PRINCIPLES OF LINE AS APPLIED TO THE INDIVIDUAL</h3>
    
    <h4><a name="iiob" id="iiob"></a>OBJECTS TO BE ATTAINED</h4>
    
    <p>The modern idea of facial beauty is regularity of features and profile
      with irregularity of head line&#8212;the head line being exaggerated
      by the knot or cut of the hair. This idea does not vary greatly from the
      ancient
      Greek sculptor's formula.</p>
    
    <p>The classifications given and the hat lines suggested are all done with
      the purpose of gaining an effect of regularity of features. Every woman
      knows
    that there is no real beauty or depth of character in a perfectly regular
    face. Few of us need worry over our perfections. But all of us like to make
    our faulty features less conspicuous so that we are not known as &quot;that
    girl with the long nose,&quot; or &quot;that girl with no chin.&quot;</p>
    
    <p><strong><a name="iiob1" id="iiob1"></a>1. Greater beauty for the individual.</strong> As has been said, the real purpose
    of any hat is to add to and enhance the good points of the wearer.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="iiob2" id="iiob2"></a>2. Beauty of line in the hat.</strong> Beauty of line in the hat is the goal for which
    the designer strives. The choosing of that hat with good lines, which brings
    out and complements the good and minimizes the bad points of the individual,
    is the task of the milliner.</p>
    
    <p><strong><a name="iiob3" id="iiob3"></a>3. Conformity with fashion dictates.</strong> In selecting a hat
      it is necessary to choose one in keeping with the lines of the rest of
      the wardrobe&#8212;sport
      lines for sport clothes; dressier, softer lines with dressier suits and
      frocks. Close, trim hats are best for the narrow silhouette and straight
      lines. Larger
      hats or medium hats of exaggerated lines are in keeping with the bouffante
      silhouette. High bandeaux and raised back lines are in keeping with the
      Directoire profile.</p>
    
    <p>Always, in line, as in other matters of dress, the paramount thing is
      to have such harmony that the clothing is but a fitting frame for the pictured
    individual and the observer conscious only of the personality, not of the
    garments.</p>
    
    <h4><a name="iisp" id="iisp"></a>SPECIFIC TYPES</h4>
    <p><strong><a name="iisp1" id="iisp1"></a>1. Prominent nose. </strong>There are two points which every woman
      with a large nose must remember about her hats. She cannot wear brimless
      hats nor hard crowns of any kind without exaggerating
    the already prominent feature.</p>
    
    <p class="clear"><em>With<strong><a href="illust/100.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,396);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/100-t.jpg" alt="Figure 100" width="140" height="199" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong> glasses <strong><a href="illust/099.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,492);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/099-t.jpg" alt="Figure 99" width="140" height="169" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>and long chin.</em> For this type a brim which extends
      at least beyond the glasses and the nose is necessary. A brim which turns
      up at one side and has some irregularity, as in figures 99 and 100, is
      best for
    this type. A straight sailor is too regular of line and makes irregular features
    more pronounced by contrast.</p>
    <h6><strong><a name="fig99" id="fig99"></a>Figure 99. Note the Wide Soft Lines of Both Brim and Crown.</strong></h6>
    <h6><strong><a name="fig100" id="fig100"></a>Figure 100. The Brim Extends Out Over the Face before Turning
        Up. The Handmade Quill Gives Width and Irregularity of Line.</strong></h6>
    <p>A decidedly mushroom brim obscures the top half of the face oval until
    only the lower half (the long nose and chin) remains visible. Therefore a
      wide, soft crown of irregular line, and a medium-size brim of irregular
      line and some width, are best for this
    type of face.</p>
    
    <p><em>With glasses and short chin. </em>Glasses, as we said before, necessitate some
    brim. A short chin changes the requirements of the type above to a smaller
    brim and crown. The lines may be practically the same. The crown may be as
    high, but not as wide.</p>
    
    <p><em>With receding forehead.</em> This is one of the most difficult types
      of faces to fit with a becoming hat. As a rule, the headsize is small,
      yet the lines of the hat need to be soft, rather wide, and irregular. A
      small rolled or straight brim with a small coronet, which has width and
    some height, is always becoming, coronet may be embroidered with soft materials,
    as ribbonzene or georgette folds, or narrow ribbon. The embroidered material
    may be draped on loosely. The coronet may be covered with very small flowers
    or with folds of taffeta or hair braid. A ruff of velvet or a wired flare
    of lace will give the same desired effect. </p>
    <p>With prominent forehead. A prominent
      nose and prominent forehead rarely occur together. When they do, they usually
      belong to a person of strong and marked mental characteristics If the face
      is full, wide upturned brims and irregular draped turbans that have not
      a severe headsize line may be worn that are wide at the side and narrower
      at
      front and back is becoming if there is some irregularity of line. As a
      rule, a frame has to be shaped and adjusted for each individual of this
      type.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="iisp2" id="iisp2"></a>2. Small or snub nose.</strong> As a rule, a small snub, or tip-tilted,
      nose belongs to a little face. The face may take on fat, t most likely
      started life small.</p>
    
    <p>Here more than in other types, the rule of keeping a crown proportionate
    to the width of the face oval should be followed This means that the crown
    should be very little wider and narrower than the face at its widest point.</p>
    <p><em>With glasses.</em> Small brims very nearly straight or slightly rolled
      are becoming to this group. Soft ribbon hats that roll from the face are
      good because
    they do not form an abrupt turn at the headsize. Tricorns and irregular napoleons
    are becoming. Larger hats cannot be too extreme in size. They are usually
    becoming with short or turned-up backs. A short back line balances better
    with the flat profile than does a wide back.</p>
    <p><em> With low forehead.</em> A girl with
      a low forehead and a snub can almost invariably wear becoming chin-chin
      hats, rolled sailors, tricorns, and brims of the walking-hat order. Larger
      hats must have perfectly coordinate lines, usually with a short roll at
      the back and not too great width anywhere.</p>
    <p><em>With high cheek bones. </em>Hats for a girl with high cheek bones
      and a small nose take a great deal of study. Small brims with wide, soft
      trimming; small
    brims with tam crowns; sailors; and irregular, wide, small hats, are safest
    and most fitting to the type.</p>
    
    <p class="clear"><strong><a name="iisp3" id="iisp3"></a>3. Wide<em><a href="illust/102.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,444);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/102-t.jpg" alt="Figure 102" width="140" height="174" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em> face <em><a href="illust/101.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,431);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/101-t.jpg" alt="Figure 101" width="140" height="164" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>oval.</strong> A wide face oval usually needs wide,
      soft crowns, as cap crowns draped wide from side to side, saddle crowns,
    two-section crowns, and tam crowns.</p>
    <h6><strong><a name="fig101" id="fig101"></a>Figure 101. The Hat in This Figure Has Soft Width with Lifted
        Lines. This Makes It Becoming to the Wide Face Oval.</strong></h6>
    <h6><strong>Figure 102. The Brim of This Hat Is Cut in an Interesting Way
        to Give Height and Irregularity of Line.</strong></h6>
    <p><em>With high cheek bones. </em>A wide face with high cheek bones needs
      an unusual kind of irregularity. The crown must be kept low or there will
      be an exaggerated kind of oval effect formed by the crown and lower
    part of the face. There must be width of brim to counterbalance the width
    of face, usually an up-turned brim. A slash at the side of the brim with
    added width of ribbon ornament or feather is a good formula. Wide napoleons
    and continentals are becoming. A girl of this type must be careful of the
    way she wears her hat. A very slight angle with the brim pulled well down
      on the head is good. A hat worn back on the head with this kind of face
    becomes grotesque.</p>
    
    <p class="clear"><em>With <strong><a href="illust/104.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,471);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/104-t.jpg" alt="Figure 104" width="140" height="173" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>wide,<strong><a href="illust/103.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,714);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/103-t.jpg" alt="Figure 103" width="100" height="121" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong> high
        forehead.</em> A wide face oval and wide forehead
      invariably mean a large headsize. Together they mean wide, soft crowns,
      and wide, exaggerated
    brims with a bend or roll. Slashed brims&#8212;that is, irregular, up-turned
    brims with a slash at the side or side front&#8212;give good lines (see
    figures 103 and 104). Only French (slightly rolled) sailors
    and flat brims with rolled edge or a mushroom effect at the headsize
    and a straight flange are becoming.</p>
    <h6><strong><a name="fig103" id="fig103"></a>Figure 103. The Brim of This Design Gives Broken Lines Very Becoming
        to Many Full Face Ovals.</strong></h6>
    <h6><strong>Figure 104. The Slashed Front of This Brim Gives Irregularity
        to Its High Flare.</strong></h6>
    <p><em>With glasses.</em> A wide face oval with glasses means that there
      must not be a decided or severe headsize line, Otherwise the formula is
      the
    same as for Figure 104 below.</p>
    <p><em>With large headsize and much hair.</em> There is a straight crown
      which is very becoming to this type when the side crown is softly draped
      with even folds
    of fabric. It is generally used on a modified-shepherdess or a walking-hat
    brim. Brims which are wide and irregular and roll from, rather than turn
      off, the face are becoming. A big headsize means, of course, a  brim proportionately
      large.</p>
    
    <p><em>With small nose and chin. </em>A wide face oval with small nose and
      chin needs soft, wide crowns that are of medium height, as a four-section
      cap crown,
    large cap or puffed crown, and some of the crowns made entirely of folds.
    Small napoleons, irregular turbans, small-brim hats with irregular
    width in the trimming, and poke brims with transparent maline or lace edges
    make good frames for this kind of face.</p>
    
    <p class="clear"><strong><em><a href="illust/105.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,416);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/105-t.jpg" alt="Figure 105" width="140" height="206" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="iisp4" id="iisp4"></a>4. Narrow face oval. </strong>The hat becoming to the narrow face oval is one that
    will soften the lines of the face (the features of a narrow face oval have
    a tendency to be sharp) and shorten the length of the face. Many of the small
    mushrooms and pokes are becoming. Turned-up brims should come well down over
    the head before turning. Turbans must be wide and soft with a lower drape
    or line of folds on one side (see Figure 105).</p>
    <h6><strong><a name="fig105" id="fig105"></a>Figure 105. Note the Small Brim and Soft Width Used for This
    Turban.</strong></h6>
    <p><em>With very long nose.</em> There is a medium rolled brim with lines
      between those of a chin-chin and a French sailor which is becoming to this
      type (see Figures
      <a href="#fig99">99</a> and <a href="#fig101">101</a>). Fabric crowns that are draped over the pressed crown, giving
      softness and some width, are becoming to this type of face. Hats that have
      very irregular lines, like
    a modified or cut tricorn, give good brim lines. </p>
    <p><em>With very low forehead.</em>      For a long face oval with low forehead the general lines as given in <a href="#fig100">Figure
      100</a>, are good. As the crown presents a separate problem, four-section cap
        crowns pulled low on one side, and regulation cap crowns wide from side
        to side and draped low at the right
      side, give good lines for this type.</p>
    <p><em>With long chin.</em> A long face oval with a long chin makes some width in an
    up-turned hat necessary for balance of line. Mushroom brims are good if they
    are not severe and if they do not droop decidedly. A brim which droops a
    great deal shows only hat, a little face, and a long chin.</p>
    
    <p><em>Of very tall person.</em> The lines of the hats becoming to the girl
      with a long face oval are those which shorten the face line. They also
      shorten
    the silhouette or add nothing to the general length effect, so there is no
    extra problem involved.</p>
    
    <p><em>With much hair. </em>This means a long face oval with a large headsize. The brim
    lines may be the same. They need only be exaggerated and the brim made wider
    in proportion to the crown.</p>
    
    <p><strong><a name="iisp5" id="iisp5"></a>5. The round face.</strong> The hat for a round face oval should
      be so designed as to add to or lengthen the oval. The crown must always
      be wider than the face at its widest point. A narrow crown makes the
    face seem larger.</p>
    
    <p><em>With snub nose.</em> A snub, or short, nose with a round face means that the hat
    cannot be too large of brim and cannot turn up too decidedly from the forehead.
    A brim which extends out an inch or more and then turns up is becoming if
    it has wide irregularity. Width of brim and lifted line are needed for the
    full face (see <a href="#fig103">Figure 103</a>).</p>
    
    <p>Care must be exercised not to have the brim turned too high or the line will
    make the nose seem even smaller.</p>
    
    <p><em>With glasses.</em> The round face oval with glasses makes it necessary for a hat
    to have more brim than the other types under this heading.</p>
    
    <p class="clear"><em><strong><a href="illust/106.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,454);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/106-t.jpg" alt="Figure 106" width="140" height="194" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong></em>A brim which rolls decidedly in the back, slightly at the sides, and extends
    almost straight over the face to about three inches in front and three and
    one-half or four inches at the side fronts is always good (see Figure 106).
    Large, soft crowns, irregular brims with width, and only the turned-up brims
    that have a visor or a headsize roll are becoming to girls or women of this
    division.</p>
    <h6><strong>Figure 106. Width of Brim, Short Back, and Rolled Front Make
    This Style Becoming to Many Women.</strong></h6>
    <p><em>Very small chin</em>. A small chin with a round face presents an added
      difficulty to the already difficult matter of selecting a becoming hat.
      This particular
    set of features usually belong to a short person and the hat should have
    lines which add length to the silhouette. The accepted means of obtaining
    height are not possible because they would make a top-heavy effect in proportion
    to the face, and a high trimming, or an extremely high crown or brim will
    make the chin smaller by comparison.</p>
    <p>Draped turbans of the modified Hindu type (see <a href="#fig105">Figure
        105</a>), but with a
      small brim or visor, small brims with wide draped crowns, and close-fitting
      tricorns
    or napoleons are becoming to this classification. There must be no drooping
    lines to cut either profile or silhouette line. The effect is rather that
    of height without high trimming.</p>
    
    <p><em>With very high forehead.</em> A round face with a very high forehead of course
    means a large face with an oval both high and wide.</p>
    
    <p>A large, well-fitting headsize is always one of the first requisites. The
    hat should be worn well down over the head. The crown must be wide and soft
    and of average height. The brim may be a sailor, a slightly drooping mushroom,
    or a modified tricorn of low rather than high lines. Full crown trimmings,
    as flowers or feathers, make good balance with the face lines.</p>
    
    <h4><a name="iimode" id="iimode"></a>MODE OF HAIRDRESSING ADAPTED TO TYPES</h4>
    
    <p><strong><a name="iimode1" id="iimode1"></a>1. As it affects the facial contour.</strong> The manner of dressing the hair may
    do much to change and soften the lines of the face. There are very few women
    who can wear their hair pulled straight back from the face without any softness.
    Women who have smooth skin and beautiful, lustrous, not extremely soft hair,
    often adopt this severity of line and wear the extreme clothing and jewels
    which are accessories to the bizarre effect that they desire.</p>
    <p>To the average woman, in nine hundred and ninety-five out of a thousand cases,
    who is neither extremely beautiful nor extremely plain, a soft arrangement
    of the hair is vastly more becoming. It is too obvious for detailed remark
    that some width at the sides and over the ears softens and widens the contour
    of the thin face, that a round face needs a higher head dress, that a high
    forehead needs the hair pulled low in front or parted at one side to obscure
    part of the forehead, and that usually the hair should be combed straight
    back from a low forehead to take advantage of all the possible length of
    oval.</p>
    
    <p><strong><a name="iimode2" id="iimode2"></a>2. As it affects the profile. </strong>As the old Greek conception
      of facial perfection was a straight profile and an irregular head line
      (men with a head wide from the face to the back of the head, wide spacing
    from eye to ear; and women with regular features, who dressed their hair
    in a Psyche knot), so the hair arrangement today should be made to soften
    the profile where the features are sharp or too decided, and to exaggerate
    their size where the features are not sufficiently pronounced, in order to
    achieve, as far as possible, the Grecian ideal.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="iimode3" id="iimode3"></a>3. As it affects the hat.</strong> As a general rule, a hat is
      more becoming when the hair shows just a little on the forehead and at
      the sides.</p>
    
    <p>A hat which is worn so that it shows no hair is apt to be disfiguring.</p>
    
    <p>A large knot of hair requires a hat adjusted to fit the hair. When the
      hair is worn in a large knot on top of the head, the crown must be deeper
      than
    for the usual head dress. To adjust the crown properly, allow at least one
    inch at the headsize of any crown pattern.</p>
    
    <p>When the hair is worn in a large knot at the back of the head, the headsize
    of the brim and the crown headsize should be shaped in a decided oblong.
    If a pressed crown foundation is used, it will need to be raised. Rip the
    headsize wire. Stitch a bias strip of elastic net or buckram to the headsize
    edge. Trim the lower edge of this strip evenly and wire it. Add an extra
    inch to the headsize of the crown pattern to allow fullness for the crown
    and hair.</p>
    <p>Never plan to adjust the hair for a certain hat. Only a lady of leisure
      has time to do this. Adjust the hat to the hair.</p>
    <p>To put on a hat properly, catch the headsize of the hat over the top half
    of the knot, pull the hat well down in front, and tilt it slightly down on
    the right side. For a bob pull the hat over the back of the head, down in
    front, and tilt it to the right in the same way.</p>
    
    <p>Only the girl with perfect features can wear a hat straight. A slight angle
    preserves better balance of line with irregular features.</p>

<h2>  CHAPTER I&#8212;WIRE FRAMES</h2>
<h3>  <a name="intro" id="intro"></a>INTRODUCTION</h3>
  <p> The making of wire frames comes first in the many steps involved in hat
    construction because the original mold for any hat or hat frame is made of
    wire. Therefore,
  wire frames are made the subject of our first chapter.</p>
  <p> For practical beginner's work, however, a wire frame is a very poor first
    lesson, as they are difficult to make until the student has learned to manipulate
    millinery
  materials. The wise plan is to have the students familiarize themselves with
    <a href="m-01.html">Chapters I</a> and <a href="m-02.html">II</a> by reading only and to begin actual hat construction with
  pattern frames, <a href="m-03.html">Chapter III</a>.</p>
  <p> Students who have only a brief millinery course and short class periods
    for a few semesters should not attempt wire frames. They are, however, very
    necessary
  for anyone who means to make much of millinery or to train for professional
  work.</p>
  <h3> <a name="i" id="i"></a>I. USES OF WIRE FRAMES </h3>
  <h4><a name="iwire" id="iwire"></a>WIRE FRAMES FOR MOLDING</h4>
  <p> Wire frames always suggest transparent hats, but to the milliner their
    greatest importance is for workroom use as molds over which to stretch handmade
    frames
  (see <a href="m-02.html">Chapter II</a>).</p>
  <p> The designer of original models shapes the wire frame. A maker usually
    prepares the frame ready for the shaping and edge wire and braces it with
    brace wires
  tied at very close intervals.
  After the designer gives the outline and the maker ties in the brace wires,
  it is ready for the frame material to be stretched over it or to use as a model
  for braid sewing.</p>
  <p> If a French hat or any model hat of rolled or irregular brim is to be copied,
  a wire frame is made first. A wire headsize is made with long brace wires (see
    <a href="#iii">section III</a> of this chapter). This wire headsize is slipped inside the hat
  headsize and the wires bent back over the hat and shaped exactly like it. The
  edge wire may be tied on to the cross braces and enough round brace wires tied
  on (but not cut) to give the exact shape of the hat.</p>
  <p> Care must be exercised not to get the wire frame larger than the hat because
  the willow or elastic stretched over it is naturally a little larger than the
  wire frame when finished.  </p>
  <p>A willow or elastic net frame stretched over a wire frame made in this way
  will give more exact duplication of a shape than any other frame can.</p>
  <p><strong> <a name="i1" id="i1"></a>1. Elastic molded over a wire frame. </strong>Elastic net makes a soft frame with
    a good deal of body to it and is desirable for stretching turbans, small
    frames,
  and medium brims. There is no other frame material which is so soft and yet
  holds its shape so well.</p>
  <p> <strong><a name="i2" id="i2"></a>2. Buckram molded over a wire frame.</strong> Buckram makes a much stiffer frame,
    one which will stand a great deal of handling in the making. While it is
    easier
  for the amateur milliner to handle, it will break more easily when worn than
will an elastic net frame, and is never so comfortable as a softer frame.</p>
  <p> There are two grades of buckram, one rather heavy grade which is commonly
    sold when one merely asks for buckram, and a much lighter grade called jockey
    buckram.
  Jockey makes a good frame on which to sew straw braid. It makes a good foundation
  for velvet and any material with a nap. If cr&ecirc;pe, taffeta,
  or satin is used on a stretched buckram frame, an interlining must always be
  used or the hat is hard-looking.</p>
  <p><strong> <a name="i3" id="i3"></a>3. Willow molded over a wire frame.</strong> Willow, when a good quality can be
    obtained, is the most satisfactory material for stretching large and irregular
    brims.
  It really is a two-ply or double-frame material. One ply of it is a fine, lightweight
  crinoline. The other is a pliable weave of willow fiber. The two materials
  are sized (or starched) and dried together. The willow gives stiffness, the
  crinoline gives it body.</p>
  <p> The better grades of willow are made in Switzerland and France. During
    the war none was imported to America. The only thing obtainable was a much
    inferior
  quality which came from Japan.</p>
  <p> It is still almost impossible to get the better grade of willow. In many
    workrooms milliners have given up trying to use the Japanese quality, and
    elastic net
  or one thickness of elastic net and one of cape net are used instead. The Japanese
  use a quality of fiber which is either so brittle that it breaks under the
  most careful handling or so soft that the frame will not hold its shape.</p>
  <h4> <a name="itrans" id="itrans"></a>WIRE FRAMES FOR TRANSPARENT HATS</h4>
  <p> The fewer round braces that can be used for a transparent hat the softer
      and more attractive looking it will be. A sprung-steel edge wire makes
      a truer
  outline and eliminates the need of round brace wires (see <a href="#fig3">Figure
  3</a>).</p>
  <p><strong> <a name="it1" id="it1"></a>1. Frames for transparent lace hats.</strong> Transparent lace hats are divided
  into two classes according to the edge finishes used.</p>
  <p><em> Soft extended lace edges. </em>The finished edge of the lace from which
    the hat is made is extended beyond the edge wire, giving an irregular and
    draped
    effect.
  For this type of hat the edge wire must be wrapped (or wound) with maline as
  a finish and as something to sew to. The brace wires are also wrapped unless
  a ma-line underfacing is used (see <a href="m-09.html#ii">Chapter IX, section
  II</a>).</p>
  <p><em> Fold edges of fabric.</em> A bias fold of velvet, soleil, silk, or maline is
    sewn to the frame edge. This may be extended beyond the edge wire, giving
    a soft
  edge, or it may be turned back over the top of the hat in a more tailored fashion.</p>
  <p> In either case an underfacing is used and the wires need not be wrapped.</p>
  <p><strong> <a name="it2" id="it2"></a>2. Frames for transparent maline hats. </strong>The wire frame for a soft or shirred
  maline hat is made in the same way as one for a soft lace hat (see <a href="m-09.html#ii">Chapter
  IX, section II</a>).</p>
  <p> The wire frame for a fitted maline hat (see <a href="m-09.html#iii">Chapter
      IX</a>) must
  have more braces than one for a soft hat.</p>
  <p> When maline is fitted on a wire frame, more braces are necessary to keep
  the maline from falling out of shape between the wires.</p>
  <p> If a fitted-fabric edge flange is used, frame net or crinoline must first
  be fitted in place (see <a href="m-09.html#fig48">Figure 48, Chapter IX</a>).</p>
  <p><strong> <a name="it3" id="it3"></a>3. Frames for hair-braid hats.</strong> Wire frames for transparent hair hats need
    a number of round braces, but not so many as for a stretched frame. In a
    medium-sized
  brim braces one inch apart are sufficient. For an irregular-shaped brim the
  braces must outline the curves of the hat, or the braid will make an ugly line.  </p>
  <p>Edge wire for hair hats should be wrapped with maline. This gives a foundation
    to which the first row of braid may be sewn.</p>
  <h4> <a name="iavoid" id="iavoid"></a>WIRE-FRAME USES TO BE AVOIDED</h4>
  <p> The following &quot;don'ts&quot; will be invaluable in making wire frames.</p>
  <p> Never sew any except hair or transparent braid over a wire frame, as a
    wire frame braced sufficiently to hold braid will be
  heavier than a pressed frame, and wire headsizes are never so comfortable.</p>
  <p> Never fit velvet over a wire frame, as the wires make a mark or mar on
    the velvet, which is ugly. The effect is never smooth. The headsize is never
    comfortable.
  The edge finish is always bulky.</p>
  <p> Never try to use a factory (ready-made) wire frame for really fine use,
    for the wire is always a poor quality, the outline of the edge wire is bad,
    braces
  are used where there is no need for them, and are omitted where they are needed,
  and the crowns are of an ungainly shape. There are very few times when it is
  desirable to use a wire-crown foundation for a transparent hat.</p>
  <h3> <a name="ii" id="ii"></a>II. MATHEMATICAL SIDE OF FRAME MAKING</h3>
  <h4> <a name="iiinv" id="iiinv"></a>MATHEMATICAL PRINCIPLES INVOLVED</h4>
  <p> Most girls feel that the time spent on
    geometry is wasted. Millinery is an outstanding example of the practical
    application
  of geometry. Certainly one may make a hat without having studied geometry,
  but a knowledge of circles, lines, and angles helps one immensely in frame
  construction and in cutting and fitting.</p>
  <p> Theoretically, the back and front brace wires are one straight
    line forming the diameter of a circle, which is the edge-wire circumference.
  So, too, are the brace wires from side to side and from side front to side
  back.</p>
  <p> <strong><a href="illust/001.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',538,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/001-t.jpg" alt="Figure 1" width="180" height="117" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>In the illustration, Figure 1, wires GE
    and FH extended across the headsize of the frame (dotted line EF) make the
  diameter of the circle.</p>
  <p> In frame construction, the same mathematical rules may be applied to a
    wire frame as to a circle. The edge wire is a circle with the center cut
    out for
  a headsize. Point X, the line of intersection, is the center of the circle.
  The braces form radii and diameters.</p>
  <h4> <a name="iiacc" id="iiacc"></a>MATHEMATICAL ACCURACY</h4>
  <p> Measures for wire frames must be absolutely exact if the hat is to be professional
  in appearance and becoming in line.</p>
  <p> In a perfect frame a tangent drawn on the circle (the headsize and edge
    wires) at the point of intersection of the diameter (the brace wires) forms
    a right
  angle with the diameter. See lines BC and AD. That is, the brace wire must
  slant on a true right angle straight from the headsize to the edge. If it is
  slanted to either side of the perpendicular, the given measures will be wrong
  and the edge wire pulled out of shape.</p>
  <h4> <a name="iired" id="iired"></a>ENLARGING OR REDUCING DIMENSIONS</h4>
  <p> Either of these processes can be performed without destroying the correct
  proportions.</p>
  <p> In geometry the rule is that <em>pi</em> &times; the diameter of a circle equals the circumference.
  In a wire frame one brace wire equals a radius or two brace wires as line GH
  equals the diameter. So <em>pi</em> (3.14159+) &times; 2 &times; the brace wire drawn from
  point X equals the edge wire.</p>
  <p> The edge wire is always given by the designer when she shapes the frame.
    The puzzling part is to make the frame larger or smaller and have the edge
    wire
  so exact that the slant of the brim will not be lost.</p>
  <p><strong> <a name="ii1" id="ii1"></a>1. A larger edge wire.</strong> If a frame is to be made &frac12; inch
    larger all around, 1 inch is really added to the diameter, &frac12; inch on each
    end of the diameter
    or
  each side of the hat&#8212;mathematically speaking, &frac12; inch on each radius.
  So <em>pi</em>, or 3.1+, &times; 1 inch = the amount added to the circumference = 3.1+.</p>
  <p> <strong><a href="illust/004.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',591,811);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/004-t.jpg" alt="Figure 4" width="200" height="144" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>In the dimensions given for the hat in Figure 4 the edge wire is 44 3/8inches.
  If the hat is made &frac12; inch larger all around, the edge wire will be 44 3/8inches
  + 3 1/16+ = 47&frac12; inches&nbsp;-. One-half inch will be added to each brace wire.</p>
  <p> If a frame is to be made one inch larger, two inches are actually added
  to the diameter, one inch at each end.</p>
  <p> Then <em>pi</em> (3.1+) &times; 2 inches = the amount added to the edge-wire circumference
  = 6.2 + inches.</p>
  <p> For the hat in Figure 4 an added inch all around the edge wire will be
  44 3/8 + 2 &times; 3&frac12; (<em>pi</em>) = 51 3/8 inches.</p>
  <p><strong> <a name="ii2" id="ii2"></a>2. Smaller edge wire. </strong>To make a frame smaller is a matter
    of subtraction instead of addition. To make a frame &frac12; inch smaller, subtract
    &frac12; inch from
    each brace
  wire (1 inch on the diameter) and subtract <em>pi</em> &times; this difference (1 inch) in
  diameter from the edge-wire circumference.</p>
  <p><strong> <a name="ii3" id="ii3"></a>3. Larger headsize. </strong>When the headsize must be larger and the edge wire
    is left the original size, the brace wires are changed. A headsize is also
    a circle
  and the rule of <em>pi</em> &times; the diameter still holds good.</p>
  <p> In the case of the edge wire, the changed diameter or radius measure is
  given.</p>
  <p> In the case of the headsize, the measure for the changed circumference
    is given: that is, the headsize needs to be a given amount, 1 inch or 2 inches
    larger.
  So the brace wires must be shortened.</p>
  <p> <a name="fig3" id="fig3"></a>The <strong><a href="illust/003.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',419,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/003-t.jpg" alt="Figure 3" width="220" height="110" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>headsize<strong><a href="illust/002.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,639);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/002-t.jpg" alt="Figure 2" width="180" height="174" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong> is a circle within a circle and the rule is inverted 
    (see Figure 2, headsize lines A extended to B). When a 25-inch head-size
      is to be made 1 inch larger (26 inches) the difference in the braces is
      the difference
  in circumferences or headsizes 1 inch (26 - 25 = 1) &divide; <em>pi</em>  (3.1+) = 1/3 inch +. Each brace wire is made 1/3 inch less.</p>
  <p><strong> <a name="ii4" id="ii4"></a>4. Smaller headsize. </strong>When the headsize must be smaller the edge wire is
    left the original size; the brace wires must be longer to reach to the smaller
    inner
  circle (see Figure 2, lines A extended to B).</p>
  <p> When a 25-inch head-size is to be made 1 inch smaller (24 inches) the difference
  in the braces is the difference in circumferences or head-size. 1 inch (25
  - 24 equals 1 inch) &divide; <em>pi</em> (3.1+) = 1/3 inch + . Each brace
  wire is made 1/3 inch longer. The rule 
  is the same as for making a headsize larger; but when the head-size is made
  smaller, length is added to the brace wire to make it reach the smaller inner
  circle.</p>

     <dt class="clear"> <h4> <a name="iiicor" id="iiicor"></a>CORRECT ORDER OF RECORDING MEASUREMENTS</h4>   </dt>
    <dd> Top headsize&#8212;24&frac12; inches    </dd>

    <dd>  Edge wire&#8212;44 3/8 inches</dd></dl>
    <p> The above order of recording measurements is used uniformly among good
      workmen. Note that the dimensions opposite each 
  other on a line are correspondingly opposite one another on a frame when assembled.
  Frames have usually eight braces. A frame with many curves, or one used for
  molding net and willow frames, may need more which can be added between the
  regular braces. Their length is gauged by the edge wire after it has been fastened
  to the regulation eight braces. Hence these extra braces rarely need measurement. </p>
    <h4> <strong><a href="illust/005a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',615,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/005a-t.jpg" alt="Figure 5a" width="220" height="164" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>GETTING CORRECT HEADSIZE    </h4>
    <p>Twenty-five inches is the average headsize for unbobbed hair. For bobbed
        hair twenty-two inches is the average size. To obtain a correct headsize
        measurement,
  pass a circle of wire around the head just where the headsize of a hat rests
  on the head. Allow 1/8 inch for the space taken up by the underfacing of the
  hat and the headsize lining. Allow the circle to lap 2&frac12; 
  inches and tie each end of the wire with a tie wire wrapped twice around and
  twisted tightly and cut. Make the upper of the two 
  headsizes &frac12; inch smaller than the lower one, the lower being the one measured.
  To change headsize measurement see subdivision in this chapter on enlarging
  or reducing dimensions.</p>

    <h4 class="clear"><a name="iiireq" id="iiireq"></a>GEOMETRICAL PRECISION REQUIRED</h4>
    <p> The following steps are to be taken with exactness.</p>
<p>      <strong><a href="illust/005b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,394);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/005b-t.jpg" alt="Figure 5b" width="140" height="220" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a><a name="iii1" id="iii1"></a>1. Marking the headsize for brace position.</strong> Mark the head-size for the position of the brace wires, using a pencil on white wire and tailors' chalk on black wire. The first mark is for the back on the lap halfway between  the two ends. Divide the headsize in eight sections starting with the tape measure at the back and marking each division as it is reached by the tape line.</p>
 <p> <em>Marking for a twenty-five-inch headsize.</em> A twenty-five-inch headsize properly
  divided will be marked from the back as the starting point 3 1/8 &#8212; 6&frac14; &#8212;
  9 3/8 &#8212; 12&frac12; (center front); 15 5/8 &#8212; 18&frac34; -21 7/8 and 25 (the
  back). Lap the ends and tie each one to the headsize wire with a 1-inch length
  of tie
  wire.</p>
 <p> The top headsize may be divided in the same way or only in four equal parts
  as the braces from the lower headsize will mark the one-eight divisions.</p>

  them by running the cushion part (not the tip) of the thumb and forefinger
  slowly over the length of wire. When all curves have been thus removed, bend
  2&frac12; inches from one end at right angles to the other. This bend B marks the
  position of the lower headsize wire. Place the lower (larger) headsize wire
  inside one of these wires at its center back, which was the first marked, and
  twist the brace wire around the back of the upper headsize about &frac34; inch above
  the lower headsize wire and cut it off, leaving only a short end (about 1/8
  inch) to bend down. Next, put the front brace wire onto the two headsizes in
  the same manner, then right and left sides and
side-front and side-back wires. To put the back wire on first insures firmness
  of the lapping, and the front second makes a true division and less confusion
  in working.

      wires for correct measurements. </strong>To mark the brace wires
  for correct measurements, place the zero end of the tape line at the lower
  base of the headsize. Measure to the given number and bend wire up at right
  angles.</p>
  <p>Lap the back brace wire over the edge wire joining at the
right angle and twist around once; cut off all but 1/8 inch end to bend
      down flat. Proceed with each brace wire in the same order as that used
on the head-size.</p>

        wire on the top and lower headsize wire.</span></strong></h6>

<h6><strong>Figure 6. <span class="small">Notice the closeness with which the
      brace wires are wrapped around the headsize and edge wires. The loop must
      be right before flattening it with the pliers. This means a quick, sharp
      bend of the brace wire close to the edge wire as is done in Figure 7.</span></strong></h6>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV&#8212;COLOR HARMONY AS APPLIED TO THE INDIVIDUAL</h2>
    
    <h3><a name="i" id="i"></a>I. PURPOSE OF COLOR IN ADORNING THE PERSON</h3>
    
    <p>The purpose of all personal adornment is to enhance the beauty of the individual.</p>
    
    <p>Garments are worn by wax models in a shop window to show the garments, not
    the models. She who wears her clothes to show them puts herself in the same
    relative position as the inanimate model.</p>
    
    <p>This does not mean that garments need not be smart, need not be beautiful&#8212;but
      the contrary. Who can know that a girl with olive skin, clear brown eyes,
      smooth brown hair is beautiful with a quaint and subtle charm of her own
      if she adopts the fads of the moment regardless of her own difference from
      other people? If she frizzes her hair and wears the blue, coral, and jades
      appropriate for a vivacious blond, her own charm is lost. She becomes merely
      one more like all the rest.</p>
    <p>By choosing garments and styles that are in themselves attractive, regardless
    of their suitability, many girls who could be immensely attractive are merely
    second-rate editions of what they might be.</p>
    
    <p>Uniformity may be desirable for an army or a penitentiary; certainly it
      is necessary for the manufacturing of automobile parts or electrical appliances
      or tooth pastes. But no feminine being has any desire so to submerge
    herself in the masses.</p>
    
    <p>The girl described should wear soft blue-greens, green-blues (pottery shades),
    Quaker gray, black with some oyster white, ivory or jade in relief, and some
    of the flame shades. Imagine this girl in a soft gray cr&ecirc;pe or organdie gown
    with exaggerated collar and cuffs of &eacute;cru organdie in John Alden style, and
    a black brim hat of shepherdess lines with tea-rose facing. The effect is
    such as to make you see the girl as an interesting person of outstanding
    individuality. Smooth, shining hair and quaint collar attract one to the
    face of the wearer. Tea-rose flush brings out the color needed to make the
    pallor of an olive skin beautiful. Rich black velvet with long, plain lines,
    square neck, and a touch of jade in earrings or pendant, and a hat of black
    with irregular, soft lines makes her a portrait of distinct beauty.</p>
    
    <p>A study of potential values in the appearance of an individual is the greatest
    asset in successful dressing of the individual. Color is one of the greatest
    helps in this matter of bringing out all the possibilities of beauty.</p>
    
    <p>The first principle to remember in choosing colors for an individual is
      that you are working for just one thing&#8212;the glorification or beautifying
      of that person.</p>
    
    <p>The beauty of a given color or color combination or garment is nonessential
    if it does not improve the looks of the person who is to wear it. An artist
    blends colors that they may give full value to each other. He uses colors
    complementary to one another, as a green with yellow tones with yellow for
    blending, or an orange-yellow with a blue-green for contrast. Each color
    is considered in relation to the other for the effect desired.</p>
    
    <p>In dressing a woman, every color must be considered in relation to the effect
    desired, but it must be remembered that the desired color effect is essentially
    different from that worked for in mere color harmony. The color combinations
    must be harmonious both in themselves and as applied to the wearer.</p>
    
    <p>The foundational element in all human beauty is an effect of health. An unhealthy
    person is never beautiful. A healthy-looking person is never quite ugly,
    whatever her features or coloring may be.</p>
    
    <p>The desirable colors for milady's hat are those that give her the rosy glow
    of health. The obvious answer to this demand is rose, red, or pink. The less
    obvious is certain blues for certain types, certain greens, tans, browns,
    and black for others. There is also the infrequent exception of the girl
    with too much color.</p>
    
    <h3><a name="ii" id="ii"></a>II. COLOR <em>VERSUS</em> TEMPERAMENT</h3>
    
    <p>Webster defines temperament as &quot;the peculiar physical and mental
      character of an individual.&quot; It is because temperament includes two elements,
    physical and mental, that color versus the temperament of an individual becomes
    a matter of complication.</p>
    <p>One's physical and mental individuality do not always match. Many a misshapen
    scrubwoman has the soul of a poet and is kindness itself. Too often the girl
    with limpid, violet eyes and rose-petal skin is the most soulless, selfish,
    and empty-headed of people.</p>
    
    <p>Why not dress the body in colors that will enhance the expression of one's
    temperament? It is just as stupid to dress your body in ugly clothes as it
    is to fill your mind with cheap and ugly literature.</p>
    
    <p>We are more than small who laugh when the apparently stolid and uninteresting
    person blossoms forth in gay and unseemly colors. But not all of us who love
      color have been taught the value of restraint and repression. Nor have
      all of us enough kindness to look for values underneath
    ugly exteriors. And since the Golden Age is not yet in sight and people not
    apt to be more patient and kindly, it behooves us to improve our externals
    and our own values as measured in the casual contacts of every-day life.
    Casual contacts are quite apt to shape our entire destiny in a work-a-day
    world.</p>
    
    <p>Not even a fat woman need be uninteresting and unpleasant in appearance,
    and no one (except a diseased person) need be actually obese.</p>
    <p>We say that a girl is handsome or homely according to whether or not her
    features and her physical person conform to accepted standards. Irregularity
    of features, however, need not keep one from being interesting, unusual,
    attractive, and popular. Study <em>your</em> set of features and <em>your</em> kind
    of body and make a fitting setting for them. If you have a gay and adventurous
    soul,
    give humanity some hint of it in your outer wrappings. In all casual or momentary
    meetings, we have the same status as package goods. No one is interested
    in a package of sweetmeats mussily and carelessly wrapped, if sweetmeats
    are to be had done up carefully and neatly.</p>
    
    <p>Many girls with inward charm of person and intellect feel bitterly aggrieved
    because girls with more apparent but superficial charm attract attention.
    Such girls must learn to pay more attention to the outward expression of
    their inherent attractions. This work-a-day world is busy with the obvious,
    the well-advertized. If the girl of retiring personality, of hidden depths
    of feeling and character, can learn to reveal and accentuate these qualities,
    she stands a far better chance of success in life than does the girl of flashing
    but shallow appeal.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII&#8212;DRESS-HAT TRIMMINGS</h2>
    
    <p>In choosing a dress hat remember always that there are two outstanding qualities
    for which designers strive in making this type of millinery. One is beauty,
    the other, style or chic. To attain both is a rarity. Decide in your own
    mind whether you want a sweet hat or a smart hat. Have both qualities when
    it is possible. Be sure that you know in your own mind what you want. You
    are then a great deal more likely to attain it.</p>
    
    <p>Dress-hat trimming may be divided into two classes, trimming which uses the
    hat for a background only, and trimming which is part of the design.</p>
    <h3><a name="i" id="i"></a>I. TRIMMING FOR WHICH THE HAT IS A BACKGROUND </h3>
    <p>There are times when a hat
      must be chosen for the trimming, rather than the trimming for the hat.
      Such trimmings are:</p>
    <h4 class="clear"><strong><em><a href="illust/084.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,620);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/084-t.jpg" alt="Figure 84" width="140" height="141" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em></strong><a name="iflo" id="iflo"></a>FLOWERS FOR THE GARDEN HAT</h4>
    <h6><strong>Figure 84. Straw Garden Hat with Wreath Trimming and Crepe Underfacing.</strong></h6>
    <p>Flower manufacturing has reached a high degree of perfection within the
      last ten years. Morning-glories, nasturtiums, fuchsias, sweet peas, camelias,
      dahlias, wistaria, and hosts of other flowers are copied
    with absolute fidelity to form and color.</p>
    
    <p>Not content with following the colors used by nature, the designers and
      dye makers go further and give us blue roses and pink lilies-of-the-valley.
    These are often so artistic in their conception and so satisfactory in effect
    that the divergence from authentic coloring is not objectionable.</p>
    
    <p class="clear"><strong><em><a href="illust/085.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,669);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/085-t.jpg" alt="Figure 85" width="140" height="129" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em></strong>Many beautiful wreaths and sprays may be purchased ready-made, but the
      same effects may be obtained at much less cost when a little taste and
      care is used in the making of a wreath.</p>
    <h6><strong>Figure 85. Garden Hat with Front Trimming of French Flowers.</strong></h6>
    <p>Colors and flowers chosen to match or harmonize with hat and frock make
      a much more pleasing completed costume than can be had in a combination
      wreath
    which is made of flowers and colors selected at random.</p>
    
    <p>There is no more picturesque hat for wear with organdie, lace, and linen
    frocks than the garden hat. Large, floppy, straw-body hats laden with flowers
    lend color and atmosphere to summer costumes.</p>
    
    <p class="clear"><strong><em><a href="illust/086.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,523);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/086-t.jpg" alt="Figure 86" width="140" height="152" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em></strong>These body hats may be purchased untrimmed in any good department or millinery
    store. Facings or bindings of georgette, organdie, velvet, or taffeta make
    a more finished-looking hat and give an opportunity for the use of color.</p>
    <h6><strong>Figure 86. Dress Hat of Black Satin with White Top Brim and Trimming
    of White Lilacs.</strong></h6>
    <p>A black garden hat may have a wreath of buttercups, green, yellow, and
      blue wheat, yellow and blue berries, and green and rose apples. If the
    wreath is tied with dull blue ribbon and the hat faced in either green, blue,
      or rose, it may be worn with almost any costume. It is lovely worn with
      any one of its
    own colors.</p>
    
    <p class="clear">If you<strong><em><a href="illust/087.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,723);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/087-t.jpg" alt="Figure 87" width="118" height="171" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em></strong> watch flower coloring you will see that almost any, or all, colors
    in the spectrum may be combined if they are used in the correct shades and
    proportions.</p>
    <h6><strong>Figures 87 and 88. <span class="small">Figures 87 and 88 show the detail of the tie-tack
        stitch used for tacking flowers and feathers. Stems are sewn with ordinary
        stitches.
        The sprays and feathers are caught loosely with a tie-tack stitch.</span></strong></h6>
    <h4 class="clear"><a name="ios" id="ios"></a>ELABORATE OSTRICH TRIMMINGS</h4>
    
    <p>When a hat is to be made with an elaborate ostrich trimming it is easier
    to adapt the hat to the ostrich than vice versa. This does not mean ostrich
    heads or quills or plain bands, for they may be adapted to a hat; but the
      more elaborate ostrich bands and crowns. These come in a variety of shapes,
    styles, and colors.</p>
    
    <p class="clear"><strong><em><a href="illust/089.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,439);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/089-t.jpg" alt="Figure 89" width="140" height="194" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em></strong>When they are used, the designer tries the feathers on various frames, and
    if none is completely harmonious, shapes a frame to make it a fitting background
    for the feathers as well as becoming to the individual.</p>
    <h6><strong>Figure 89. Hat Designed to Fit the Ostrich Trimming.</strong></h6>
    <h4 class="clear"><a name="ipara" id="ipara"></a>PARADISE</h4>
    
    <p>Paradise and aigrettes are the most beautiful of all feathers but they are
    procured in a manner so barbaric that it is inconceivable that any well-bred
    woman would want them.</p>
    
    <p class="clear">Since <strong><em><a href="illust/091.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,335);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/091-t.jpg" alt="Figure 91" width="125" height="231" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em></strong>there <strong><em><a href="illust/090.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,402);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/090-t.jpg" alt="Figure 90" width="140" height="214" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em></strong>is no accounting for tastes, their use must be given space.
      These feathers are so elaborate in themselves that ordinarily a plain hat
      with style of line is the best to
    use for them (see Figure 90).</p>
    <h6><strong>Figure 90. Hat Designed for Trimming of Aigrettes.</strong></h6>
    <h6><strong>Figure 91. Hat Designed in Rust Faille for a Band of Dull Henna
    Aigrettes.</strong></h6>
    <p>For aigrettes, a draped turban with smooth, smart lines, or an irregular
    turned-up brim of soft lines is the best background. These shapes are becoming
    to most people.</p>
    
    <p>For paradise birds (which in themselves are showy but not pretty or artistic),
    a large-brim hat is necessary.</p>
    
    <p>Sprays of paradise feathers, without a head, are as beautiful as their
      source is cruel. Our feminine vanity and love of the beautiful, together
      with a faculty for shutting our eyes to the disagreeable, is what has kept
      them on the market.</p>
    
    <p>Paradise sprays may be used on small or medium-large rolled-brim hats, tiny
    sailors, and turbans.</p>
    <h4><a name="ibg" id="ibg"></a>BURNT GOOSE</h4>
    
    <p>Burnt goose comes in a variety of elaborate forms.</p>
    
    <p><strong><a name="ibg1" id="ibg1"></a>1. Bands</strong> are shaped in circles for the edges of mushroom or upturned brims.
    It is seldom that a frame exactly fits such a band. The band may be slashed
    and lapped slightly or the frame may be cut to fit the band.</p>
    
    <p>Other bands are really frames in themselves and need only have edge folds,
    crowns, and facings added to have finished hats.</p>
    
    <p><strong><a name="ibg2" id="ibg2"></a>2. Fancies. </strong>Burnt-goose fancies are made on shaped forms to give aigrette-like
    effects.</p>
    
    <p>Small brims, irregular, medium-sized brims, and a variety of large brims
    and turbans are used as background for these feathers.</p>
    
    <p><strong><a name="ibg3" id="ibg3"></a>3. Entire crowns</strong> of burnt goose give a variety of lovely effects. These come
    already made in a variety of shapes and colors. Brims of straw cloth, satin,
    velvet, or taffeta are used to mount these crowns.</p>
    
    <h4><a name="icoq" id="icoq"></a>ELABORATE COQ</h4>
    
    <p>Coq makes very handsome small hats for girls and matrons, and dignified,
    handsome, brim hats for matrons.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="icoq1" id="icoq1"></a>1. Bands.</strong> Bands of coq are for side crowns only. The feathers are too long
    for brim bands except where other feathers are used for the edge.</p>
    
    <p><strong><a name="icoq2" id="icoq2"></a>2. Fancies.</strong> Coq fancies are much favored by the French designers and make
    smart, small hats. A small hat with an elaborate use of coq is very smart,
    if not pretty, and highly suited for what is called a dressy street hat.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="icoq3" id="icoq3"></a>3. Crowns. </strong>Crowns of coq are made on plain molds for turbans and on small
    brims for matron hats.</p>
    
    <p>For more elaborate dress hats these crowns come with long coq tails attached
    at side or back, or with smaller coq fancies at the side or front.</p>
    
    <h3><a name="ii" id="ii"></a>II. TRIMMING WHICH IS PART OF THE DESIGN</h3>
    
    <p>This is the type of trimming used for ninety per cent of the hats of today.</p>
    
    <p>Ten or fifteen years ago most of the hats worn were factory made (often of
    fine quality) of straw or velvet. All that the milliner needed to do was
    to sew on trimming, which might be elaborate or simple, according to the
    quality and quantity desired.</p>
    
    <p><em>Today most of the design of the hat is in the making.</em> Trimming is only a
    small part of the design.</p>
    <h4><a name="iiflo" id="iiflo"></a>FLOWERS</h4>
    
    <p><strong><a name="iiflo1" id="iiflo1"></a>1. Single flowers.</strong> Single flowers are used as a finish to dress and semidress
    hats.</p>
    
    <p><em>Rose.</em> Roses are often so beautifully made that to use just one
      is artistic perfection. A single rose may be posed at the side of a soft
      tam crown;
    it may be used on the edge of a shirred fold on a large brim; it may catch
      in the velvet or fabric drape of a matron's turban; be caught to the bandeau
      of a Watteau hat; or be nestled in the lace
    facing of a baby's hat.</p>
    
    <p><em>Gardenia</em>. Gardenias are conventional in shape and appropriate for the more
    or less severe midsummer hats of taffeta and hair. A gardenia at the side
    of a soft crown or at the right-side front of a brim edge is both smart and
    pretty.</p>
    
    <p><em>Handmade flower</em>. The handmade flower is essentially a part of the design
    of fabric and straw hats. Most of the good-looking</p>
    
    <p>handmade flowers for hats are flat. Large handmade flowers are for dresses,
    not millinery. Patterns and directions for making are always given with the
    hat pattern.</p>
    
    <p class="clear"><strong><em><a href="illust/092.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,504);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/092-t.jpg" alt="Figure 92" width="140" height="173" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em><a name="iiflo2" id="iiflo2"></a>2. Sprays of flowers.</strong> Sprays of flowers may be used around a top crown; around
    a side crown; across the back of a brim; on the facing of an upturned brim;
    at the headsize of a brim which is turned up in the back; or on the brim
    of a large dress hat (see Figure 92).</p>
    <h6><strong>Figure 92. Handmade Spray on a Large Dress Hat.</strong></h6>
    <p><em>Rose sprays</em>. These are usually of small roses or of a mixture of a few large
    and a number of small roses. Midwinter dress hats and spring and summer straw
    and hair hats are frequently trimmed with rose sprays. Leghorn and roses
    seem always a happy summer combination.</p>
    <p>Facings usually match frocks and roses in color.</p>
    
    <p><em>Mixed sprays</em>. The better flowers which are made into mixed sprays
      usually have one or more large flowers in the center and a spray of smaller
      flowers extending out on each side. The large flowers serve
    as balance to the arrangement and to hide the stem ends of smaller flowers.</p>
    
    <p>In making these sprays, assemble two small sprays which are a pair. Cut the
    extra stem ends off. Join the ends of the two sprays together and fasten
    the larger flowers, or flower, over the joining.</p>
    
    <p><em>Metallic flowers</em>. Metallic flowers are used to trim late fall and early winter
    dress hats of velvet brocade, satin, and tinsel cloth. These come already
    arranged in sprays.</p>
    
    <p>More elaborate sprays may be made like the mixed sprays, as directed in the
    paragraph above. Grapes, roses, berries, and small flowers are used with
    a few thistles, roses, poppies, and unknown flowers.</p>
    
    <p><em>Handmade sprays and wreaths</em>. Handmade flowers may be used for either sprays
    or wreaths.</p>
    
    <p>Instead of being made into wreaths or sprays and sewed onto the hat, they
    are sewed onto the hat separately in a wreath foundation. This is because
    extra stemming, such as ready-made flowers have, would make the hat heavy
    and give extra work which has no value. Patterns and directions for handmade
    sprays and wreaths are given on all hat patterns where they are used.</p>
    <h4><a name="iife" id="iife"></a>FEATHERS</h4>
    
    <p>Feathers are often used on dress hats to give point to the design of the
    hat.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="iife1" id="iife1"></a>1. Ostrich heads. </strong>Ostrich heads, correctly posed, may be made the most sophisticated
    finish for the design of a dress hat. An ostrich head is the head or tip
    end of a full ostrich plume.</p>
    
    <p>Rain-proof finishes have been so perfected that ostrich feathers are now
    more satisfactory than ever.</p>
    
    <p>Blended shades of ostrich used on a velvet hat of two tones is artistically
    satisfying.</p>
    
    <p>For example, a Gainsborough hat may be of violet velvet faced in wistaria
    and trimmed in two ostrich heads the fibers of which are dyed blue and wistaria.</p>
    
    <p>There is no more artistic trim for the large, black hat than clustered ostrich
    heads; not huge, sweeping, willow plumes, but graceful, nodding ostrich heads.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="iife2" id="iife2"></a>2. Paradise. </strong>Small sprays of paradise may droop gracefully</p>
    
    <p>from the folds of a draped turban to give a wide, soft frame for the face.</p>
    
    <p>In a picture hat they accentuate the sweeping line of a wide brim.</p>
    
    <p>In a medium brim with curves they have all the grace of the old cavaliers'
    hats.</p>
    
    <p><strong><a name="iife3" id="iife3"></a>3. Aigrettes.</strong> Aigrettes make the finishing trim on draped and semidraped
    hats of velvet, satin, hair, haircloth, tinsel cloth, and brocade.</p>
    
    <p>The hats may be turbans or have large or medium brims. </p>
    <p><strong><a name="iife4" id="iife4"></a>4. Fancies made of
      ostrich  fiber, as:</strong></p>
    <p><em>Bands</em>. Ostrich is sewed and glued onto shaped bands to make trimming
      for dress hats. These come in bow shapes, in crescent shapes to fit into
      the curve of a brim, and in rosette
    shapes.</p>
    
    <p><em>Flowers</em>. Ostrich flowers are usually round in shape, giving a
      morning-glory or rose effect. They make soft, unusual trimming finishes
      for the large hats of exaggerated shape and style.</p>
    
    <h4><a name="iiem" id="iiem"></a>EMBROIDERIES</h4>
    
    <p>Embroidery of every sort has been, and is still very popular for dress hats.
    It is fundamentally part of the design of the hat. Entire crowns and entire
    facings are solidly embroidered.</p>
    
    <p><strong><a name="iiem1" id="iiem1"></a>1. Silk floss.</strong> Embroidery floss is seldom used alone to make the embroidery
    on a hat. It is used in combination with nail heads, bugle beads, wooden
    beads, chenille, tinsel thread, or ribbonzene.</p>
    
    <p class="clear"><strong><a name="iiem2" id="iiem2"></a>2. Appliqu&eacute; <em><a href="illust/093.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,366);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/093-t.jpg" alt="Figure 93" width="140" height="236" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>materials<em><a href="illust/094.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',455,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/094-t.jpg" alt="Figure 94" width="220" height="120" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em> in design. </strong>Appliqu&eacute; in elaborate designs of conventional
    lines in Chinese-embroidery motifs or in intricate, all-over patterns makes
    handsome dress hats.</p>
    
    <p>Duvetyn and suede cloth, velvet, broadcloth, and heavy silks are used
      for this. The edges are finished with couching or blanket stitching of
      embroidery floss, yarn, or tinsel.</p>
    
    <p>Beaver cloth is used in appliqu&eacute; design on felt hats. The edge is caught
    down with yarn, chenille, or beads in harmonizing color.</p>
    <h6><strong><a name="fig93" id="fig93"></a>Figure 93. Design Showing Applique of Fabric and Honeycomb Design
    of Ribbonzene.</strong></h6>
    <h6><strong>Figure 94. <span class="small">Figure 94 shows the stitches for honeycomb all-over
        embroidery.</span></strong></h6>
    <p><strong><a name="iiem3" id="iiem3"></a>3. Ribbonzene.</strong> Ribbonzene is used alone in honeycomb, all-over designs and
    in combination with cr&ecirc;pe folds, tinsel braid, chenille, yarn, and floss.</p>
    <p class="clear"><strong><a name="iiem4" id="iiem4"></a>4. Tinsel thread.</strong> Tinsel embroidery thread imparts richness
      of color as well as design. It is rarely used alone but combined with floss,
      ribbonzene, Chinese embroidery, medallions, Chinese gold twist,
    tinsel ribbon, or beads.</p>
    <h6 class="clear"><strong><em><a href="illust/095.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,283);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/095-t.jpg" alt="Figure 95" width="100" height="226" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Figure 95.

    <p class="clear"><strong><a name="iiem5" id="iiem5"></a>5. Tinsel-ribbon embroidery.</strong> Tinsel ribbons are made in lovely designs of
    solid tinsel and in combination with colored silk or fiber.</p>
    <p>These ribbons laid flat on the hat and caught at curve or turn by tinsel
    thread make rich and lovely effects.</p>
    
    <p>Solid turbans and facings are embroidered in conventional line and flower
    designs of these ribbons.</p>

<h2>  CHAPTER II&#8212;MOLDED FRAMES</h2>
<h3><a name="i" id="i"></a>I. MOLDED OR PRESSED FRAMES</h3>
    <h4><a name="ipro" id="ipro"></a>PROCESS OF MANUFACTURE</h4>
    <p>The original model for a pressed frame is a wire frame made by the designer
    (see <a href="m-01.html#i">Chapter I, section I</a>). A model which is to be used for a manufacturer's
    mold must be a very firm frame closely braced, with any roll or bend perfectly
    outlined. For an irregular shape an extra, straight brace is usually added
    between each of the eight ordinarily used, making sixteen straight brace
    wires. The round braces should be about &frac12; inch apart.
    </p>
    <p>    The wire model now goes to the molding room, where the block makers
    make a plaster cast or mold from it.
    </p><p>From the plaster cast a wooden mold is
        whittled or carved. This wooden block is kept in stock, as it may be
      used for shaping straw shapes as they are
    sewn by makers before sizing and blocking.    
    </p><p> From the wooden block an hydraulic
        steel die is made. This consists of two forms, upper and lower, which
      fit together like an acorn in its cup.
    </p><p>In making the pressed frame buckram or net is soaked in water or a sizing
      solution and stretched over the heated lower steel die. The top half of
      the die is clamped down over it and left until the frame material is thoroughly
      dry. At least two men are required to operate this die, or press machine.
    </p><p>After the frame is pressed, the rough edges extending beyond the die must
      be trimmed, the headsize cut out, and the edge wired and bound by machine.
    </p><h4>
    <a name="icost" id="icost"></a>COST OF MANUFACTURE</h4>
    <p>Pressed crowns are made in much the same way as brims. After all the expensive
    process of mold-making, two men are required to operate the machine on which
    the frames are pressed. On the average, the first frame made on an hydraulic
    die costs from $300 to $600. It may readily be seen that an enormous number
      of frames must be sold before the original cost is covered. In other words,
      the thousands
    of frames that must be sold from one die tend to make the shape a common
    one. Producers of exclusive millinery prefer to make hand-molded frames or
    to change the shape of the French frame in order to differentiate it.</p>
    <h4><a name="iadv" id="iadv"></a>ADVANTAGES
      OF USING A PRESSED FRAME</h4>
    <p> There are a number of advantages in using a
        pressed frame. Much expensive labor is saved. It takes almost as much
      time to prepare a hand-blocked frame as it takes to make the hat. The cost
      factor
        to the hat manufacturer is much less for a machine frame. The machine
      frame will stand more unskilled handling than a hand-molded frame. The
      pressed
    frame has a smoother and more finished appearance than a handmade frame.</p>
    <p>To
        the uninitiated home milliner the hand-modeled frame often seems unfinished
      and imperfect. They see the rough-appearing surface rather than its beauty
    of line.</p>
    <p>Pressed frames may be purchased from the millinery departments
        of the large department stores, from the better of the 50&cent; and $1 stores,
        and from many
      of the mail-order houses.</p>
    <h4><a name="iadj" id="iadj"></a>ADJUSTMENT OF PRESSED FRAME</h4>
    <p>The average pressed shape should be purchased
    with the idea of changing it to suit the individual before using it.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="i1" id="i1"></a>1.
        To adjust the headsize. </strong>The headsize may be made larger by slashing
        the brim from headsize to edge and inserting a piece of buckram or elastic
      net. Rip the edge binding and the wire where it is lapped. Pin in the necessary
      piece of material. Try on the frame. Adjust the size. Bend the set-in piece
      at the headsize as the frame headsize is bent. Sew the seams firmly by
      machine
      or with a tight backstitch. Replace the edge wire with binding. To make
        the headsize smaller rip the binding and edge wire
    joining. Slash from edge to headsize and lap until the headsize fits. If
    the frame is a great deal too large, two slashes&#8212;one at the front
    and one at the back&#8212;are necessary. Too much lapping will throw the
    frame out of shape.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="i2" id="i2"></a>2. To make a mushroom from a sailor.</strong> To make a mushroom
      from a straight sailor brim cut the brim at the back and front from edge
      wire to headsize, ripping
      the edge binding and edge wire. Make a seam which laps very little at the
      headsize, but a great deal more at the edge. Taking from the edge and not
      from the headsize is what gives the mushroom effect. Trim some width of
      brim
    from the front and more from the back. The conventional mushroom needs to
    be proportionately narrower in front than a sailor, because when a frame
    droops it hides the face. <strong><a href="illust/008.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,670);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/008-t.jpg" alt="Figure 8" width="171" height="195" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>A narrow back (see Figure 8) is always better because,
    first, a wide drooping effect makes thick-looking shoulders, and, second,
    because it interferes with comfort by knocking against coat collars, car
    windows, and seat backs.</p>
    <h6><strong>Figure 8. To Make a Poke Brim from a Mushroom Frame.<span class="small"> Illustration
          <em>a</em> is a plain mushroom brim from which a poke may be cut. In <em>b</em> note
          the lapped seam <em>C</em> and the dotted line <em>A B</em> for cutting
          the front.</span></strong></h6>
    <p class="clear"><strong><a name="i3" id="i3"></a>3. To make a poke from a mushroom.</strong> This process is
        much the same as above, because the frame is already mushroom. Rip the
        binding and edge wire. Cut
      the back from edge to headsize. Slant the seam so that the edge laps from
    one to two inches and the headsize laps only &frac14; inch.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="i4" id="i4"></a>4. To use a pattern
      on a pressed frame.</strong> Many of the mushroom-hat patterns may be cut
      from an ordinary pressed-sailor or mushroom frame. Cut off the
    headsize slashes of the pattern on the line marked &quot;headsize.&quot; Pin
    the pattern onto the mushroom brim. Mark the correct edge and cut.</p>
    <p>This does
      away with the necessity of wiring a headsize and with the bother of looking
      for correct frame material. The original edge binding may be replaced.
      Silk brace wire is more satisfactory for the edge wire. Poke patterns may
      be cut from mushroom frames in the same way. The important thing is to
      get the same slant and the same proportion as the hat pattern so that the
      same
      pattern may be used to cut the hat materials.</p>
    <h3><a name="ii" id="ii"></a>II. HAND-MOLDED FRAMES</h3>
    <h4><a name="iivar" id="iivar"></a>FRAMES OF VARIOUS MATERIAL STRETCHED ON WIRE </h4>
    <p>There
          are a number of frame materials that may satisfactorily be used for
      stretching frames. The ones
        most used are willow, buckram, jockey, elastic net, rice net, and crinoline.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="ii1" id="ii1"></a>Willow:</strong>      See <a href="m-01.html#i">Chapter
    I, section I</a>.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="ii2" id="ii2"></a>Buckram:</strong> See <a href="m-01.html#i">Chapter
    I, section I</a>.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="ii3" id="ii3"></a>Jockey:</strong> See <a href="m-01.html#i">Chapter
    I, section I</a>.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="ii4" id="ii4"></a>Elastic net:</strong> See <a href="m-01.html#i">Chapter
    I, section I</a>.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="ii5" id="ii5"></a>Rice net</strong> is a frame material which is as much a net as wire window screening.
      A thread net held together by sizing (or starch) would properly define
      it. Cape net is the same thing with finer mesh. Rice net is used for stretching
      soft crowns and for small brims of very soft ribbon or braid sport hats.
      It makes a softer frame than elastic net. It is sometimes used with a thickness
    of crinoline.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="ii6" id="ii6"></a>Crinoline</strong> is used to stretch soft tam crowns, baby hats, old
        ladies' bonnets, and with rice net for larger hats. When crinoline and
        rice net are used together
      the two materials are stretched one over the other, pinned separately,
      but dried and removed together. The sizing sticks them together so that
      they
      hold nicely.</p>
    <h4><a name="iis" id="iis"></a>PROCESS OF MAKING A STRETCHED FRAME</h4>
    <p><strong><a name="iis1" id="iis1"></a>1. Soaking frame fabric in water. </strong>The
        first step in stretching a hand-molded frame is to soak the frame material
        to be used. Each of the fabrics mentioned
      under section II of this chapter has a great deal of sizing.</p>
    <p>This needs
        only to be wet to become pliable. Then it may be stretched over any desired
    frame and it will dry in that shape.</p>
    <p><strong><a href="illust/009.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,736);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/009-t.jpg" alt="Figure 9" width="200" height="168" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a><a name="iis2" id="iis2"></a>2. Pinning frame fabric to the wire
        frame. </strong>Start pinning at the front on the edge wire. Use a bias corner
      of the willow. Pin to first one side of
      the brim, then to the other. Smooth the wet fabric over the wire frame,
      adding first a pin at the edge wire, then one at the headsize. Cut out
      a small headsize
      circle. Slash the material at the headsize to the lower headsize wire at
      intervals of &frac12; inch. Do not slash below the lower headsize wire. Smooth
      all fullness out by pulling it out at the edge and headsize and pushing
      it
      backward to the seam.</p>
    <p>Trim the headsize slashes, leaving only enough to
        pin over the top headsize wire.</p>
    <p>Do not bend the material over the edge wire. Allow it to extend beyond
    the wire. Place pins at intervals of one inch.</p>
    <p>Be careful not to pull the
        frame too tightly between the straight brace wires,
      or the edge wire will lose its contour. There will be an angle on each
    straight brace at the edge wire.</p>
    <p><strong><a href="illust/010.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',422,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/010-t.jpg" alt="Figure 10" width="200" height="128" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a><a name="iis3" id="iis3"></a>3. Drying frame fabric on the frame.</strong> Hang
        the stretched frame up to dry above a hot radiator or in a window, if
      you want it to dry quickly. A good idea
      for class work is to stretch the frames in one lesson that are to be used
      for the next day. Then they may stand overnight. A frame must be thoroughly
      dried before it is removed from
    the wire mold.</p>
    <h6><strong>Figure 10. Original Frame. A Rolled Brim Made from the Dimensions
        Given in <a href="m-01.html#iv">Chapter I, Section IV</a>.</strong></h6>
    <p class="clear"><strong><a name="iis4" id="iis4"></a>4. Removing fabric frame from the mold. </strong>When the frame is thoroughly
        dry, mark edge wire, headsize wire, and seam with a pencil. Pull out
      the pins
      from edge and headsize. Place them in a separate box to be used for frames
      only. The starch on them will mark silk or velvet. Loosen the frame carefully
      at both edge and headsize. Remove
    a little at a time so as not to stretch it out of shape. Trim the back seam
    and lap it as it was marked if the headsize is the correct size. The headsize
    may be adjusted as for a pressed brim (see <a href="#i">Chapter II, section
    I</a>).</p>
    <p>Cut headsize
      and wire edge at the pencil mark.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="iis5" id="iis5"></a>5. How to give variety to shapes stretched
      on the same frame. </strong>If a wire mold has a good headsize roll as
      well as a becoming brim line, it may be changed in a variety of ways.</p>
    <p>The<strong><a href="illust/012.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',347,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/012-t.jpg" alt="Figure 12" width="220" height="90" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong> brim
        <strong><a href="illust/011.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',331,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/011-t.jpg" alt="Figure 11" width="220" height="86" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>may be merely cut smaller. It may be slashed at the side, or it may be
        cut to give an entirely different effect (see illustration, Figures
      11 and 12).</p>
    <h6><strong>Figure 11. The Same Frame Made into a Tricorn.</strong></h6>
    <h6><strong>Figure 12. The Frame Made into a Square-Edge Tricorn.</strong></h6>
    <p class="clear"><strong><a name="iis6" id="iis6"></a>6. To wire a frame. </strong>For the headsize, cut a half-inch bias band
        of dry frame material. Join this in a circle the same size as the brim
      headsize. Wire the lower headsize with brace wire, using a blanket stitch.</p>
    <p>Lap
        the ends of the wire two inches.</p>
    <p>Shape the circle of frame material and wire into an oval.</p>
    <p>Slip this over
      the brim headsize with the unwired edge up.</p>
    <p>Sew the oval to the slashes,
        using two rows of backstitching, one just above the wire and one at the
    top edge.</p>
    <p><strong><a href="illust/013.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',564,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/013-t.jpg" alt="Figure 13" width="200" height="136" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></strong>Straighten the wire for the edge by running the thumb and forefinger
        over it lengthwise, using the cushion part of the finger, not the tips.
        When the
      curve is thus worked out of the wire, buttonhole it to the top edge of
      the frame (edge-wire <a href="m-03.html#fig18">Figure 18</a>), taking very tight stitches about three
      fourths
      of an inch long and only one sixteenth of an inch in from the edge. Lap
      the ends of the wire two and one-half inches and sew down firmly.</p>
    <p>Bind the
        edge with a three-fourths-inch bias strip of muslin or flannel. Sew with
      long, tight, running stitches and stretch.</p>
    <h6><strong>Figure 13. Finishing the Headsize with Ribbon Wire.</strong></h6>
    <h3><a name="iii" id="iii"></a>III. BIAS DRY-MOLDED FRAMES    </h3>
    <h4><a name="iiim" id="iiim"></a>WHEN FRAMES MAY BE MOLDED THIS WAY</h4>
    <p>If a frame turns up straight from the
        face instead of flaring out in a wide brim, there is less sewing in fitting
        the material. Often a bias may be stretched
      to fit it. A chinchin sailor, a rolled sailor, and many turbans may be
    stretched from a bias of elastic net, soft willow, or double crinoline.</p>
    <p>If
        a frame can be stretched without wetting the material, the process is
      not only much shorter, because of the soaking and drying process eliminated,
      but it is much more tidy. The soaking method necessitates the use of many
      thicknesses of newspaper or rubber work-aprons to protect dresses from
      wet
      frame materials.</p>
    <h4><a name="iiip" id="iiip"></a>PROCESSES</h4>
    <p><strong><a name="iii1" id="iii1"></a>1. Frame molding in the hand.</strong> There are wonderful possibilities
        for making rolled brims in the hand without a mold. Make a half-inch
      willow headsize
      band as for a stretched frame, or use a band of ribbon wire. Sew one edge
      of bias elastic net (the width determined by the height or width of the
      hat brim) inside the headsize. Curve the bias upward as you sew and crowd
      the
      material close to make it roll. Elastic net is preferable, but soft willow
      answers the purpose. If width at the sides is desired, or a pointer decided
      angle anywhere, cut the bias and lap it two or three inches at the headsize,
    allowing it to flare to a small seam at the edge.</p>
    <p><strong><a href="illust/014.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',428,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illust/014-t.jpg" alt="Figure 14" width="220" height="115" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a><a name="iii2" id="iii2"></a>2. Dry molding over a
        frame </strong>(see Figure 14). Bias net or willow may be stretched over wire
      molds without soaking, whenever the curve of the frame is such
      that there is no fullness left, or whenever the angle up from the face
      is very decided. Often this means more than one seam. The extra seams are
      usually
      on the brim angle. The stretching, removing, and wiring process is the
      same as for a wet frame (see <a href="#ii">section II</a>, of this chapter).</p>

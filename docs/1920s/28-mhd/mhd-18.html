  <h3>    <a name="making" id="making"></a>Making the Sailor Hat</h3>
  <p>Until now, you have been taught the various methods of making frames, covering
    frames, correct trimmings, and all other important phases of construction.
    Now you are ready to put your knowledge to the test&#8212;to make an actual
    hat.</p>
  <p>We will begin with the sailor hat, for if you are able to make a smart,
    well-fitting, attractive sailor hat you will be able to make any other type.
    To make the lesson easier and less complicated for the student, we will pretend
    that the frame is already made, or bought.</p>
  <p>When covering the flat sailor shape, several important points of construction
    must be considered. In the first place, we must examine the shape itself
    to see that the buckram is not broken, that it is well wired and bound, that
    the edges are bound with bias crinoline. You remember that the complete method
    of making the buckram frame is taught in an earlier lesson. Refer back to
    this lesson if you have any doubts whatever as to how the frame for the sailor
    shape should be made. If you have a frame ready, but it is slightly broken
    from handling, the broken places can be shaped as well as possible and given
    a coat of shellac to keep them firm and strong.</p>
  <p>Always remember that if your shape is covered with velvet, the velvet must
    be so put on that the nap runs from the front towards the back. There are
    no exceptions to this rule whatever. Unless the velvet is applied in this
    manner, it will not wear well. The life of the hat is actually cut in half.
    It is wise, in purchasing velvet for a hat, to choose that type of velvet
    that does not show finger prints. Otherwise you are likely to have trouble
    both in the making and in the wearing of the hat.</p>
  <p>1. In covering the brim, first find the straight lengthwise thread of the
    material and place it on the brim with the thread running from front to back.
    Pin in place.</p>
  <p>2. Now find the crosswise thread and pin this to the hat with this thread
    running crosswise.</p>
  <p>3. The four points where you have pinned your material are center front,
    center back, right and left sides of the hat.</p>
  <p>4. Proceed to pin your material to the four points exactly between the points
    just mentioned. The material should not be stretched, but it must lay perfectly
    smooth and flat. Stretching the material will very likely draw the buckram
    shape and spoil the hat.</p>
  <p>5. Your material is now correctly pinned in place for the covering of the
    upper side of the hat brim. Turn the work over so that the velvet is down
    and proceed to cut, allowing 1/2 inch all around the edge for finish.</p>
  <p>6. Turn over the edge and catch-stitch to the binding. Use your thumb for
    turning it over the edge, being careful that the edge is not stretched. Do
    not allow the stitches to go through to the face of the velvet as this mars
    your work and indicates poor workman ship.</p>
  <p>7. Your binding may be too narrow. In this case, use a diagonal basting
    stitch with the needle pointing to the edge of the hat. These stitches should
    be about 3/8 of an inch apart.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illus/18-01-fig1.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,709);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/18-01-fig1-t.jpg" alt="Figure 1. Making headsize" width="230" height="197" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>8. With your velvet in place, perfectly flat and smooth, you are ready to
    mark your headsize through from the buckram shape to the velvet. Use
    basting for this purpose, running the needle from the right side to the wrong,
    and then from the wrong side to the right. Allow it to pass straight up and
    down through both materials.</p>
  <p>9. You may find that your velvet does not lay flat at the edge but ruffles
    the least bit where it is turned over the brim edge to the under side. If
    so, clip the edge slightly in places just enough to allow the velvet to lay
    perfectly flat and smooth.</p>
  <p>The covering of the flat sailor shape is not difficult, but it demands care
    and practice. The brim is probably the most difficult part of the work, but
    once you have mastered it you will never have any trouble no matter what
    type of brim you may have to cover. Do not leave this part of the lesson
    until you are positive that your brim is correctly covered. Rather go slowly
    and do things correctly, than hurry through the course and be forced to refer
    to the lessons constantly.</p>
  <h3><a name="facing" id="facing"></a>Fitting the Facing</h3>
  <p>The next step in the making of the sailor hat, is the fitting of the facing.
    This must be very carefully done.</p>
  <p>1. First make a paper pattern of your hat. This pattern should be exactly
    the same shape as the brim, but with one-half inch (or a little more if a
    flange edge is to be made) allowed on the edge.</p>
  <p>2. Be very sure that the grain of the material to be used for the facing
    is the same as the grain of the material used on the top of the brim.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illus/18-02-fig2.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,592);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/18-02-fig2-t.jpg" alt="Figure 2. Applying facing" width="241" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>3. Place the facing on the underside of the brim, pinning it in place with
    the eight pins exactly as you pinned the upper part in place. All pins should
    point towards the center of the hat.</p>
  <p>4.	Be careful not to stretch the outside of the facing.</p>
  <p>5. To apply the flange edge, cut a piece of brace wire long enough to go
    around the edge of the brim, allowing a few extra inches.</p>
  <p>6. Place the wire under the edge of the facing and slip the edge of the
    velvet underneath this wire.</p>
  <p>7. Now place a pin under the wire, catching the binding and the underturning
    of the velvet, and work around the hat in this manner. The pins should be
    1 1/2 inches apart. Work from the center of the front to the center of the
    back both in pinning and in sewing. But the joining of the wire must come
    exactly at the center back. </p>
  <p>8. Hold the brim with the facing toward you. Then thread your needle with
    thread matching the material being used and bring the needle point up under
    the wire and through the covering where it is turned over the edge of the
    hat.</p>
  <p>9. Catch it in the turning of the covering with a small back stitch and
    bring the needle back through the facing.</p>
  <p>10. Now take a short stitch on the facing side, very close to the wire,
    and bring the needle back through to catch the underturning of the covering
    of the hat.</p>
  <p>11. Once again bring the needle back through to the lining side and continue
    in this way until the center of the back is reached.</p>
  <p>12. Do not sew all around the hat. When you reach the center of the back,
    begin again at the center of the front and work around this side of the facing
    as you have already sewed the other side.</p>
  <p>13. The facing must be sewed down with a lace stitch if no wire is used
    at the edge. Turn the edge of the facing until it is exactly even with the
    edge of the hat. When finished it should look like a plain seam coming on
    the edge.</p>
  <p>14. To make the lace stitch, fasten the thread between the folds of the
    facing and the upper covering of the brim. Take a small stitch under the
    turning of the covering, and then under the turning of the facing. Take a
    few of these stitches, and then draw the thread closely. This &quot;laces&quot; the
    edges together. Your stitches must be very straight and very tiny.</p>
  <p>Have you mastered this part of the lesson? Are you quite sure that your
    work is correctly done, that you can proceed as far as this in the making
    of a sailor hat without referring to the lessons?</p>
  <p>If not, go over the step-by-step directions again, repeat the work, and
    do not be satisfied until your work is perfect. Rather spend a little more
    time on the lesson now, and learn to make the sailor hat right, than hurry
    over it haphazardly and be forced to refer to it constantly.</p>
  <p>When you are positive that you have mastered the fitting of the facing,
    proceed with the next step, which is the adding of a bias overlap to the
    brim.</p>
  <h3><a name="overlap" id="overlap"></a>Adding Bias Overlap to Sailor Brim</h3>
  <p>The bias overlap or fold is added before the turned edges of the covering
    and the lining are joined. While this overlap may or
    may not be used just as desired, there are hats that seem unfinished without
    it. Some faces also seem to require a soft finish at the edge of the hat
    brim.</p>
  <p>1.	Cut a bias strip two and one-half inches wide.</p>
  <p>2.	Fold lengthwise through the center.</p>
  <p>3.	Mark the center of this fold.</p>
  <p>4. Match the center of the fold with the center front of the hat so that
    the seam of the joining comes at the center back. Always remember, in hat
    making, that no seam of any kind should appear in the front. Joinings should
    always be at the center back.</p>
  <p>5. Place the raw edges of the fold between the hat and the facing, and stretch
    tightly so that it turns flat to the upper side of the hat.</p>
  <p>6. Fasten on to the edge with basting stitches and attach the facing to
    the hat in exactly the same manner as you would if the over lap were not
    put on.</p>
  <p>7. The overlap may be made as an up-turning or an under-turning lap by stretching
    so that it either stands up from the edge or droops down from the edge. The
    position is regulated entirely by the tension used. If the fold is drawn
    very tightly it will lie flat to the brim, if the tension is not so great
    it will form an upward or downward turning fold at the edge of the brim.</p>
  <h3><a name="covering" id="covering"></a>Covering the Crown</h3>
  <p>You are now ready to cover the crown of your sailor hat. It may be covered
    with any of the crown drapes taught in an earlier lesson. You must determine
    this yourself, in accordance with prevailing style, and with your personal
    requirements. For a sailor hat you may use a round or a straight crown.</p>
  <p>After covering the crown, the crown and brim are joined. The headsize must
    first be cut in the center of the brim as marked before the facing was applied.
    Cut this headsize one inch inside the actual headsize measurement in order
    that enough of the material is allowed to sew to the crown.</p>
  <p>Your hat is now ready to be trimmed and lined. You remember you were taught
    the various types of trimmings. Always bear in mind that the trimming must
    be appropriate, harmonizing, in good taste and becoming. It must suit the
    hat, and suit the wearer. The lining is the finishing touch and should be
    made and applied as previously taught. </p>
  <h3><a name="other" id="other"></a>Covering Other Hats</h3>
  <p>As before mentioned, if you are able to make the sailor hat correctly, you
    should have no trouble in covering any other shapes. If a writer once writes
    a masterpiece, he need have no hesitancy in attempting to write other stories;
    but until he has mastered the technique of writing a simple story, he dare
    not venture to write a complicated romance. It is the same with your work
    in millinery. If you have mastered the making of the sailor hat, you may
    feel confident to proceed with the making of other types of hats; but it
    is a mistake to proceed with your lessons until you are positive that this
    one is mastered as thoroughly and completely as is possible.</p>
  <p>There are a few important points that must be taken into consideration in
    the making of different types of hats. If the shape is a rolled turban, for
    instance, you must remember that the concave side of it must be covered,
    and this covering will have to be pasted on if a smooth covering is to be
    obtained. To do this, cut a bias piece of the material wide enough to cover
    the brim. Paste to the brim with milliner's glue.</p>
  <p>The charm of a rolled turban rests in its soft smooth covering. This covering
    should be smooth but have no suggestion of being stretched or pulled.</p>
  <p>The covering on the concave side has been pasted on and turned carefully
    over the edge of the frame. The convex side has its covering simply stretched
    and finished at the edge and headsize as is the sailor hat brim. Sometimes
    instead of a plain covering a cross or a lengthwise drape is used just as
    the taste of the individual dictates. When the turban is braid covered, the
    braid is often made into wheels or other fancy shapes and these form the
    covering of the brim.</p>
  <h3><a name="exceptions" id="exceptions"></a>Exceptions to the Sailor Hat Rule</h3>
  <p>If you are able to make the sailor hat correctly, you will not have trouble
    with other types of hats. But there are certain exceptions to the rule&#8212;certain
    types of hats that require different treatment, that are differently developed
    than the sailor hat.</p>
  <p>There is the picture hat, for instance, which is rarely twice the same.
    Although it is very similar in shape and construction to the sailor hat,
    it is vastly different in size, use and treatment. Of course, much that you
    have already learned will be of value to you in your experience with picture
    hats.</p>
  <p>The shapes and sizes of picture hats are wide and varied&#8212;but the effect
    to be achieved is always the same. With the picture hat one must achieve
    an attractive and picturesque appearance. It may be simply a clever variation
    of the sailor shape; it may be based on the drooping-brim hat, with just
    a slightly different line or angle to place it in the picture hat class.
    But no matter what the shape of it happens to be, the picture hat must serve
    its purpose of creating a picturesque effect.</p>
  <p>As in all other hats, the tilt in the picture hat should be on the right
    side of the head. The left side may be made wider than the right to give
    a less monotonous effect. To achieve a splendid composition in a hat of this
    type, the color of the hat itself should be in decided contrast to the color
    of the trimmings used. Great care must be taken in every detail of the picture
    hat, for it draws attention to itself more strongly than other hats and if
    it is not correct and attractive it will defeat its own purpose.</p>
  <p>Picture hats intended for winter wear are usually of panne or chiffon velvet,
    brocades, satin and taffeta. Tulle, maline, net, lace, chiffon, georgette
    and taffeta are most popular for the summer picture hat. With the exception
    of taffeta, picture hats made of the summer materials mentioned are transparent
    hats and are made on wire foundations. Many of the summer materials are used
    in the winter, too, but in darker colors. Later we will learn exactly how
    this type of transparent picture hat is made.</p>
  <p>I want to impress upon you that all hats are not made with buckram or wire
    foundations. Sometimes Fashion decrees that the soft hat be worn, and for
    this crinoline is usually chosen for the foundation material.</p>
  <p>It is well to make a paper pattern of the hat to get a general idea of how
    it is going to look and then cut out the foundation material. If crinoline
    is used, it may be handled in much the same way as buckram. It will have
    to be slashed, if the hat is to be turned up or down, or if a molded frame
    is desired, it can be made over a wire mold, as mentioned in an earlier lesson.</p>
  <p>The molding of a frame is not easy for the beginner and it is often found
    more satisfactory to purchase the frame ready made and cover it to suit the
    taste. Of course, it is well to know the different ways of making shapes
    for sometimes it is entirely impossible to purchase just the type of shape
    desired. </p>
  <p><em><a href="illus/18-03-end.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',410,160);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/18-03-end-t.jpg" alt="Silhouette of woman in early 19th century dress" width="72" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>As we all know, Fashion is fickle and a shape that was so popular last year
    is entirely a thing of the past today. However, some day&#8212;perhaps a
    few years from now&#8212;the same shape, slightly changed in one way or another,
    will come back into prominence and then fade away, as before.</p>
  <p>Let us remember that often a hat made of buckram can be copied in a light-weight
    material and be very attractive. Do not be afraid to try any type of hat.
    It is only through experience that we gain confidence.</p>

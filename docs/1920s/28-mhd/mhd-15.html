  <h3>    <a name="color" id="color"></a>Color</h3>
  <p>Now comes the interesting subject of color.</p>
  <p>It is of utmost importance that you have a clear understanding of color
    and color harmony in connection with your work on design. Just as the artist
    must know how to mix his paints to achieve the desired effects, you must
    be able to combine various colors in your hat to create an attractive and
    harmonious whole.</p>
  <p>To be well-designed and well-made a hat should be just right in color, texture
    and line for the woman who is to wear it. After all, a hat may be beautiful,
    but if it is not becoming to the woman who wears it, it loses all its charm.
    To achieve what is commonly known as becomingness we must study color and
    line very carefully.</p>
  <p>When we are planning a hat, for instance, we must consider whether the color
    enhances the color of the hair or not. We must consider whether it is the
    right color for the eyes, the complexion, the rest of the costume. If possible,
    the color should harmonize with the type and the temperament of the wearer,
    for in this way we achieve a true expression of personality.</p>
  <p>We find, therefore, that the shape of the hat and the material used cannot
    of themselves give the charm that we seek. We must combine with both of these
    the correct workmanship and the right color. There is in every girl and woman
    something that is attractive, some one thing that makes the person charming.
    It is one of the duties of the hat to enhance this particular feature and
    so conceal those features that are not quite as attractive.</p>
  <p>There is so much to say about color; yet in order to get to the very bottom
    of the subject it would be necessary to use some very technical terms and
    some more or less complicated material. I do not think the majority of my
    students would care to go into the subject of color in exactly that way.
    To some it might be rather tedious reading and I do not want anyone to say
    that my lessons are dry and uninteresting.</p>
  <p>I believe most people who are taking this training want to study color as
    they would any other interesting subject, for in this case they want to be
    able to choose the correct colors when making their own pretty clothes. Of
    course, if one can combine colors well in the selection of clothing, it will
    not be difficult to apply it to the redecoration of the living room, selecting
    material for draperies, glass curtains, fancy pillows and little things that
    help to make a house a real home.</p>
  <p>The main object of color in a costume is to obtain a beautiful combination,
    which will grow more so the longer one looks at it. One problem is to get
    good color combinations in the use of materials, for texture is as important
    as color.</p>
  <p>Few of my students, while making their own clothes, think of themselves
    as artists. Let us stop a minute&#8212;every time you make a new dress aren't
    you trying to make yourself just as attractive as you possibly can? If the
    dress is to be worn in the morning, while you are doing your housework, I
    am sure you want to look just as nice as any of your friends. Every woman
    has a natural inborn pride and, of course, wants to look her best. If it
    is a dress to be worn to the office, you would be widely different from most
    people if you did not want to present a good appearance. Please do not misunderstand
    me and think I mean expensively dressed, indeed, I do not mean that at all,
    just neat and attractive without being overdone.</p>
  <p>When you plan a dress or blouse you are building a picture in which, just
    as in a painted picture, or in a large building, designed by some famous
    architect, the lines and color must be well organized, rhythmically balanced,
    proportionate and fitting the purpose intended.</p>
  <p>It is the proper choice in the putting together of color effects that you,
    as an artist in dress, will and must reveal in order to be a real success.
    The painter does not grind his own color, nor does he prepare his own canvas.
    As we all know, the colors he works with have a range of light and dark.
    To be sure these colors are limited compared to the beautiful colors furnished
    to us by nature, but it is up to him to use his man-made colors to the best
    advantage. The same applies to you, for you do not dye the materials, nor
    do you have a thing to do with the different processes through which it must
    go before it is woven into cloth. However, you must use your own good judgment
    and combine these colors in exactly the right way. So you see it is within
    the power of all of us to reveal character and taste.</p>
  <p>You will find it a real help in analyzing the color schemes, if you will
    watch your friends or people you see in the street cars, trains, or on the
    street. Select some fairly well-dressed woman and judge her clothes as to
    color, keeping in mind whether or not the colors she has chosen go well with
    her particular type and figure. How could this woman improve her looks? By
    choosing another color as trimming could she be made to look more attractive,
    more pleasing to the eye?</p>
  <p>Oftentimes the color scheme is harmonious in itself but will nevertheless
    violate the sense of harmony because it is not suitable to purpose. Well-chosen
    colors may look well on one type of person, but the same well-chosen color
    may be very much out of place on this woman's sister who is light instead
    of dark. The colors which would look well on a tall, slim woman, who can
    rightly wear the broad collar, broad sash, elaborate border designs, would
    not be at all proper for the short, stout woman.</p>
  <p>I am sure you can think of many examples along this line.</p>
  <p>The age of the person plays some part in the selection of a hat, also the
    kind of a function at which the hat is to be worn. The season of the year
    must be considered, not only as to the kind of material but also as to the
    color.</p>
  <p>Perhaps you have seen an elderly woman with very severe features, wearing
    a dainty, much beflowered hat. It is not at all suited to her type, while
    a young girl with rosy complexion could wear this hat, and you would declare
    that it was made particularly for her.</p>
  <p>Another violation as to suitability to purpose is noticed when a very elaborate
    hat is chosen to wear to business. There is really so much room for taste
    and color effects without resorting to the overdone dress for work. In fact,
    a harmony which combines common sense and neatness, with pleasing colors
    chosen in appropriate tones, will do a great deal toward making a favorable
    impression in the business world. Always remember this and pass on the good
    news to your friends, for many a good position has been lost merely because
    the prospect did not look like the quiet, neat, attractive, little lady the
    employer hoped to add to his office force. In this case clothes really did
    talk and regardless of the knowledge the young lady may have had stored away
    in her little head, the fact that she did not know the rules of choosing
    conservative and appropriate colors lost her a mighty fine position. </p>
  <p>It is just these obvious facts which are so often recognized, yet so frequently
    neglected. For these very reasons I hope to give you some hints as to the
    color to be selected and the kinds of colors certain types of people may
    wear.</p>
  <h3><a name="theory" id="theory"></a>A Word on the Theory of Color</h3>
  <p>Colors of objects differ as widely as do their forms. Just as the form or
    shape of an object may be measured, so may the hue, value and intensity of
    the color be measured.</p>
  <h3><a name="hue" id="hue"></a>Hue</h3>
  <p>I want to explain this point thoroughly so you will understand exactly what
    hue means. It is so very important that each color word be kept in its proper
    place for unless it is, the study of color will be of little value to us.
    By hue we mean the name of the color such as red, yellow or blue. The difference
    in the warmth in the color is a variation in hue, or in other words, as red
    changes toward the orange it has become red orange and has changed its hue.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illus/15-01-fig1.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,630);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/15-01-fig1-t.jpg" alt="Figure 1" width="203" height="193" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>There are three fundamental hues&#8212;red, yellow and blue&#8212; which
    are commonly called the primary colors and from these all the other hues
    may be made, if mixed in the proper amounts. The triangle shown in Fig. 1
    indicates the primary colors. Between the corners of the triangle, as for
    example, the red and yellow, additional hues may be inserted, which really
    are the result of the combination of primary colors.</p>
  <p>By the mixing of red and yellow we produce; orange, yellow and blue combined
    gives green; and blue and red makes purple or violet. These colors, green,
    orange and violet are called the secondary or binary colors. As you will
    notice we are developing a color chart and are indicating the secondary colors
    by the second triangle which is placed over the first triangle as shown in
    Fig. 2. In order to produce one of these secondary colors, it is necessary
    that we use the two required primaries in equal amounts.</p>
  <p class="clear">There<em><a href="illus/15-03-fig3.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,630);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/15-03-fig3-t.jpg" alt="Figure 3" width="203" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em> are<em><a href="illus/15-02-fig2.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,527);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/15-02-fig2-t.jpg" alt="Figure 2" width="169" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em> further hues known as the intermediate colors which we obtain
    by mixing equal amounts of a primary and a. secondary and which will fall
    between the points of Fig. 2. Thus we finally have the completed color diagram
    as shown by Fig. 3.</p>
  <p>You will notice that there are three primary colors, three secondary and
    six intermediate. Between each of these hues there are many variations depending
    upon the relative amounts of the primary and secondary colors used in producing
    the particular intermediate hue. All of the commercial colors, such as henna,
    gunmetal, jade and amber, are merely different values of the intermediate
    hues. All such colors may be classified by their position in the color chart
    and described by the name of the hue which they match.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illus/15-04-fig4.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,440);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/15-04-fig4-t.jpg" alt="Figure 4" width="140" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>The color chart shown in Fig. 4 is made by substituting the hues for the
    letters shown at the points of the diagram in Fig. 3. By using the color
    instead of the letters I am sure you will get a much better idea, and this
    chart will be a great help when studying the different points about color.
    Refer to it often and study it carefully.</p>
  <p>The gray tones shown in the center of the color chart will be explained
    later in the lessons.</p>
  <p>Here is another interesting thing about color&#8212;the colors are divided
    into two groups, the warm and the cool hues. Red and orange belong to the
    warmest, blue and purple to the coldest. As we follow around the diagram
    through the green, yellow, green and yellow, the colors become increasingly
    warm. The warm colors are the more pronounced and glaring while we find the
    cool hues are more quiet and reserved.</p>
  <p>The warm colors tend to increase the appearance of size, whereas the cool
    colors reduce the size of the object. This principle is applied in dress
    designing in order to make the large, stout person appear smaller and the
    small, slender person to appear larger. Perhaps you have noticed a very stout
    woman 
    wearing a large figured, warm colored dress. It may be her favorite color
    and material, but at the same time she could decrease her size by wearing
    a cooler color which would be darker, and choosing material which has a smaller,
    less conspicuous design.</p>
  <p>As you might expect, certain colors are more properly used at one season
    of the year than at another. For instance, the appropriate spring colors
    begin with the blue and progress around the color chart toward the yellow
    and continue through the orange for summer, on to the red purple for autumn
    and finally returning to the blue for late winter.</p>
  <p>The warm colors are much more trying on the eyes and nerves, than the cooler
    shades, especially when used to excess. At the same time the very cold shades
    may become depressing if not used in good taste.</p>
  <h3><a name="value" id="value"></a>Value</h3>
  <p>The value of color is the measure of lightness and darkness. At one end
    of the scale is white, showing the greatest amount of light, and at the other
    end of the scale is black. None of the colors shown in the color chart, or
    any of the intermediate colors not shown are as light as white or as dark
    as black, but all fall between these two extremes. The value of any particular
    hue may be determined by properly locating it between extremes of light and
    dark.</p>
  <p>The proper use of color values is of the greatest importance in dress designing,
    for just as the warm or cold hues add to or detract from the appearance of
    size, so do the color values. The lighter values increase the size of an
    object and the darker values have an opposite effect. Doubtless, you have
    been aware of this fact, for white clothing always makes a person look larger
    than does a dark color. By using two colors of nearly the same value, very
    beautiful effects may be obtained, but, of course, this may be carried to
    extremes, and the result would not be pleasing. If a decided contrast is
    wanted, then use colors having entirely different color values. Strong contrast
    of value tends to attract attention and should therefore be used carefully
    in hat design.</p>
  <h3><a name="intensity" id="intensity"></a>Intensity</h3>
  <p>Intensity is the measure of brightness and dullness of a color. As any one
    of the colors of the color chart approaches gray it is
    said to increase in dullness. To produce a neutral gray, two of the complementary
    colors in certain proportions are mixed together. And so you won't be confused
    with all these color words, I am going to tell you that complementary colors
    are those which are directly opposite each other on the color chart. That
    is, violet is the complement of yellow, green the complement of red and so
    on. Refer to Fig. 4 and I am sure you will understand exactly what is meant
    by complementary colors.</p>
  <p>For backgrounds and large areas, colors of lower intensity are preferred
    to the more brilliant shades, as they are much less trying.</p>
  <p>We have discussed the way in which all of the colors shown in the color
    chart in Fig. 4 have been made by combination of the primary hues, with the
    exception of the gray tones shown in the center of the chart. These are most
    important members of the color family, for it is seldom that any of the colors
    in their fullest intensity or brightness are desirable in dress designing.</p>
  <p>When two complementary colors are mixed their intensity is lowered, that
    is, the color is not as bright as any of the colors shown in the outer circle
    of the chart. It is in this way that the gray tones shown in the center of
    the chart are produced.</p>
  <p>There are, of course, innumerable variations of intensity between any two
    of the complementary colors. You will notice that the intensity varies from
    full brightness to complete neutrality at the center and then increases in
    brightness to the full intensity at the outside of the chart. Strictly speaking
    the mixture of the complementary colors in the correct proportions should
    produce pure white, but because the man-made paints or dyes are more or less
    impure, the neutral gray results.</p>
  <p>You may be wondering what this discussion of the intensity of color has
    to do with the problem of hat design. Indeed, it plays a very important part,
    for by knowing that you can emphasize a bit of bright color by surrounding
    it with a dull one of the same hue or by combining the color which you wish
    to bring out with a neutral color, such as white, the desired effects can
    be obtained. It is desirable to soften the intensity of a color and this
    may be done by combining it with a large area of bright color of nearly the
    same hue.</p>
  <p>Be sure that you do not lose sight of the fact that your good taste may
    be more often shown by the intensity of the colors you wear than by any other
    element of your dress. A small person may take much greater liberties in
    the use of colors of nearly full brightness than the large person.</p>
  <p>Before we go to the application of the theory of color to the practical
    problem of color applied to millinery, I would suggest that you review all
    of the lesson up to this point, study carefully your color chart and try
    to find as many colors as possible which you can place between those shown
    in the chart. Try to classify in this way bits of yarn, pieces of silk, colored
    paper, or even silk threads. In this way you will develop your color sense
    so you may recognize quickly and accurately the hue, value and intensity
    of any color or group of colors with which you may have to work.</p>
  <h3><a name="used" id="used"></a>Beautiful Colors Correctly Used</h3>
  <p>In order that you may always have beautiful hats which will be the envy
    of everyone who looks at them and which will increase your natural attractiveness,
    the choosing of colors and the combination of them must be carefully considered.
    When you have learned to do this you will have accomplished one of the most
    important steps in the art of beautiful hat-making. It is just as essential
    to fully understand and make use of the proper application of color in design
    as is the application of any of the other elements of design.</p>
  <h3><a name="types" id="types"></a>Color Types</h3>
  <p>It is quite difficult to lay down hard and fast rules as to the colors which
    different individuals may wear. This may be readily understood, as hardly
    any two people are identical as to color of hair, eyes, skin and general
    contour of features and body. All of these points have a direct bearing on
    the colors which are suitable to be worn. For example, the small, frail,
    flaxen-haired blonde may be ever so attractive wearing certain colors which
    on the blonde of practically the same coloring, but having a very large figure,
    would be most displeasing.</p>
  <p>It will be necessary for you, in applying colors in the making of hats for
    yourself or for others, to study carefully the effect produced by colors
    of different values and intensity in the particular case with which you are
    dealing.</p>
  <p>In the following pages I am going to give a few suggestions as to the colors
    suitable for the more common types, but it must be understood that this cannot
    be applied rigidly in all cases. Frequently you will find that by altering
    the value or the intensity of a certain hue or by combining it with some
    other color in the manner explained earlier in the lesson you will be able
    to produce exactly the effect which you have desired.</p>
  <p>If by chance you have found through your own experience that some one of
    the colors indicated as being suitable for your general type is unbecoming,
    follow the suggestions I have given you in regard to combinations of hues
    or the changing slightly of the value of the color or possibly use one of
    a different intensity, and you will be surprised to find that you have been
    passing up that particular color which is very becoming to you.</p>
  <p>Many people experience difficulty in choosing a hat. Of course, the color
    must be becoming and at the same time be appropriate and go well with the
    wardrobe. Complexion and the color of the hair play a very important part.
    The pale skin must be warmed; the high colored skin must be cooled. At the
    same time the very red shade of hair must be neutralized and the dull shades
    of hair toned up.</p>
  <p>Let us now take up some of the color types and decide just which colors
    are most appropriate.</p>
  <h3><a name="blondes" id="blondes"></a>Blondes</h3>
  <p>In choosing hats the blonde should be especially careful about color. Some
    blondes work by the rules of contrast, that dark colors make their pale coloring
    seem even more delicate. It is commonly believed that this idea really works.</p>
  <h3><a name="fair" id="fair"></a>Fair Hair and Clear Complexion</h3>
  <p>This type of blonde may wear pale gray or pink; rose, brown or white, as
    well as any shade of green, purple or blue. Light
    shades of brown should ordinarily be avoided because it only dulls the hair
    and the complexion. It is well to omit any strong color, except in limited
    quantities.</p>
  <h3><a name="brown" id="brown"></a>Brown Hair and Pale Complexion</h3>
  <p>The colors commonly selected by this type should be blue, blue green, emerald
    and turquoise. Chestnut brown is becoming also wine color cerise and some
    shades of red. Pink is often worn, and shades of violet. Care must be taken
    in selecting shades of green for they are not usually becoming to this type.
    Also avoid gray, yellow or dull brown.</p>
  <h3><a name="golden" id="golden"></a>Golden Hair and High Color</h3>
  <p>Choose buff color and soft tans and combine them with black or a dark shade.
    Gray may be worn, brown, olive green, pale or dark blues, especially in dull
    shades. Beware of all bright shades of any color, and above all avoid bright
    red, blue, pink and yellow.</p>
  <h3><a name="light" id="light"></a>Light Hair and Sallow Complexion</h3>
  <p>This type can wear the brighter colors such as crimson and wine shades.
    Warm browns are becoming, also medium and dark blues. Some of the dull shades
    of green are becoming, and emerald, pink and cerise may be worn in small
    quantities. The following colors should be avoided: dull grays or dull browns.</p>
  <h3><a name="red" id="red"></a>Titian or Red Hair and White Skin</h3>
  <p>Greens in dark and light shades may be chosen; almost any shade of dark
    or light blue is becoming. Rich browns are good, also soft grays; black may
    be worn, also cream and ivory. Beware of bright greens, blues, purples and
    reds.</p>
  <h3>Brunettes</h3>
  <h3><a name="brown" id="brown"></a>Brown Hair and Clear Complexion</h3>
  <p>If this type of person has a fair skin and plenty of color in her cheeks
    she need not be afraid to wear any shade or any color. Of course, if she
    finds according to her own individual type that certain colors are not as
    becoming as others, she should by all means select the most becoming colors.</p>
  <h3><a name="dark" id="dark"></a>Dark Hair, Clear Olive Complexion</h3>
  <p>Providing this type of person has a little color, navy blue, olive and certain
    shades of green will be becoming, as well as cerise, pink, red, maize and
    dark blue. Do not select pale blue or yellows.</p>
  <h3><a name="sallow" id="sallow"></a>Dark Hair and Sallow Complexion</h3>
  <p>Navy or dark blues are good. Browns if a warm brown is selected, dark shades
    of green if relieved by touches of pink. Dark red is becoming, also yellow
    or flame color. Avoid dead shades of gray and brown, also pale yellow and
    blue.</p>
  <p>I hope you have found the study of color interesting, for it is so very
    important. The subject might have been covered in a much more technical way,
    but I believe it is your desire to learn the practical side of the question
    with just enough of the theory so that you may understand why certain of
    the colors go together and make a beautiful hat while others clash so violently.</p>
  <p>The appreciation of color is instinctive with nearly all of us from infancy,
    although sometimes we do not realize it. Color is manifested in all of Nature,
    for though she molds everything into beautiful shades, harmonious as to line,
    perfect as to balance, and with the rhythm of the master hand, without color
    her work would be flat, meaningless and without inspiration. Beauty brings
    happiness to us, makes us more cheerful and life in general more pleasant,
    and nothing contributes more toward beauty than the proper use of color.</p>

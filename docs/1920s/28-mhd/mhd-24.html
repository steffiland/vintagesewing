  <h3><a name="shop" id="shop"></a>Are You Going to Open a Millinery Shop?</h3>
  <p>You can, if you want to. You have all the knowledge you will require for
    making hats that your patrons will be delighted with, and in this lesson
    we are going to show you how to open a shop at a minimum cost. Of course
    you realize that any new project carries with it the necessity for hard work
    and sincere efforts. But granting you are willing to take your work seriously,
    and to progress steadily, your millinery shop will be a success.</p>
  <p>There are many important little problems that must be solved before one
    can successfully run a millinery shop. Salespeople must be employed, letters
    soliciting patronage must be written, furniture must be bought, stock must
    be prepared. It is not easy, but it is fascinating to those who love activity
    and progress.</p>
  <p>First let us consider the salespeople, the employees. They play a large
    part in the success of your little shop, and you must know exactly how to
    employ them, how to keep them, how to inspire their best services. Cooperation
    is a great aid to success, and you can gain the whole-hearted cooperation
    of your helpers if you approach them in the right spirit. Let them think
    they have a share in the success of your organization; inspire them to take
    pride in their handicraft; be courteous and considerate at all times.</p>
  <h3><a name="people" id="people"></a>Concerning Salespeople</h3>
  <p>Always remember that it is poor economy to employ haphazard workers or indifferent
    salespeople. In the workroom they will spoil more material than one can afford,
    and in the salesroom they will turn away many unsatisfied customers. If the
    workroom and salesroom are both properly managed, there will be little loss.</p>
  <p>There are certain so-called &quot;dull seasons&quot; in the millinery profession.
    During these periods, which are usually in the late fall and early spring,
    it is wise to keep your employees busy putting stock in order, taking inventory,
    renovating. It is always best to have enough capital in reserve to carry
    you over the first few dull periods, but if you incorporate a side-line in
    your business you can &quot;push&quot; that side-line while the millinery
    business is at a depression. Many milliners sell attractive little bags,
    pillows, slippers, etc., for gifts during the Christmas and Easter seasons.</p>
  <p>Salespeople should be neatly and seasonably dressed. In the summer neat
    linen frocks are best; in the cooler months dark-colored silk frocks are
    appropriate. Nothing elaborate should be worn, but the salespeople should
    look attractive as very often the patrons will request them to wear the hats
    in order to see how they look.</p>
  <p>Always keep your rooms quiet. Noisy confusion is not compatible with the
    best work. It may be a good plan, also to have a sign conspicuously placed
    in your workroom, reading, &quot;A place for everything, and everything in
    its place.&quot; And always be sure to provide your millinery workers with
    plenty of fashion magazines which they can study in the quest of new style
    ideas.</p>
  <h3><a name="stock" id="stock"></a>Buying Stock and Furniture</h3>
  <p>The first duty that confronts you when you plan a millinery shop is the
    purchase of furniture. Some of the newer millinery shops are decorated in
    gray with hand-painting in blue, rose and other harmonizing colors. Wicker
    furniture is effective, but not very substantial.</p>
  <p>When buying furniture, always take effect into consideration. It is perfectly
    all right to think about cost and about wear, but you will find that your
    customers will appreciate an attractive environment. Besides, what hat doesn't
    look prettier when framed by an attractive mirror in an attractive alcove?</p>
  <p>Talking of mirrors, your shop will require a great many. They may be square,
    oval or oblong, but you should hang them in such manner that they show the
    hat and face only, not the entire figure. This is a psychological fact that
    milliners have learned through experience; a woman will often refuse a hat
    simply because she is disappointed in the appearance of her figure in the
    mirror. Always keep your mirrors clear and spotless by wiping often with
    damp cheesecloth.</p>
  <p>Find out the best place to purchase your furniture. Many firms allow cash
    discounts, and some allow discounts for cash within thirty or sixty days.
    Take advantage of these discounts wherever possible, as they help to a surprising
    degree. Wise purchasing in the beginning will leave you with sufficient surplus
    to tide you over any dull periods that may come.</p>
  <p>When purchasing rugs, remember that a dark rug shows dust and lint more
    readily than lighter colored rugs. Green fades easily, as do light blues
    also. A good weave has a small pattern, while boldly designed rugs may be
    safely interpreted as cheap fabrics. Tans and reds retain their color. </p>
  <p>Purchase your stock wisely. Do not purchase too much buckram and too little
    velvet. Proportion your available capital in such manner that you will have
    enough for everything you need, even if you can purchase only a little of
    each thing. Do not make the mistake of purchasing in the Fall what you will
    be able to sell only in the Summer; be seasonable as well as sensible in
    your selection.</p>
  <p>You will need convenient work-tables for the workroom, wall-pockets for
    odds-and-ends; plenty of equipment for the workers; a chest of drawers in
    which to keep the materials. For the salesroom you will need several attractive
    chairs and a table; chests of drawers; mirrors; trees for hats on display;
    an attractive floor lamp; a cash register. Do not overcrowd your shop, and
    be sure that all the colors harmonize. There is nothing less conducive to
    the purchase of a new hat than surroundings that are inharmonious and in
    poor taste.</p>
  <p>Among other things, you will require hat bags and hat boxes, ledgers in
    which to keep accounts, memorandum and bill pads. You may start in a small
    way, if you wish, and add gradually while your business progresses. But it
    is always best to start out right from the very beginning.</p>
  <h3><a name="importance" id="importance"></a>Of Particular Importance</h3>
  <p>Your credit in business will mean a great deal to you. Without credit you
    will be handicapped. Therefore it is of utmost importance that you work up
    good credit among the people from whom you purchase your supplies.</p>
  <p>For instance, if a month comes when you find that for some unexpected reason
    you cannot meet your bills, your credit will enable you to hold over until
    the next month. But if you have been negligent, if you have the reputation
    of not paying bills on time, credit will be refused you. Therefore you see
    how important it is to build up a good credit while you are new in the business.</p>
  <p>Another important detail to attend to is fire and burglary insurance. Perhaps
    the latter is not entirely essential, but the first certainly is. Your policy
    should be large enough to cover probable loss, and should be kept up-to-date.
    File an annual or semiannual inventory of stock and fixtures with your insurance
    papers, so that adjustment can be made without loss of time or business in
    case of fire.</p>
  <p>You will find it a great help to know the laws pertaining to your business&#8212;both
    State and National. There are, for instance, many laws relating to the plumage
    of birds which you should know. Many beginners are fined because they use &quot;forbidden
    plumage&quot; in their shops. Other similar laws pertaining to your profession
    should be known and observed.</p>
  <h3><a name="up" id="up"></a>Keeping Up-to-Date</h3>
  <p>It is of utmost importance that you keep your stock new and up-to-date.
    Keep posted on all the newest and most popular styles, and make old merchandise
    move off the shelves by means of sales, special offerings, etc. Be sure to
    have all the new styles while they are new for it is then that they bring
    the best prices. The current trade papers will keep you well posted on all
    that is new and up-to-date in your profession.</p>
  <p>Another important thing to remember is that credit is a poor policy in a
    business of any kind. Insist upon cash for everything. Once you gain the
    reputation of extending credit to some of your customers, others will want
    credit also and inevitably you will be a loser.	.</p>
  <p>In making deliveries, have your hats well-packed. If you are careful of
    your merchandise, and treat it with a certain degree of respect, your patrons
    will do likewise. Another psychological truth! The hats that are delivered
    to customers should be packed in neat, attractive boxes bearing the name
    of your shop. Enough tissue paper should be used to protect the hat and keep
    it from crushing. If sent by express or parcel post, the ordinary hat box
    should be enclosed in another of corrugated paper, and the hat should be
    carefully wrapped in tissue paper to prevent its becoming damaged in any
    way.</p>
  <p>Receipts for merchandise delivered should be demanded. No slip-shod business
    methods should be tolerated, as they interfere with your success. Keep careful
    account of expenditures and income; make note of your &quot;best sellers&quot;;
    discard those hats you find by experience do not sell; send letters of thanks
    to your patrons; pay your bills promptly. Only by adhering strictly to these
    rules of good business can you hope to build up a profitable and successful
    patronage.</p>
  <p>You will probably find your first year the hardest. But if you work sincerely
    to build up a good patronage, if you devote yourself entirely and whole-heartedly
    to your profession, if you are at all times courteous, fair and serious,
    your business is bound to progress. And after the first year you will be
    amazed to see how quickly success places itself within your grasp.</p>
  <h3><a name="misc" id="misc"></a>Miscellaneous Hints</h3>
  <p>If you do not have much closet room, and you wish a place in which to keep
    materials out of the dust, make yourself one of these portable closets. It's
    quite easy: Take a two-folder clothes rack and put it in a corner of the
    room. Across the top, in front, fasten a brass rod. It should go from one
    of the uprights to the other. The curtain is applied to this rod. Now cut
    a piece of stiff pasteboard in triangular shape to fit the top and cover
    it neatly with white oil-cloth, binding it around the edges. This is laid
    across the top to keep the dust out. Fasten screw-hooks along the rods, inside,
    to hang the cloth upon. Any material you prefer, cretonne being most appropriate,
    may be used for the curtain, and the whole frame may be enameled in white.
    A portable closet of this type is ideal for the workroom.</p>
  <p>If there is a dark or unsightly window in your salesroom, transform it into
    an attractive little recess for books, magazines, or even for a hat on display.
    Cover the window with an attractive silk curtain to harmonize with the color
    scheme of the room. If you wish, you can first bar the window with a piece
    of cardboard, placing the curtain over it. In this way the window will be &quot;camouflaged&quot; and
    will not make the room appear dingy.</p>
  <p>Chairs and tables sometimes scratch and ruin a hardwood floor. To prevent
    this, cut an old felt hat into tiny squares and paste one square on the bottom
    of each foot.</p>
  <p>Tapestries that have become dull or faded can be brightened by wiping quickly
    with a clean cloth wrung out of a solution of ammonia. Use one part of ammonia
    to twenty parts of hot water. Tapestry furniture should be aired at least
    once a month and the cushions thoroughly brushed to prevent moths from developing.</p>
  <p>Many of my students have opened shops of their own and it is just amazing
    the business that they are doing. As already suggested, many of them have
    put in side lines of lingerie, purses and novelties which sell well and add
    to the attractiveness of their little shop. If the business is well managed
    the rewards are great and the work a real pleasure. If you decide to open
    your own shop be sure to write and tell me about it. And remember that I
    am interested in your success, and will always be glad to help you with advice
    or suggestions
    on your problems. </p>

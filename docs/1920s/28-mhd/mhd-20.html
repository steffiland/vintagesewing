  <h3>    <a name="right" id="right"></a>The Right Hat at the Right Time</h3>
  <p>Now, suppose we discuss the matter of correct hats for various occasions.
    This is a question which will probably arise in your work on millinery, and
    it is best to solve it now.</p>
  <p>Do you know, for instance, the correct type of hat for the afternoon at
    the theatre, for the evening at the hotel, for the Sunday at the beach? Do
    you know when to wear a tailored hat and when a dressy hat? Do you know the
    hat styles for the bride, the widow, the debutante?</p>
  <p>Just as the wrong hat in the wrong season is unattractive, so is the wrong
    hat worn at the wrong time in bad taste. Yet, how many women wear chic little
    creations with dainty feather trimmings on the automobile excursion, when
    they should wear a plain little sports hat! And how many women make the mistake
    of appearing at the theatre or in a restaurant in evening attire with the
    wrong type of headdress!</p>
  <h3><a name="evening" id="evening"></a>In the Evening</h3>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illus/20-01-fig1.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,466);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/20-01-fig1-t.jpg" alt="Figure 1" width="149" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>When one is attired in formal evening dress it is bad form to wear a hat.
    The hair should be dressed high and one may wear a comb or hair ornament&#8212;but
    no hat. If the hair is bobbed, it should be attractively arranged. If one
    is in semi-evening dress, on the other hand, one may wear an attractive hat,
    quite dressy, to harmonize with the rest of the costume.</p>
  <p>With tailored clothes worn in the evening, one may wear a veil, if veils
    are in style. Tailored clothes were at one time appropriate only for wear
    during the day, but now it is considered smart to wear them at all times,
    providing the occasion is appropriate. For instance, when one is traveling
    and spends the evening in a strange city, one may wear a tailored suit to
    the hotel, and with it a tailored hat.</p>
  <h3><a name="morning" id="morning"></a>For Morning Wear</h3>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illus/20-02-fig2.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',588,636);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/20-02-fig2-t.jpg" alt="Figure 2" width="217" height="196" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>For the person who is able to make her own hats, it is possible to have
    hats for every occasion, and at such a saving. It depends somewhat on the
    season as to just what kind of hat is appropriate for morning wear. Usually
    a sports hat of some type is becoming and the kind usually worn. It also
    depends on the occasion. If one is spending one's vacation at a summer place
    or resort a large hat would probably be most appropriate, especially if the
    weather is warm and the sun is shining brightly.</p>
  <p>A small straw hat with a slightly turned brim would be very useful. It could
    be made of novelty braid and effectively trimmed according to the prevailing
    style. If bows are used, 
    these may be applied; if quills are the vogue, a bright-colored one may be
    placed at a becoming angle.</p>
  <h3><a name="afternoon" id="afternoon"></a>For Afternoon Wear</h3>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illus/20-03-fig3.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,463);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/20-03-fig3-t.jpg" alt="Figure 3" width="148" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>In the afternoon, summer or winter, one usually wears a rather dressy hat,
    harmonizing as to style and color with the rest of the costume. If one attends
    a tea party or luncheon, one wears one's prettiest hat and gayest frock.
    A large hat is very appropriate, especially during the summer months.</p>
  <p>If attending a matinee, one dresses according to the season, 
    and wears a hat to go well with the costume. If Fashion decrees a large hat,
      and it looks well on you, by all means wear a large hat. If the close fitting
      hat is the approved kind, then this type should be chosen, providing, of
      course, that it looks well on you, and that it harmonizes with the rest
      of your costume.</p>
  <p>For shopping a neat suit is most appropriate or a pretty, well-made coat
    and dress. The hat chosen is usually small, and whether of light or dark
    material depends on the taste of the wearer as well as on the word of style.</p>
  <p>When traveling it is wise to dress plainly and as inconspicuously as possible.
    If bright colors are chosen great care should be taken that the matter is
    not overdone. The styles should not be extreme, but should be well chosen
    as to durability and occasion. A tweed coat is exceptionally nice for traveling,
    for it does not wrinkle as much as other materials. A felt hat is appropriate
    or a small hat of braid or satin. To complete the outfit, well-selected gloves
    and oxfords must be obtained.</p>
  <p>Garden parties are sometimes held in the afternoon and sometimes in the
    evening. In the evening the hat is often omitted, though it is perfectly
    correct to wear one if desired. The correct thing to wear is a gay colored,
    light dress with a summery hat which is as large as possible
    without being unbecoming.
    Flower-trimmed hats are most
    appropriate for occasions of
this kind.</p>
  <h3><a name="sports" id="sports"></a>Sports Hats</h3>
  <p class="clear">The <em><a href="illus/20-05-fig5.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,594);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/20-05-fig5-t.jpg" alt="Figure 5" width="191" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>sports hat<em><a href="illus/20-04-fig4.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,413);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/20-04-fig4-t.jpg" alt="Figure 4" width="131" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em> is worn a great deal and for many occasions. It is not confined
    to the summer months, as was at one time true. Felt hats are considered the
    true sports hat, though the ribbon and satin hats are also very popular.
    The felt hat, to be sure, is not as cool as other kinds, but nevertheless
    it does not lose its popularity even in the warmest weather. It seems each
    season this kind of hat becomes more
    popular and the styles more varied and attractive.</p>
  <p>During the winter months, the brown and gray felts are worn a great deal,
    as well as the dark greens and, in fact, all dark shades. However, when summer
    comes it is almost impossible to find a color which is not represented by
    some style of felt hat. It is possible to get a felt hat to go with every
    type
    of sports clothes. The hats are made large, small and of various shapes.
    The trimmings are very scant, usually a band around the crown and a tailored
    bow. A quill is sometimes placed at an attractive angle, or a ribbon ornament.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illus/20-06-fig6.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,518);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/20-06-fig6-t.jpg" alt="Figure 6" width="166" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>The sports hat made of quilted satin is smart and attractive. The stitching
    may be of the same color as the hat or a harmonizing color may be selected.
    The
    material is quilted first in the regular way and then cut out and applied
    to the hat. These hats are especially nice to take along when traveling,
    for they may be packed and emerge looking none the worse for wear.</p>
  <p>The ribbon hat, or ribbon and straw, is most attractive and may be made
    of ribbon about the same width as straw braid, and applied in much the same
    way. It will be necessary to gather the edges to make them stay flat, or
    if by chance the ribbon has a cord at the edge it may be gathered the same
    as the braid. This kind of hat is very simple to make and at the same time
    is most attractive.</p>
  <p>The satin or taffeta sports hat is neat, but care must be taken that this
    kind of sports hat is not confused with the hat worn for more dressy occasions.
    The quilted hat is made of taffeta or satin and is really a true sports hat.</p>
<h3><a name="elderly" id="elderly"></a>For the Elderly Woman </h3>
  <p class="clear"> <em><a href="illus/20-07-fig7.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,505);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/20-07-fig7-t.jpg" alt="Figure 7" width="162" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Age has a charm of its own&#8212;a mellow charm that has all
    the beauty of a fading sunset. The elderly woman has a certain
    dignity and repose, a certain
    soft beauty, that the young girl
    in all her gay finery cannot hope
    to rival. With a bit of taste and
    a bit of style, one's grandmother
    can vie with the youngest
    among us.</p>
  <p>Years ago it was commonly
    thought that the elderly woman
    must wear black and, in fact,
    only the dullest of colors. That
    notion has been erased, and now
    the elderly woman can wear the
    gayest sports hats if she desires,
    and she is not criticized for the
    choice. When a person stops
    to think a minute, it really is
    silly to think older people must wear dull colors. Why should
    they? A person is just as old as she feels, and if she longs for
bright, well-chosen colors, why shouldn't she wear them?</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illus/20-08-fig8.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,522);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/20-08-fig8-t.jpg" alt="Figure 8" width="167" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>To be sure, a black velvet hat looks well on some elderly women. A small
    black hat boasting nothing but the delicate tracery of a patterned black
    lace as a trimming is most flattering to the white-haired woman. Of course,
    if one is a bit sallow, the black must be relieved by a little color, either
    in the form of a flower or a touch of ribbon.</p>
  <p>In fact, in this day, the elderly woman has a much larger choice than she
    had years ago. She may select many types of hat and the range of colors is
    unlimited, providing, of course, that she remembers that the
    color of her hair and her complexion plays an important part
the same as with the younger person.</p>
  <p>The elderly lady often prefers to wear a veil whether it is in style or
    out. If this is the case, it must be carefully chosen as to color and material.
    The kind of hat with which the veil is worn must be considered, for all hats
    do not look well with a veil.</p>
  <p>To be sure, the lady along in years usually prefers a small hat with a very
    narrow brim. If she is short, she likes to select a hat with a large crown,
    or one which has the trimming arranged so as to make her look taller.</p>
  <p>For evening wear, the elderly woman should follow the same rules as the
    younger person, that is, choose the type of hat most becoming to her. This
    hat is often made of silk material, and at just the right point to balance
    the symmetry of the face, she should have a bunch of lilacs or other small
    flowers in the summer, or a pretty jet ornament in the winter.</p>
  <h3><a name="young" id="young"></a>For the Young Girl</h3>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illus/20-09-fig9.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,422);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/20-09-fig9-t.jpg" alt="Figure 9" width="134" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Being a young girl has its advantages. One has the whole world of fashion
    to select from. There is the rose-petal hat, so pretty and so youthful, but
    no one but the young girl can wear it. The mushroom must have most certainly
    been created for youth, as well as the poke bonnet and the ever-present sailor.</p>
  <p>However, one must not overstep the bounds of good taste merely because one
    is young. It is still necessary to consider harmony, color, personality and
    the occasion. One must not wear a sports hat to a reception or a real dressy
    creation on a
    shopping expedition. Of what avail is style and personality if one ignores
    the dictates of good form?</p>
  <p>If she is a much-feted individual, she should know exactly what to wear
    to the party, the dance, the tea given in her honor. At the tea she wears
    a pretty frock of taffeta or some other silk
    with as wide and floppy a hat as her height will stand. Of course, this depends
    on the time of the year.</p>
  <p>The close fitting hat is most becoming to the youthful face and is appropriate
    with the suit or coat. A hat of this type is worn for travel or for general
    utility wear.</p>
  <h3><a name="veil" id="veil"></a>The Bridal Veil</h3>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illus/20-10-fig10.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,322);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/20-10-fig10-t.jpg" alt="Figure 10" width="101" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>It is interesting to trace the origin of the bridal veil to its source.
    According to the ancient marriage rites of the Anglo-Saxons a &quot;care-cloth&quot; (a
    square vestment) had to be held over the bride and groom before the marriage
    was considered binding. It was from this custom that the beautiful bridal
    veil of today has grown. Little does the bride realize, as she fondles the
    shimmering folds of her bridal gown and veil, that she is following customs
    that are age-old in their origin!</p>
  <p>The bridal veil changes just the same as hats change. One year one type
    of veil is' worn, while another brings an entirely new kind. Sometimes the
    veil of the bride, which is usually of tulle, falls from the top of the head
    to the hem of her gown, and sometimes to the floor, forming a train. At other
    times it is considered correct to gather the veil into a charming flower-trimmed
    crown at the back of the head and allowing it to fall gracefully to the train
    of the dress.</p>
  <p>The cap effect is often worn and may be arranged in different ways. Tulle
    still remains a favorite veil material. Lace is very beautiful&#8212;especially
    if it is old lace that has been a long time in the bride's family.</p>
  <p>There are so many lovely imported applique veils available, at surprisingly
    reasonable prices, that if there is no heirloom lace veil to be worn, it
    becomes merely a matter of selection. The tulle veil is always pretty and
    has been adopted by many generations of brides in the past, and no doubt
    will be for many generations to come.</p>
  <p>The accessories worn by the bride are mostly of her personal selection,
    or such as may have been received in gifts from her friends. Rosettes of
    lace or tulle with orange blossoms may decorate her high-heeled white satin
    slippers, and her white chiffon silk stockings may have a long lace insert
    at the front of the foot. Pearls are preferred to diamonds (or their imitations)
    for her jewelry. That, also, is a matter of personal choice. The long pearl
    earrings, so often in vogue, are distinctly suitable with the bridal finery. </p>
  <p>It is customary to have orange blossoms or tiny lilies-of-the-valley entwined
    around the crown of the head, with a spray or two nestling in the folds of
    the veil. There are many attractive ways of arranging the bridal veil, but
    it is a question which depends largely upon prevailing style and upon individual
    taste.</p>
  <p>With the going-away suit, or ensemble, one wears a smart little hat which
    harmonizes with the costume. If one is wise in the matter of trousseaus,
    one will most certainly include a chic little sports hat that can be worn
    with the smart sports silk dresses as well as with the sports suit.</p>
  <h3><a name="maids" id="maids"></a>Hats for the Bridesmaids</h3>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illus/20-11-fig11.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',539,624);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/20-11-fig11-t.jpg" alt="Figure 11" width="233" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Large floppy hats are usually chosen by the bridesmaids. They may be trimmed
    with velvet ribbon and flowers, to match the dresses worn by the bridesmaids.
    Horsehair braid in white or pastel shades make very pretty hats, especially
    when combined with lace or maline decorations, and perhaps one single large
    rose on the side, or the shaggy petal effect placed on the under side of
    the brim.</p>
  <p>Sometimes wreaths made of feather flowers are put around the crown of the
    hat, or a wreath made of flowers resembling pink gladioli produce a charming
    effect. Applique designs are charming, especially when the design is made
    of lace dyed to match or harmonize with the dress and carefully sewed to
    the round crown and here and there on the wide brim of the hat.</p>
  <p>Tinted lace, over maline, makes a beautiful transparent hat
    that many bridesmaids are happy to wear. The charming hat is finished with
      shaggy petals matching the sashes of their frocks. In some instances, hats
      of horsehair braid or maline are overlaid with white or tinted applique
      lace. The white hair hats are often wreathed with delicate green maiden-hair
      ferns, having a bunch of orchids or large roses on the right brim.</p>
  <h3><a name="mourning" id="mourning"></a>Mourning Hats</h3>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illus/20-12-fig12.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,303);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/20-12-fig12-t.jpg" alt="Figure 12" width="94" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Grief turns instinctively to the somber garments of mourning. There seems
    to be a certain measure of comfort in the subdued tones of black and white,
    in the unrelieved surface of one's dress. But good taste looks with disfavor
    upon long crepe veils and any other form of mourning that is pronounced,
    or ostentatious.</p>
  <p>The mourning hat should be particularly simple. Any attempt at clever trimming
    or smart line is inappropriate&#8212;yet the hat should be taken to achieve
    a certain amount of individuality. For this reason handsome fabrics and becoming
    lines should be selected.</p>
  <p>A woman in mourning does not wear jewelry aside from the wedding and engagement
    rings. Dull bar pins may be used whenever needed, and a brooch may be worn
    if it is not too ostentatious. Purse, gloves, etc., should be dull black.
    Handkerchiefs may have a black border or they may be pure white.</p>
  <p>As for the rest of the mourning costume, dresses should be of black fabrics
    without a shiny finish. For instance, serge, tricotine, duvetyne, Canton
    crepe, pongee, chiffon and georgette are appropriate&#8212;but one should
    avoid velvets and fur trimmings. Bright linings are in bad taste, and while
    fur trimmings are not correct one may wear a fur piece or fur coat. Plain
  black seal or lynx are most appropriate, although other furs may be worn.</p>
  <p> It is important to mention, at this point, that there are no iron-clad
    rules concerning mourning. No one is under compulsion to wear mourning
          unless one
        particularly wishes to do so. Indeed, to wear black when one does not
    genuinely mourn is a form of hypocrisy; while one may wear bright colors
    and yet
          be sincerely unhappy. It is entirely a matter of
    taste; but if one prefers to be conventional, black should be worn.</p>
  <h3><a name="materials" id="materials"></a>Materials for Mourning Hats</h3>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illus/20-13-fig13.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,372);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/20-13-fig13-t.jpg" alt="Figure 13" width="117" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>It is safe to say that any material without a shiny, glossy surface may
    be used for mourning. Crepe is the best and most commonly used; dull taffeta
    is excellent, chiffon and georgette are all appropriate. For summer one may
    select dull braid straw, or even one of the blocked straw hats, dull in finish.</p>
  <p>One should remember, in making a mourning hat, that the garment is a symbol
    of grief, and should not be attractive. If the fabric is of good quality,
    the lines of soft, graceful proportions and the trimming quiet and dignified
    in tone, no suggestion of clever style is necessary. For the elderly woman
    a small jet ornament is appropriate, but it is always best to confine one's
    self solely to the material and trim the hat simply with a shirring or ruffling
    of the same material from which the hat itself is made.</p>
  <p>Sometimes a dull ornament on the head of the hat pin provides trimming to
    the mourning hat. Sometimes, in the case of very young girls, a black wreath
    is used. Frequently the material is so draped, in application, that it forms
    a most delightful trimming by itself. Not that the trimming must be delightful,
    of course, but the skillful milliner is always skillful&#8212;even in the
    matter of making mourning hats!</p>
  <p>The mourning veil varies with each succeeding season. Sometimes it is long,
    sometimes very short. Sometimes it is of extremely heavy mesh; sometimes
    the mesh is fine and delicate. Very often the veil has a deep border, but
    recently the tendency has been to omit the border as a sign of ostentation.
    The only type of veil that rarely changes is the widow's veil, which is of
    crepe and falls almost to the knees.</p>
  <h3><a name="period" id="period"></a>The Period of Mourning</h3>
  <p>The length of the mourning period depends upon the tie which existed between
    the deceased and the bereaved. The longest period is two years&#8212;except
    in the case of an elderly woman whose husband has died and who never intends
    to take off black. The first year of mourning, under ordinary circumstances,
    is called &quot;deep mourning,&quot; when one wears solid black. The second
    year is called &quot;second mourning,&quot; during which time gray, lavender,
    purple and black-and-white may be worn. The change from black to colors should
    never be so abrupt as to be startling.</p>
  <p>It is not good form for children to wear black. Upon the death of a parent
    they may wear white relieved by lavender for six months or so. But it is
    not appropriate for young children to wear solid black, to carry black-bordered
    handkerchiefs or to use mourning stationery. Delicate grays, lavenders and
    white are correct for the girl of fifteen or sixteen, if she feels she must
    wear mourning.</p>
  <p>It is customary for the period of mourning to depend upon the strength of
    the bond which held the deceased and the mourner together. For instance,
    a woman will wear mourning for two years for her husband, while it is customary
    to wear mourning for a brother or cousin one year.</p>
  <p>Women everywhere are realizing more the value of the correct hat for every
    occasion. It is so comforting to know just what to wear. It is also a great
    satisfaction to know how to make all types of hats. It is with the aid of
    our trusty friends, needles, pins and thread, combined with the willingness,
    determination and good judgment, that this may be accomplished.</p>

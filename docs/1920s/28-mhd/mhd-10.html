  <h3>    <a name="brim" id="brim"></a>The Brim of the Hat</h3>
  <p>When you know how to make frames for crowns and how to cover crowns, you
    know one-half of the most important part of millinery. Now it remains to
    complete the second half, and to learn how to cover and finish the brim of
    the hat.</p>
  <p>It is the brim that most often determines the style of the hat, and the
    crown that carries out and emphasizes that style idea. You realize, therefore,
    that the brim requires as much care and consideration in its construction
    as the crown. Indeed, there are many ways to drape a brim which not only
    indicate the style note, but enhance and beautify the hat.</p>
  <p>On the plain sailor hat, the plain stretched covering is used. It is simple,
    because the hat it covers, is simple. An elaborately draped and covered brim
    on a plain sailor shape would be inappropriate and unattractive. But, if
    the severe brim is unbecoming, a soft drape may be used for the crown. Thus
    the lines of the hat are softened, and the whole effect made more becoming.
    However, it is always best to avoid the straight brim if it does not harmonize
    with the lines of the face.</p>
  <p>One type of drape very frequently used on brims is called the Lengthwise
    Drape. It may be as full as desired, and may finish the brim with or without
    an extension.</p>
  <h3><a name="lengthwise" id="lengthwise"></a>The Lengthwise Drape</h3>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illus/10-01-fig1.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',451,773);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/10-01-fig1-t.jpg" alt="Figure 1. Lengthwise drape" width="220" height="126" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>If velvet is used when making the lengthwise drape, it should be on the
    bias. But if the material used is extremely sheer, such as georgette crepe,
    net or lace, it should be used on the straight. This crosswise drape is most
    often used on up-turned brims. In this case the upper side of the brim is
    covered with plain material find the lengthwise drape is used as a facing
    on the under side of the brim. To make the lengthwise drape, follow these
    steps.</p>
  <p>1. Cut your material two inches wider than the brim and twice the length
    of the outer edge of the brim.</p>
  <p>2.	Join the pieces together with a plain seam.</p>
  <p>3.	Now divide the drape into eight sections. Make 
    a one-inch underturning 
    on one edge and gather near the raw edge of the material. This
will make a tuck about three-quarters of an inch wide.</p>
  <p>4. Proceed to divide the brim of the hat into eight sections and mark the
    points distinctly. Begin the division of the brim at the center front when
    marking the eight principal points of the brim.</p>
  <p>5. The drape should now be pinned to the edge of the brim, the shirring
    line meeting exactly the edge of the brim. The marks on the brim and the
    marks on the drape should correspond.</p>
  <p>6.	Sew together, using small back stitch.</p>
  <p>7. Draw the fullness into the headsize and baste. Be sure that this fullness
    is so drawn in that the lines are straight and even from the headsize to
    the edge.</p>
  <p>If you use the lengthwise drape without an extension, cut your sections
  allowing exactly the same fullness, but do not allow for the tuck at the edge.</p>
  <h3>  <a name="shirred" id="shirred"></a>The Shirred Drape</h3>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illus/10-02-fig2.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',570,776);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/10-02-fig2-t.jpg" alt="Figure 2. Shirred drape" width="220" height="160" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>There are several variations of the lengthwise drape, but most important
    among them is the shirred drape. It can be made with plain shirrings, one
    inch apart, or with tucks stitched in one inch apart with cords running through
    them on which to draw up the fullness Both 
    are attractive, and the type used depends largely upon material 
    and style.</p>
  <p>If you intend using cords, decide first how many of them you want to use.
    Then cut your drape in the same manner as the lengthwise drape is cut, allowing
    for the tucks. Place one cording exactly at the edge of the brim, and the
    others spaced equally between the edge and the headsize. First pin and then
    sew firmly to the brim, and then match the eight points on drape and brim.
    The fullness must be even and straight. To finish, draw the fullness into
    the headsize and baste in place. Finish the edge with a bias binding.</p>
  <p>The whole beauty of the shirred drape depends upon artistic and attractive
    arrangement of the fullness The shirred drape is very similar to the corded
    drape and is handled in the same manner, but the fullness in the shirred
    drape is drawn up on threads instead of on a cording. For this reason, it
    is more
    difficult to arrange the shirred drape attractively. Practice until you achieve
    a just-right effect.</p>
  <h3><a name="crosswise" id="crosswise"></a>The Crosswise Drape</h3>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illus/10-03-fig3.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',605,789);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/10-03-fig3-t.jpg" alt="Figure 3. Crosswise drape" width="220" height="167" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>To give a hat an attractive, soft finish, the crosswise drape is frequently
    used. It has no definite style, but may be varied in many ways. The crosswise
    drape sometimes serves the purpose of brim covering and trimming in one.
    It is made in this manner:</p>
  <p>1. First cut the drape the length of the outside edge of the brim, and at
    least one-and-a-half times its width. If the material is very fine and soft,
    like georgette, it may be advisable to use as much as three times its width.
    You must use your own judgment in this matter, and make the width of the
    drape correct according to the style of the hat and the material used.</p>
  <p>2. Now pin the drape to the brim, arranging the fullness in graceful lines.
    Sew in place, using stab stitches.</p>
  <p>3. One variation of the crosswise drape is to have several rows of cording
    or shirring at the center front, and the remaining part of the drape tacked
    to the frame loosely, so that it falls in soft folds. Never use a great deal
    of sewing on a drape of this kind as it will be held too stiffly. Just use
    enough stitching to keep the material in place.
    If tucks or cords are used, allowance for them should be made when the material
    is cut for the drape.</p>
  <p> There will be extra fullness at the headsize. This should be laid in plaits
      and sewed neatly in place. The plaits should be evenly placed at intervals
      around the headsize.</p>
  <h3><a name="over" id="over"></a>The Over Drape</h3>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illus/10-04-fig4.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',526,770);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/10-04-fig4-t.jpg" alt="Figure 4. The over drape" width="220" height="141" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>When a drape is so arranged that it begins at the headsize on one side of
    the brim, is brought over the edge of the brim to the headsize on the reverse
    side in one continuous piece, it is called the over drape. You should have
    no trouble in identifying this drape whenever you see it, as its name explains
    it.</p>
  <p>1. Always cut the material for the over drape on the bias. It should be
    as long, as the outside edge of the brim, and twice as wide as the brim.
    If there is to be an extension at the edge of the brim, be sure to allow
    for it when cutting the drape.</p>
  <p>2. An extension, if you are going to have one at the edge of the brim, would
    be simply in the form of a tuck. The stitching would come exactly at the
    edge of the brim.</p>
  <p>3. Sew the extension in place, and then drape the remaining material toward
    the headsize in even, graceful fullness Sew in place.</p>
  <p>4.	Repeat on the under side of the brim.</p>
  <h3><a name="flat" id="flat"></a>Covering a Flat Brim</h3>
  <p>I am sure that you will want to learn to cover a flat or slightly drooping
    brim. Let us suppose we are to use black velvet for the covering. You have
    already made your buckram frame, wired it at the edge and covered the wire
    with bias stretched crinoline as directed in an earlier lesson. Mark the
    center front and back of brim and place your velvet on the top of the brim
    with the warp thread running from front to back.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illus/10-05-fig5.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,601);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/10-05-fig5-t.jpg" alt="Figure 5. Covering a flat brim" width="194" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Now begin to pin at the front edge of the brim, then place a few pins at
    the back and then at each side. Stretch the velvet tightly over the brim
    and pin as shown in Fig. 5. After this has been done the material must be
    cut away from the edge, leave at least three-quarters of an inch. Cut a piece
    from the center of the brim, leaving about one inch to extend around the
    head-size. Slash the headsize the same as the buckram 
    frame, usually about one inch apart.</p>
  <p>Pin around the headsize and sew with the stab stitch, re-pin the edge of
    the brim to remove any fullness Now to sew the velvet to the brim, hold the
    brim very carefully between the fingers and thumb of the left hand and remove
    the pins as you sew. The velvet may be turned to the wrong side of the brim,
    or the underside, and caught down with the catch stitch or the hemming stitch
    may be used.</p>
  <p>The lower part of the brim is covered in the same way, but the outside edge
    must be finished so that it will look very neat. Trim the under facing to
    about one-half inch from the edge of the brim. It may be turned to the inside
    and slip stitched or overhanded to the upper part, or one of the very best
    ways of finishing the edge of a plain covered hat is to sew in a piece of
    frame wire, or cable wire, if you desire. This will give a cord effect when
    finished. Place the wire around the edge of the brim and cover it with the
    velvet. Slip the cut edge of the velvet inside between the covering and sew
    the wire in place by taking a stitch about one-quarter inch long under the
    wire and pass the needle up between the brim and facing. Do not join the
    wire until almost around to that point. A milliner's clasp may be used, or
    it may be carefully overhanded to the edge of the material and then covered
    and finished as mentioned.</p>
  <h3>Brim of Hat Finished with Bias Fold</h3>
  <h3><a name="width" id="width"></a>Determining Width</h3>
  <p>It is a little hard to determine the exact width of a fold to be placed
    on the edge of a brim. Of course, some materials such as chiffon, georgette
    crepe and organdie stretch a great deal. For these materials it is suggested
    that you stretch a few inches of material over the brim, so that you can
    approximate the amount that it will stretch. However, it is considered safe
    to estimate twice the desired width of the fold when finished, plus 1 1/2
    inches for making. The 1 inch is allowed for turnings and the 1/2 inch for
    stretching.</p>
  <h3><a name="placing" id="placing"></a>Placing Fold on Edge of Brim</h3>
  <p>If you are making a velvet fold which is to extend one inch on each side
    of the brim, cut a piece of material 3 1/2 inches wide. Fold this strip of
    material through the center and place it over the edge of the brim. Stick
    a pin through both fold and brim. Stretch the material through the center
    of the fold until all fullness is out of the inner edge. Pin ends together
    at joinings. Allow quarter-inch seams. Remove the bias material from the
    brim and stretch the joining and press or steam open as directed.</p>
  <p>Now you are ready to replace this bias fold and in so doing be sure to place
    the seam at the back or side back. In case there are two seams place them
    at the sides. Begin at the seam or one of the seams and pin in place as directed.
    Care must be taken that the fold isn't too tight or the brim will be drawn
    out of shape, but if the fold is too loose the finish will not be at all
    attractive.</p>
  <p>Now turn about one-half inch of the material over a cord or wire and sew
    it to the brim by means of the slip stitch. This makes a very neat finish
    and is called tooling the edge. This is accomplished by placing the forefinger
    on the wire and pressing down. Take a stitch into the frame, forcing needle
    out under the wire or cord. With the needle tuck the material gently under
    the wire. Take a stitch about one-eighth or one-quarter inch long under the
    wire. Draw thread tight to hold the material under the wire.</p>
  <h3><a name="finish" id="finish"></a>Finish at Edge Without Wire</h3>
  <p>To finish the edge of the brim without a wire proceed to join the pieces
    as previously mentioned. Make a half-inch turning
    on both sides of the fold and pin it in place. The fold is slip stitched
    to the brim. Take a stitch under the fold near the edge; the next stitch
    is taken directly opposite into material on the brim. This is repeated, causing
    the length of the stitch to alternate first into the fold and then into the
    brim.</p>
  <h3><a name="cording" id="cording"></a>Cording</h3>
  <p>Sometimes the edges of a brim are finished by means of cording. For this
    purpose yarn may be used, a candlemaking or regular cord purchased for the
    purpose. For covering the cord follow the directions given below.</p>
  <p>1. Make a bias strip wide enough to cover the cord, allowing enough for
    the seam.</p>
  <p>2.	Fold this strip through the center with the wrong side out.</p>
  <p>3. Stitch far enough from the turned edge to make a casing large enough
    to draw the cord through. Attach the cord to the bodkin, that is, cut away
    a few strands at the end of the cord to bring it to a point, sew this end
    of the cord firmly to a round bodkin, wrapping the cord where it is attached
    to the bodkin. Be very careful not to bunch the cord, and you will find that
    it draws through the material very easily.</p>
  <p>4. Insert the point of the bodkin in the casing made for the cord, allowing
    one-third of its length to extend outside the casing.</p>
  <p>5. Now sew the end of the bias casing firmly to the cord where it is attached
    to the bodkin.</p>
  <p>6. Draw the bodkin through the casing made for the cord. This turns the
covering right side out over the cord. </p>
  <p> Another method is to measure two times the length of the
    bias strip plus a couple inches more. Begin at one end and fold bias material
      over cord having the right side of the material in the inside. Baste and
      sew by hand or machine. Care must be taken that the stitching isn't done
      too near the cord or it will be impossible to pull it through. Secure the
      end of bias strip to the middle of the cord. This may be done by stitching
      down the end. Now begin at the end of casing and gradually pull it over
        the uncovered cord similar to the way the casing of an umbrella is drawn
        off.
  Cut off the uncovered cord.</p>
  <h3><a name="importance" id="importance"></a>Importance of the Eight Points in Brim Draping </h3>
  <p> In hat-making, the eight points of both brim and crown are extremely important.
        The principal points of both crown and brim are the center front, the
    center back, and the points halfway between them. The other four points are
    located
        halfway between the side points. Always mark these eight points carefully
        before proceeding with the covering of a brim or crown.</p>
  <p>Similarly, when crown and brim are joined, these eight points must meet.
    Also, when draping the crown and brim, it is necessary that these points
    be matched on the frame and covering so that the grain of the material will
    run in the right direction.</p>
  <p>In trimming, the eight points of the hat are also very important. This subject
    will be covered exhaustively in a later lesson which teaches the design,
    or art, of millinery. For the present, bear strongly in mind that the eight
    points of the hat are important and must be carefully found and marked when
    the hat is being made.</p>
  <p>Incidentally, when the paper is folded to obtain the first circle pattern,
    the lines where this paper is folded correspond exactly with the eight points
    of the hat.</p>
  <h3><a name="braid" id="braid"></a>Covering Brims with Braid</h3>
  <p>You might be quite clever in the matter of covering a brim with silk or
    cloth, but unless you know how to handle straws and braids as deftly, you
    will not be quite ready to undertake a hat of this type. Quite as much care
    must be taken with the braid brim as with the silk or cloth brim. Indeed,
    unless the braid is correctly applied the hat will not be a success.</p>
  <p>If you are planning to cover your hat with any of the rough or fancy straws,
    with hemp, tagel or similar straws, be sure to select a wire frame. And be
    sure that the frame is first covered with mull, silk or crinoline. If a willow
    shape is available, it is preferable to the wire frame as it is considerably
    lighter and hence easier to work on.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illus/10-06-fig6.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',608,768);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/10-06-fig6-t.jpg" alt="Figure 6. Applying braid" width="220" height="168" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Fig. 6 will help you to understand how the braid is applied to the brim
    of a hat. If the hat has an irregular brim the braid will have to be cut
    instead of covering it with a long piece. It may be necessary to lap the
    braid a little more in some places than in others. However, 
    avoid lapping it too much as it will waste the material and make the hat
    very heavy.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illus/10-07-fig7.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',434,785);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/10-07-fig7-t.jpg" alt="Figure 7. Applying braid to brim" width="220" height="119" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Fig. 7 shows the applying of braid to a wire frame&#8212;the idea being
    to remove the braid after it is stiffened by means of shellac. Of course,
    the braid may be sewed through the wires if you desire, but in this case
    the frame should be covered with crinoline to keep the wire from injuring
    the braid and the wire will form the foundation and the braid will not need
    to be stiffened, and therefore will not be removed from the frame. It is
    just a matter which you must always decide for yourself, whether or not you
    want a stiff brim or one a little more pliable.</p>
  <p>When applying braid or straw to a hat, either to the crown or the brim,
    be sure that it is neither too tight nor too loose, otherwise it will not
    lie flat and smooth. The whole beauty of the work depends upon the success
    with which the straw is manipulated. Begin at one side of the brim, either
    the right or the left, at the center back and sew from right to left. Make
    large stitches on the wrong side and small stitches on the right side. The
    braid should be allowed to project over the outer edge about one-quarter
    of an inch.</p>
  <p>When using narrow braid, cross the second strand over the end of the first
    when you work around to it, so that it is bound down neatly. This second
    row of braid should lap over the first only enough to permit of fastening
    the outer edge of the second to the inner edge of the first row. For this
    reason, the inner edge of the straw should be drawn in so that it lies flat
    against the frame and does not ruffle away from it. Similarly, each row should
    be stretched a little at the outer edge to take out as much fullness as possible
    at the inner edge.</p>
  <p>When the headsize is reached, cut the end of the braid or straw on the bias
    and let it overlap the row before it, to achieve a neat, inconspicuous finish.
    Be sure that you stretch the straw as you approach the headsize so that it
    will fit the sharper curves.</p>
  <h3><a name="horse" id="horse"></a>Covering the Brim with Horse-hair Braid </h3>
  <p> Stiff braids or straws, such as horse-hair, require wire foundations such
        as are used for maline and net hats. The headsize wire is covered with
        maline, the edge wire is similarly covered, and then the whole brim is
        covered with maline also.</p>
  <p>Horse-hair braid is sometimes as much as two inches wide. Very fine silk
    thread should be used in applying it and the stitches should not be more
    than one-quarter of an inch long. The back-stitch should be used, and the
    needle should catch only one hair of the braid on the right side.</p>
  <p>In applying the horse-hair braid to the brim, extend the first row over
    the edge wire almost the full width of the braid. You will find that this
    gives a soft, attractive edge. The second row of braid should overlap the
    first just a trifle. To make the ensuing rows of braid lie flat on the brim,
    the coarse thread woven through the inner edge of the braid may be drawn
    up as much as necessary. Horse-hair braid must be cut off neatly and turned
    under at each row.</p>
  <p>Sports hats and dressy hats when made of narrow ribbon are covered exactly
    as braid hats are covered. The ribbon is treated as though it were a braid.
    The whole secret of success with ribbon hats is neat workmanship and a regard
    for a well-finished 
    appearance.</p>
  <h3><a name="tricorne" id="tricorne"></a>The Tricorne</h3>
  <p>There are, of course, various types of brims&#8212;all of which you will
    no doubt encounter in your experience as an expert milliner. Most of them
    you will be able to handle expertly once you master the method of covering
    one frame correctly. But there are some unusual types of frames, with which
    you may have difficulty&#8212;most familiar among them being the tricorne.
    It is an exceptionally good frame for the tailored hat, or the hat intended
    for street wear. It may be made of velvet, satin or straw.</p>
  <p>When applying braid to the brim of the tricorne, always begin at the upper
    edge. The braid should extend about one-quarter of an inch from this edge.
    Do not cover each part of the brim separately, but go around the brim as
    though it were in one part. When you come to corners that are difficult to
    turn, and you find that the braid ruffles a bit, draw the string in the top
    of the braid until the braid lies flat against the frame. See that each row
    overlaps the one before it about an eighth of an inch, and finish underneath
    the brim about a half inch inside the point where the facing will begin&#8212;or
    where the lining will be applied.</p>
  <p>Hats that boast slashed brims are not any more difficult to cover than ordinary
    brims. Just cover each part separately and
    when you approach the headsize, where the brim becomes one again, go around
    the hat.</p>
  <p>Never forget that careful workmanship is the final test of success in millinery&#8212;as
    in everything else.</p>
  <h3><a name="linings" id="linings"></a>Linings</h3>
  <p>Most beginners in millinery have the mistaken idea that the lining is unimportant&#8212;that
    any material may be used for the lining and it may be applied in any way.
    Just as a slovenly, untidy lining in a dress or cape indicates that a dressmaker
    is a careless, amateurish worker, so does the incorrect lining in a hat indicate
    poor workmanship. A building cannot stand on a poor foundation; a well-made,
    attractive hat cannot appear to its best advantage if the lining does not
    fit properly or is incorrectly applied.</p>
  <p>Although many milliners contend that the lining should be put in the hat
    before the trimming is applied, varied experiences prove that the best time
    to put it in is after the entire hat is completed. If the work is done carefully,
    it will not disturb the flowers or bows.</p>
  <p>In an earlier lesson the various materials for linings were given. If you
    have forgotten, refer to this lesson and study the different materials until
    you are positive that you will not have to refer to the lesson again. Always
    remember that the fabric used for the lining depends upon the style and material
    of the hat. For transparent hats, the same material is used for the lining
    or something just as thin. The most conventional lining is that of light,
    soft silk, although mercerized cotton fabrics are often used for heavier
    hats.</p>
  <h3><a name="making" id="making"></a>Making the Lining</h3>
  <p>Lining that is cut lengthwise will not ravel easily. However it may be cut
    on the bias, or crosswise, if so desired. There are several different methods
    of cutting and applying linings and we will give all the best methods in
    this lesson. The method used depends entirely upon yourself&#8212;the one
    you find most convenient and practical being the logical choice.</p>
  <h3><a name="french" id="french"></a>French Lining</h3>
  <p>One type of lining is called the French lining. It is not used very extensively
    but is useful when the headsize is too large and must be reduced. Follow
    these step-by-step directions and you will find that making the French lining
    is quite a simple matter:</p>
  <p>1. Cut a brace wire in such manner that it will lap one inch and fit exactly
    within the headsize. Lap this wire and tie with tie wire.</p>
  <p>2. Proceed to measure the crown from front to back and from side to side,
    using a tape line flat against the inside of the crown. Take this measurement
    to correspond with the brace wires which form the crown. Pass from the headsize
    across the top of the crown, to the headsize at the other side. Add an inch
    to this measurement. Measure from front to back in the same way adding one
    inch to these measures.</p>
  <p>3. Now cut an oval of silk. Use the two measurements you have just taken
    for the cross and lengthwise diameters.</p>
  <p>4. Turn the edge of the silk over the wire you have prepared and gather
    on this wire with a fine running stitch. This brings the gathers at the headsize
    when the lining is sewed in the hat.</p>
  <p>5.	The lining should now be slip-stitched to the headsize of the hat.</p>
  <h3><a name="plain" id="plain"></a>The Plain Lining</h3>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illus/10-08-fig8.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,650);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/10-08-fig8-t.jpg" alt="Figure 8. The plain lining" width="210" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>The lining which is most commonly used in millinery is just as simple as
    the one you have just made. Be sure, though, in making and applying linings
    that they are high enough in the hat so that they do not show when the hat
    is worn. The plain lining used in millinery is made in this manner:</p>
  <p>1.	Cut a square of the silk, or whatever material 
    you are using for the lining, large enough to cover the greater part of the
      top of the crown. (Usually four inches square.)</p>
  <p>2. Baste this to crinoline and proceed to baste the covered crinoline to
    the inside of the crown. Take a long stitch on the inside and a short one
    on the top of the crown. This is called the tip of the lining (crown tip)
    and it is on this that the name of the milliner is sewed. The center of the
    square should be at the center of the crown.</p>
  <p>3. Cut a bias strip of material, the length of the headsize plus one inch
    for seams. Make it as wide as the crown is high plus 2 1/2 inches.</p>
  <p>4. Join the ends of this bias strip, employing a seam on the wrong side.
    This seam should be at the back of the hat when the strip is applied.</p>
  <p>5. Now make a half-inch underturning on one side of the lining and stitch
    about one-quarter inch from the edge. This makes a neat casing for a ribbon.</p>
  <p>6. If the lining is to be slip-stitched to the hat, make an under- turning
    at the lower edge and baste.</p>
  <p>7. With the seam at the center back, place the wrong side of the lining
    against the inside of the crown. Pin the lining in place and slip-stitch
    to the hat. Or, you may omit this last underturning and simply pin the lining
    in place with the right side of the lining against the headsize, the large
    part of the lining extending outward. Sew in place using the buttonhole stitch.
    Turn the lining up into position. Do not use the overcast stitch when applying
    linings as this stitch is liable to show when the lining is turned up inside
    the crown.</p>
  <p>8. To finish this lining, run a ribbon through the casing at the top. Draw
    as much as necessary, to fit the head snugly and comfortably, and tie in
    a neat bow. Sometimes milliners finish their hat linings with tiny hand-made
    flowers. This lining is suitable for use in summer hats of straw braid.</p>
  <h3><a name="tailored" id="tailored"></a>The Tailored Lining </h3>
  <p class="clear"> <em><a href="illus/10-09-fig9.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,611);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/10-09-fig9-t.jpg" alt="Figure 9. Tailored lining" width="197" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>The lining is the final test of workmanship. The professional milliner
    pays as much attention to the lining as she does to the drape of the material,
        the angle at which the trimming is applied. Some milliners prefer the
    tailored
        lining because it is so neat, so excellent a piece of good workmanship
        when well-made. The tailored lining may be of black silk or black mercerized
        cotton, but harmonizing and matching colors are also used to a great
    extent.</p>
  <p>The tailored lining is used more extensively than others at the present
    time. Sometimes it is made of two contrasting colors of silk, the crown tip
    being of one of the colors used on the hat and the rest of the lining being
    the same color as the hat. But most often one color is used.</p>
  <p>1. First cut a circle of silk for the lining crown tip. It may be large
    or small, as preferred.</p>
  <p>2. Cut a bias strip of silk long enough to reach from the head- size to
    the circle, adding one inch for seam allowances.</p>
  <p>3.	Join the ends with a plain seam.</p>
  <p>4. Now make an underturning at the top of the lining and stitch to form
    a casing for a cord.</p>
  <p>5. Proceed to draw in the cord and draw the lining into fullness until it
    just fits the outer edge of the circle.</p>
  <p>6. Pin in place and sew along the stitching of the cord, using a fine back
    stitch.</p>
  <p>7. Make a half-inch underturning at the lower edge and pin into place in
    the hat, being sure that the seam is at the center back of the crown.</p>
  <p>8.	Slip-stitch neatly and carefully to the headsize.</p>
  <p>You will find that this makes an attractive lining, and gives the inside
    of the hat a smart, well-finished appearance. Always experiment with the
    fullness of the lining until you find exactly that point where the hat fits
    the head snugly and comfortably. Then proceed with the finishing stitches.</p>
  <p>But perhaps you find that your hat is too large, or too small, and that
    not even the fullness or scantiness of the lining can alter the fit of the
    hat sufficiently. In this case it becomes necessary to use a bandeau.</p>
  <h3><a name="bandeaux" id="bandeaux"></a>The Use of Bandeaux in Millinery</h3>
  <p>The bandeau is simply a band or fillet around the headsize of a hat to reduce
    or increase its size. The word has its origin from the French word which
    means &quot;little band&quot; and originally meant the band around a man's
    cap.</p>
  <p>Bandeaux are made on buckram foundations. Anything less firm and stiff than
    buckram is unsatisfactory. The buckram is wired all around to give it strength
    and resistance. When used to reduce the headsize, it is merely a round piece
    which is called a halo. It is made just as wide as is necessary.</p>
  <p>Usually the sides of the halo bandeau are slanting so that the hat will
    fit more firmly. The sloping effect can be accomplished by cutting the buckram
    from its outer circle almost through to the inner one and overlapping to
    obtain the required slant. Or a paper pattern may first be used to obtain
    the right slant, and then the paper halo used as a pattern for the one made
    of buckram.</p>
  <p>The buckram halo bandeau is used only when the hat is very large&#8212;so
    large that the head reaches clear through to the crown top of the hat. If
    the headsize is only slightly too large, soft bandeaux may very successfully
    be used. This is made of a very narrow strip of lining that just fits the
    headsize. One edge is finished with a narrow hem through which a ribbon is
    run, the other edge is sewed to the headsize of the hat. This lining is then
    drawn up on the ribbon until the hat stays in the proper position.</p>
  <p>To increase the size of a hat, or to tilt it at an angle no; obtainable
    in any other way, buckram is also used. And as before, the edges are wired.
    In this case, the bandeau is put on either side, or at the front or back.
    This raises the hat from the head, and if the bandeau is correctly fitted
    to the headsize, the hat will feel comfortable. A trimming of flowers or
    ribbon usually conceals the bandeau.</p>
  <p>You must practice and experiment with too-small and too-large frames until
    you are able to apply bandeaux correctly. The mere reading of this lesson
    cannot help unless you actually do the work. Look at hats in which bandeaux
    have been used, see how it is done, and then practice on your own frames.</p>
  <p>Do not leave this lesson until you have so thoroughly mastered linings that
    you will be able to apply one in any hat quickly and without the least hesitancy.
    If you do not do it now, you will have to refer to this lesson later, when
    you are making pretty hats for yourself and for others.</p>

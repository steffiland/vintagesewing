  <h3>    <a name="secrets" id="secrets"></a>Hat-Box Secrets</h3>
  <p>No matter how clear and exhaustive lessons are made, no matter how much
    time and thought is devoted to their preparation, little questions are bound
    to arise that are not covered in the particular subjects treated throughout
    the course. We feel that these lessons are not complete until we have covered
    every possible phase of millinery so completely, so exhaustively, that no
    problem can possibly confront the student.</p>
  <p>For this reason we have combed closely every book on millinery ever written;
    we have culled the best ideas from many years of experiences&#8212;and have
    gathered into this lesson of HAT-BOX SECRETS the little important bits of
    information that do not warrant a lesson by themselves, that have no definite
    part in the lessons already covered&#8212;and yet that are of too great importance
    to be omitted.</p>
  <p>These HAT-BOX SECRETS contain valuable information&#8212;much of it being
    information that cannot be found elsewhere. We add it to a course that is
    already one of the most complete and authoritative of its kind, and we know
    that the student will see its value instantly. The subjects are entirely
    unrelated. Each paragraph is a little lesson in itself. No attempt has been
    made to arrange the information with any regard for sequence or chronology.
    You must simply read this lesson as you would read a story, noting well what
    is said, checking the parts you particularly want to remember, reading and
    studying clear through to the end and remembering carefully what you have
    read.</p>
  <p>But unlike the story, you must return to this lesson frequently, When there
    is some important bit of information you are seeking, but that does not seem
    to have a particular place in the course&#8212;look for it in HAT-BOX
    SECRETS. If there is some new idea you have been thinking of&#8212;some original
    and &quot;different&quot; design for which you have been striving and for
    which just the proper spark of inspiration is lacking&#8212;glance through
    your HAT-BOX SECRETS. You may find just the inspiration you are seeking&#8212; just
    the random idea that will crystallize your own idea.</p>
  <p>And so we offer you HAT-BOX SECRETS as a sort of &quot;finishing touch&quot; to
    your course&#8212;a more or less &quot;mixed lesson&quot; on important subjects
    relating to millinery. We know you will find it both interesting and valuable
    and we want you to give it as much careful attention, and to study it as
    wholeheartedly, as the other lessons of the course.</p>
  <h3><a name="veil" id="veil"></a>The Story of the Veil</h3>
  <p>Few people suspect the large part veils play in the charm of hats. Millinery
    has a great deal for which to be grateful to veils, for many a plain unattractive
    hat is made charming by the simple addition of a smart veil. Of course they
    are not always in style, but we want you to know about them just the same.</p>
  <p>There are many kinds of veils, of course&#8212;street veils and bridal veils
    and mourning veils&#8212;each veil serving its own particular purpose in
    its own particular way. Bridal veils and mourning veils have already been
    discussed; but let us see exactly how veils should be arranged for street
    wear.</p>
  <p>The veil is symbolic of an ancient custom when women never appeared on the
    street unless their features were carefully hidden from observation. Although
    the tradition is a very beautiful one, we of the twentieth century must admit
    that it is not very practical. The veil worn today is meant as a decoration,
    an ornament&#8212;it should not conceal the features unless it is a mourning
    veil.</p>
  <p>The draping of the veil depends largely upon the kind selected, the shape
    of the hat, and the face which is to be attractively framed. Every woman
    must be somewhat the designer of her own veil-drape, but there are some general
    rules that can be followed.</p>
  <p>If an oblong veil is used, the best way to arrange it is to catch up one
    end close to the crown, and allow the other end to fall gracefully in cascade
    effect at the side. Of course, this is not becoming to all types of shapes,
    but with the rolling brim sailor and other brimmed hats it is usually most
    attractive.</p>
  <p>With straight sailor shapes, picture hats and other hats of this type, veils
    may be arranged to fall over the brim and shade the eyes. But the brim should
    always be wide enough to hold the veil out from the face&#8212;if the brim
    is very narrow the veil will be too near the face and cast an unbecoming
    dark shadow over it.</p>
  <p>Very often veils are worn for comfort only. On the automobile trip, for
    instance, or on a very windy day, a well-adjusted veil keeps the dust out
    of the eyes. Tight-fitting veils can be adjusted in two ways. The veil can
    be applied first, pinned to the hair, and the hat placed on over it; or the
    veil can be applied
    to the edge of the hat, drawn under the chin, tied at the back and a tiny
    hairpin adjusted to keep the loose ends in place. The latter plan is the
    best as it keeps the hat from blowing off, but the former plan has its advantages,
    too, as it keeps the hair from blowing about.</p>
  <p>The veil gives a certain charm and grace to the appearance. One should study
    one's hat, one's veil and one's features, arranging the veil to its best
    advantage. After a little experience one becomes deft and clever in the arranging
    of veils of all kinds&#8212;and it is knowledge worth while having.</p>
  <p>Ready-made veils are finished in patterns. A fancy-patterned veil should
    be used with a plain hat; a plain mesh veil with a fancy hat. Veils with
    novelty scroll designs should be allowed to fall gracefully in folds, but
    plain mesh veils should be drawn up under the chin and fastened at the back.
    In patterned veils it is important to note where the pattern comes. Perhaps
    the adjusting of the veil a least bit to the right or left, or dropping it
    an inch or two will give a much more becoming and pleasing effect.</p>
  <h3><a name="pins" id="pins"></a>The Position of Pins</h3>
  <p>A trifling detail&#8212;yet it may save you a great deal of time and trouble.
    When cutting out patterns and pinning the brim and tissue-paper pattern together,
    always be sure that the pins face outward. As soon as you attempt to cut
    a pattern using a frame of buckram or wire as a base you will understand
    why this precaution is necessary.</p>
  <p>You see, as you cut around the edge of the frame you will find that the
    points of the pins project beyond the edge of the brim. If these were the
    heads of the pins, you would not be able to cut a smooth, clear edge as the
    head would be in the way. You would have to withdraw each pin, cut the paper
    and replace the pin again. But with the points projecting and the heads inside,
    you can simply draw in each pin a little, cut past the point, and extend
    the point once again. It saves time, trouble and the possibility
    of error.</p>
  <h3><a name="curved" id="curved"></a>Covering Curved Surfaces</h3>
  <p>Curved surfaces usually require a different method of covering than the
    plain, straight surfaces. The rolled sailor, for instance, requires very
    careful workmanship as it is turned up next to the face and any little blunders
    will be immediately evident. It will be found easier to cover the curved
    brim, and other curved surfaces with material cut on the bias instead of
    straight material.</p>
  <p>Bias, as you know, stretches and gives. A material cut on the bias will
    stretch to the curve it is expected to take&#8212;whereas materials cut straight
    will not. It would be very difficult indeed to cover a rolled sailor with
    material cut entirely straight, but with bias material the work is quite
    simple.</p>
  <p>Whenever you have a curved surface, then remember the bias. And remember
    it also when there is an edge that needs finishing. The bias flange, which
    is simply a piece of bias material stretched, can be used as a finishing
    or trimming very nicely. A bias flange applied to the edge of the brim of
    a hat gives it a professional touch that adds greatly to its appearance.</p>
  <h3><a name="novelty" id="novelty"></a>Novelty Trimmings</h3>
  <p>Some charming effects can be achieved in millinery through the use of novelty
    trimmings. Every season sees its new novelty&#8212;sometimes a jet ornament,
    sometimes beads in novel design, sometimes wool and floss flowers, sometimes
    ornaments of metal in lacquered or brilliant Oriental effects. But many so-called &quot;novelties&quot; return
    year after year, disappearing occasionally but always coming back in some
    form or other. These novelties can be easily made at home, and the savings
    are really worth-while as the ready-made prices are generally high on novelties.</p>
  <p>Silk fruit is a novelty of enduring popularity. No matter how much in demand
    other types of trimmings are, there always seems to be a place for the charming
    and novel silk fruits that anyone can make at home.</p>
  <p>There are silk apples, for instance. They are made of scraps of silk, and
    if the colors harmonize, the whole brim can be covered with these delightful
    little novelties. However silk alone need not be used&#8212;fruits may be
    made of satin and velvet too, but fruit of only one kind of material should
    be used on the same hat.</p>
  <p>The inside of silk or satin-covered fruit consists of wadding. To make the
    apples, proceed in this manner:</p>
  <p>1. First cut five circles of sheet wadding, making each about 2 1/2 to 3
    inches in diameter.</p>
  <p>2. Roll these bits of wadding together in the palm of the hand to form small
    balls, and wind a few threads around them to keep the shape.</p>
  <p>3. Now take the material you want to use for the fruit. Cut a circle of
    the silk or satin 2 inches in diameter, and turn the raw edges in all around.</p>
  <p>4.	Shir around the outer edge of the circle to make a circular covering.</p>
  <p>5. You are now ready to sew a piece of lace wire, about 4 inches long, to
    the ball of wadding at the bottom. Slip the covering of silk over the ball
    of wadding, draw up the shirring thread and sew it securely.</p>
  <p>6. Now push up the needle directly through the center of the apple and let
    it extend through the top. Draw through the thread, turn the needle and push
    down through the apple again, making a small stitch.</p>
  <p>7. Proceed to make several such stitches right in the center so that a dent
    is made to indicate where the stem should be. This finishes the apple.</p>
  <p>Fruit of this kind can be used individually, or combined with foliage and
    field grasses and used in clusters. Sometimes no stems are used, and the
    back of the apple is sewed flat against the hat. When the whole brim is covered
    in this way a most charming effect is secured. Sometimes a tiny square of
    black velvet is stitched to the center of the apple to indicate the stem.
    With a little originality many striking effects can be secured.</p>
  <p>Velvet cherries is another novelty used by fashionable milliners everywhere,
    and almost all the time. They, too, are quite easy to make. Crocheted flowers
    of chenille are popular, and braided ribbon is always in good taste&#8212;and
    good style. As long as a novelty is not too extreme, it may be used without
    any fear of poor taste or wrong style.</p>
  <p>Many interesting novelty trimmings can be made of wool and yarn. Yarn flowers
    garnish many of the sport hats&#8212;no matter what the season&#8212;and
    fruits made of yarn are always attractive. Leather is also being used for
    novelty trimmings, for flowers, leaves and designs in applique and for fruits
    and flowers used individually or arranged in clusters.</p>
  <p>For your convenience, we are listing here some of the flower, feather and
    sundry other trimmings that can be purchased ready-made and that really do
    not warrant the time it takes to make them at home. These novelty trimmings
    cost very little when you purchase them, but of course, if you wish you can
    make them yourself. Your lesson on flower-making will help you with suggestions
    and the information at the end of this lesson will tell you about some interesting
    flowers you have not yet learned about. </p>
  <p class="clear">FORGET-ME-NOTS. <em><a href="illus/23-02-fig2.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,427);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/23-02-fig2-t.jpg" alt="Figure 2. Poppies" width="136" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Small<em><a href="illus/23-01-fig1.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,439);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/23-01-fig1-t.jpg" alt="Figure 1. Forget-me-nots" width="140" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em> flowers
    arranged in clusters. Ideal for children's hats. Appropriate only for summery
    hats of straw, leghorn or light-colored
    silks. This type of flower is not used for encircling the outer edges of
    hats, or the brims of close-fitting hats. They are used ordinarily for application
    to the side-crown of the hat&#8212;which is usually a drooping-brim sailor
    hat&#8212;and to encircle the crown. Sometimes a cluster of the forget-me-nots
    is used on the brim.</p>
  <p>POPPIES. This flower, most commonly used in its natural color of bright
    red, is very often used for making the whole hat. The petals are spread apart
    and sewed down to the foundation, overlapping one another. The entire frame
    is covered, and then poppies are clustered together and used as a finishing
    touch. This makes a most unusual hat, and one that can be worn only by people
    of fair complexions and good features. The poppy, which is made usually of
    fine, sheer silk, makes an excellent trimming for all-black hats of lace,
    net and ma-line. Spring and fall are the best seasons of the year for poppy
    wearing, as the bright red flowers appear entirely too warm for mid-summer. </p>
  <p class="clear">CRUSHED ROSES. <em><a href="illus/23-04-fig4.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,440);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/23-04-fig4-t.jpg" alt="Figure 4.

Crushed roses" width="139" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em> roses
    make excellent novelty trimmings. They may be separated and sewed flat to
    cover the crowns of hats, or they may be used
    to cover the foundations of small hats or toques for all-flower hats. They
    are used also as underbrim trimmings, and they may be of a color to match
    the costume&#8212;green, blue, gray, tan, or the natural color of the rose.
    Crushed roses are sometimes torn apart and the petals used to cover the entire
    crown. Many novel trimming effects can be achieved through the use of this
    flower.</p>
  <p>LILACS. Somehow, lilacs are always popular. They never seem to lose their
    charm. They can be purchased very reasonably and make splendid trimmings
    both for summer and winter hats. The lilacs intended for winter wear are
    of velvet; those meant for summer wear are of muslin. The woman with white
    hair will find lilacs in white, lavender or prune color most becoming. Lilac
    in the natural shade is a mourning flower and may be used to trim the hat
    of the woman who is just coming out of mourning. Lilac and black velvet combine
    beautifully, especially on leghorn and other light straw hats.</p>
  <p class="clear">BUTTERCUPS. <em><a href="illus/23-06-fig6.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,439);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/23-06-fig6-t.jpg" alt="Figure 6. Violets" width="140" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Buttercups<em><a href="illus/23-05-fig5.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,440);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/23-05-fig5-t.jpg" alt="Figure 5. Buttercups" width="140" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em> are sometimes used alone but more often mixed with
    other flowers and foliage. The yellow buttercups are suitable for trimming
    on a child's summer hat. These flowers are often found in wreaths combined
    with other spring flowers. Black and yellow buttercups combined make an appropriate
    trimming on an early spring hat for a young miss. These flowers are made
    of linen or satin and are finished with a high luster.</p>
  <p>VIOLETS. These flowers never lose their popularity and for the early spring
    hat are most attractive. Used on a black hat, they add just the right note
    of color for the elderly woman. For the garden hat, pink rose buds and violets
    form an excellent combination when used on a large hat. These flowers are
    made of linen, satin or velvet. The linen ones being most commonly used.</p>
  <p class="clear">WHEAT. Wheat is<em><a href="illus/23-07-fig7.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,440);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/23-07-fig7-t.jpg" alt="Figure 7. Wheat" width="140" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em> a novelty trimming for the older woman. It is made of silk
    muslin, with goat bristles, usually, for what is known as the &quot;beard&quot; of
    the wheat. It may be black, or the natural wheat color. Black wheat may be
    used on winter hats, but for summer, natural color wheat should be used in
    combination with buttercups, cornflowers, field daisies or other wild flowers.</p>
  <p class="clear"> FOLIAGE. <em><a href="illus/23-08-fig8.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,443);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/23-08-fig8-t.jpg" alt="Figure 8. Foliage" width="141" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>There<em><a href="illus/23-09-fig9.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,430);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/23-09-fig9-t.jpg" alt="Figure 9. Foliage" width="137" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em> are various kinds of foliage used in millinery, many of
    them making attractive novelty trimmings. Mignonette, while it is really
    a flower,
      is used in the nature of foliage to enhance other flowers. Mignonette,
    a small, petalled flower, is usually separated and each spray sewed to the
      upturned hat or turban brim, along the edge. Frequently, the whole hat
    is
      covered with the mignonette and another flower used for trimming purposes.
      Natural grass and heather arranged in small bunches, can be purchased in
      any millinery supply shop. This grass, when intermingled with flowers and
      foliage, makes an excellent finishing touch. As for foliage itself, it
    usually accompanies the flower when purchased, and it may be used according
    to the
      dictates of taste. The leaves of roses or other flowers may be cut from
    the stems and sewed to the frame to be used as a foundation for the hat.
    The
      flowers can then be used for trimming. Lacquered foliage is ordinary foliage
      covered with Japanese lacquer. It may be lacquered any color desired, and
      it makes a most effective trimming when used alone. However, it may be
    combined with the flowers if they too, are lacquered. Heather may be used
    alone or
      with other flowers.</p>
  <p class="clear">GLASS AND TINSEL FRUITS. This<em><a href="illus/23-10-fig10.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,433);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/23-10-fig10-t.jpg" alt="Figure 10. Glass fruit" width="138" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em> is a novelty that is always popular, always
    in good style and good taste. Red glass cherries, berries and miniature apples
    of glass, frosted glass grapes&#8212;all are pretty and make splendid trimmings.
    Some are used for winter hats, others for summer hats; all come with their
    silk or muslin foliage ready to apply to the hat. Your favorite millinery
    supply shop will be able to show you an interesting selection of glass fruits.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illus/23-11-fig11.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,434);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/23-11-fig11-t.jpg" alt="Figure 11. Pins" width="138" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>PINS AND PLAQUES. Each season has its own novelty in pins and plaques. Some
    are simple, some are elaborate. Very often, a pin placed at the right angle
    will provide the correct touch of trimming, and nothing else will be necessary.
    Plaques are often quite attractive and can be used on hats for young and
    old alike. Always be sure, in selecting a novelty of this type that it is
    appropriate, that it is becoming, and that its quality is quite as good as
    the quality of workmanship you are putting into your hat. Both pins and plaques
    are made in the season's most popular colors, as well as black.</p>
  <h3><a name="positions" id="positions"></a>Millinery Positions</h3>
  <p>In these HAT-BOX SECRETS of ours, we want to be sure to tell you about the
    millinery positions that offer opportunities to the girl or woman trained
    in efficient millinery methods. There are several excellent, high-paying
    positions that you, as an expert milliner, will be able to accept if you
    find that you want to do so. Of course, you must have the proper training,
    practice and experience before you can command a high salary.</p>
  <p>Every fashionable millinery establishment has competent preparers, trimmers,
    designers, copyists, salespeople and apprentices. The apprentices do not
    interest you, of course, for you have passed the apprenticeship class. You
    served your apprenticeship during the lessons of this course when you learned
    the construction and design of hats. The apprentice in a millinery establishment
    is really a rather glorified errand girl who brings the materials to the
    other milliners as they need them, delivers hats, runs errands, and makes
    herself generally useful at the same time that she learns all she can about
    hat-making. Naturally, her salary is very small.</p>
  <p>The apprentice soon graduates into the preparer who prepares the hat for
    the trimmer. She covers the frame, drapes the materials, prepares everything
    except the last final touches of trimming. For this work, if she is deft
    and clever she will receive a substantial income.</p>
  <p>The trimmer is an expert in the matter of all trimming innovations. She
    knows exactly how to trim a hat&#8212;and where the trimming should be applied.
    She knows what trimming to use and how to use it. She finishes the hat after
    it passes out of the hands of the preparer. Her salary is usually the same
    as the salary of the preparer, but if she is extremely clever with her trimmings,
    it may be more.</p>
  <p>The designer is the highest paid employee of the millinery establishment.
    It is her duty to originate new styles, to create fashionable bits of headgear
    that the public will greet with pleasure. She must travel to the fashion
    centers and see what famous designers are creating. She must study art. She
    must be constantly on the alert for new ideas and style suggestions. She
    must be able to forecast style so that the hats created by her establishment
    will be the hats everyone wants. The clever designer is always in demand.</p>
  <p>Then there is the copyist who must be able to make a hat from beginning
    to end. She must be able to copy a hat exactly, from a picture or from a
    sample. She must be able to duplicate it in every detail. Expensive French
    importations are copied by copyists and sold to the retail trade at very
    much lower prices. This is a profitable branch of millinery, indeed, and
    quite interesting.</p>
  <p>Some women specialize in certain branches of millinery. Specialization is
    always a sure road to success. If you are very clever in frame making, you
    can make that your specialty. If you are able to design and make frames that
    are original, clever and attractive, you can earn a substantial income by
    devoting your time to just this one thing. Specialists who are able to do
    their one specialty well, always draw larger salaries than those who are
    able to do several things in an average way. The idea is to be able to do
    some one thing better than anyone else.</p>
  <p>Suppose you had to take a millinery position tomorrow&#8212;or next week.
    Which position would you choose? Would you want to be a preparer, a designer,
    a copyist? Which do you think you could do best? When you have decided, see
    that you review all the lessons dealing with that particular phase of millinery
    and make yourself as nearly perfect as possible.</p>
  <h3><a name="test" id="test"></a>The Final Test</h3>
  <p>Now we are going to have a general review to find out whether or not you
    have entirely mastered the technique and design of millinery. Incidentally,
    the lesson will carry with it valuable trimming suggestions which will help
    you with the pretty hats you are going to make.</p>
  <p>In this lesson you will find two pages of illustrations. You will be able
    to pick out some of the different types of hats, the sailor, the poke and
    others. Of course, there are many variations, but they are all in some way
    related to the basic types.</p>
  <p class="clear">Each<em><a href="illus/23-13.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,436);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/23-13-t.jpg" alt="Women wearing hats" width="139" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em> hat<em><a href="illus/23-12.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,449);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/23-12-t.jpg" alt="Women wearing hats" width="143" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em> is trimmed in an appropriate way, with care for a particular purpose.
    For instance, the poke shape is trimmed exactly as we think a poke shape,
    should be trimmed, when it is worn by the type of face shown. The sailor
    boasts a trimming, which we feel most appropriate both to the hat and the
    wearer. However, just as Nature varies the color schemes and petal shapes
    of her flowers, so can you vary the trimmings on the different types of hats.
    Study each hat, and plan a scheme of trimming, different from that pictured.
    Here is a chance to test your knowledge of design, your good taste and your
    originality. They offer you a wealth of trimming suggestions. Pick out the
    hat you are going to make, study the lines, the trimmings. Decide what colors
    would be best, most appropriate, most becoming. Do not attempt to plan a
    different trimming until you have spent considerable time studying the hats
    and referring to the lessons, if you find that necessary. Concentration and
    practice are equally important in determining your success as a milliner,
    and we cannot overestimate the importance of reviewing and re-practicing
    the lessons.</p>

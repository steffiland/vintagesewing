  <h3>    <a name="basic" id="basic"></a>The Eight Basic Types of Millinery Shapes </h3>
  <p> As a beginner of the fascinating art of millinery it is important that
    you know the different hat shapes. In this lesson I am going to tell you
    something
        about the various shapes and show you pictures of them. Of course you
    know that hats may be made in many different shapes, but every one can be
    traced
        back to these eight basic types. The frames may be made of wire, or buckram,
        or may be of braid molded over one of these kinds of frames. The shapes
        remain very much the same whether they are of silk, ribbon, straw or
    felt. For the present it is enough to learn to recognize these shapes. Later
        you will learn all about their particular requirements, about which styles
    are most becoming to various types of faces, etc.</p>
  <h3><a name="bowl" id="bowl"></a>Bowl Shaped Turban</h3>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illus/04-01-fig1.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',539,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/04-01-fig1-t.jpg" alt="Figure 1. Basic hat shapes" width="308" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Let us first study the bowl shaped turban, Fig. 1. This is a type of hat
    that is always fashionable, always being used as a base for other styles&#8212;most
    always becoming to every type of face. In millinery shops and department
    stores it is called &quot;old reliable.&quot;</p>
  <p>The bowl shaped turban is (see I) on the page of hat shapes. Notice the
    bowl shape of the brim&#8212;whence comes the name. The little ridges have
    been added merely to show how the plain bowl shape can be changed to appear
    like something entirely new. But remove these ridges&#8212;and you have the
    true bowl shaped turban.</p>
  <h3><a name="flare" id="flare"></a>The Flare Hat</h3>
  <p>The hat with a flare is in season and out. It is really very pretty when
    correctly made, and there are so many variations. It is not necessary to
    make the hat with the flare effect all the way around, but instead make a
    large flare on the side, or in fact, any place you desire. A double flare
    may be made, for this is also effective. The hat as pictured may be worn
    slightly tipped to one side or may be worn straight on the head with the
    flares shading the features. It is a graceful hat, and one that can be effectively
    trimmed in many novel and interesting ways. (See Fig. B.)</p>
  <h3><a name="rolled" id="rolled"></a>The Rolled Turban</h3>
  <p>Though it maintains meek indifference in the center of the page, the Rolled
    Turban (see E) is really one of the most popular shapes known to millinery.
    Countless adaptations are made from it&#8212;and each season sees it in some
    different form. The rolled turban shown here is the true type, rolling slightly
    higher at the center back. A great many rolled turbans have a brim that is
    even all around instead of being higher on one side.</p>
  <p> Whether the rolled turban is covered with black velvet or gay chiffon depends
    upon whether the hat is intended for an elderly woman or a young girl&#8212;but
    most every type of material is suitable for covering this type of hat.</p>
  <h3><a name="mushroom" id="mushroom"></a> The Mushroom Shape</h3>
  <p> Who doesn't know the mushroom shape with its softly falling brim and its
    snug little crown? Becoming alike to young and old, it has long been one
    of the most popular and practical millinery shapes.</p>
  <p> The mushroom brim droops (see C) as you will note, but the extent of the
    droop varies. It may be slight or deep according to what is more becoming.
    There are many ways of trimming the mushroom shape&#8212;but this is something
    that you will take up in a future lesson.</p>
  <h3> <a name="poke" id="poke"></a>The Poke</h3>
  <p> The poke illustrated (see F) is an absolutely true type. It is often made
        larger or smaller, but the one shown here is the typical shape.</p>
  <p> Be sure that you study the illustration carefully so that you will have
          no difficulty in distinguishing the poke shape from all others. Only
          by learning
          now the names of all millinery shapes can you hope to avoid confusion
          and difficulty in your later work in more advanced millinery.</p>
  <h3><a name="rose" id="rose"></a>Rose Petal Hat</h3>
  <p>You have probably seen this type of hat many times in millinery shops&#8212;but
    did you know its technical, distinguishing name? It is the rose petal hat,
    and the one illustrated here (see D) is the true type. The rim may be wider
    if preferred, and the petals may be as small or as large as one wishes.</p>
  <p> Sometimes it is difficult to obtain the exact rose petal hat you wish.
    In this case it is a simple matter to buy a sailor shape (or make it yourself)
      and cut out the petals yourself. The making of this is taught later in
    the
      course.</p>
  <h3><a name="sailor" id="sailor"></a>The Sailor Shape</h3>
  <p>There is probably no other hat shape which is used in so many varieties
    of styles as the sailor shape. It is shown here with a round crown (see H)
    but it often has a square crown. Each season has its own favorite crown,
    but in the sailor hat the brim always remains the same&#8212;no matter what
    vain Fashion says to the contrary!</p>
  <p>Do not confuse the sailor shape with the mushroom shape. The sailor brim
    is absolutely straight; the mushroom brim droops. They are two distinct shapes.</p>
  <h3><a name="picture" id="picture"></a>The Picture Hat</h3>
  <p>The last of the eight basic millinery shapes is the picture hat. We have
    illustrated two of these shapes for you&#8212;as there are many different
    kinds of picture hats. (See A and G).</p>
  <p>If asked to define a picture hat, the expert milliner would say that it
    is a rather large hat that rolls up on one side and down on the other; or
    that it is straight on one side and rolls on the other. It has a tendency
    to be picturesque&#8212;and one associates it ordinarily with huge plumes,
    or massive flowers, or billows of tulle and lace.</p>
  <h3><a name="point" id="point"></a><em><a href="illus/04-02-end.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',412,242);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/04-02-end-t.jpg" alt="Silhouette of cavalier-dressed young woman" width="113" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Can You Point out the Eight Types of Millinery Shapes?</h3>
  <p>Unless you can, you are not ready to proceed with the next lesson. Before
    you can attempt to begin the construction of hats, you must be able to distinguish
    at once a mushroom shape from a sailor shape, a poke from a turban.</p>
  <p>Review this lesson. Study the text and the illustrations. Then, keeping
    only the page of shape illustrations before you, see if you can name each
    one. Keep at it until you are convinced that you can identify any shape of
    hat as soon as you see it.</p>

  <h3>    <a name="economy" id="economy"></a>Economy Hints for the Milliner</h3>
  <p>A good poet is born, but a good milliner is made. It is by mastering all
    the important details of millinery&#8212;including such important things
    as renovating hat materials, dry cleaning, tinting, etc.&#8212;that one becomes
    an expert in the art of hat-creating.</p>
  <p>This lesson will be devoted to the study of renovating, cleaning, tinting
    and refreshing hat materials. If you are able to whiten a feather that has
    lost its freshness, you will be able to save the price of a new feather;
    if you are able to take apart an old hat and renovate the materials so that
    they can be used in the making of a new hat, you have saved the price of
    new materials. Therefore you see that economy in millinery is quite important
    and should not be neglected by the student.</p>
  <p>The first thing we will consider, in the matter of millinery economy, is
    the renovating of hat materials and trimmings. Let the following pages serve
    as a sort of milliner's guide to you; keep this book always handy, so that
    you can refer to it whenever a question of renovating or tinting arises.</p>
  <h3><a name="renovating" id="renovating"></a>Renovating Hat Materials and Trimmings</h3>
  <p>Naphtha is probably the greatest aid for cleaning purposes, especially in
    the case of light-colored materials and trimmings. Ostrich plumes, for instance,
    and fancies that have become soiled may be cleaned very nicely if one uses
    naphtha. Low grades of gasoline are unfit for cleansing purposes.</p>
  <p>Always use a large, deep china bowl for the naphtha. It should be large
    enough to hold the article to be cleaned without crowding. And be very, very
    careful that you do not use naphtha in a room where there is fire or artificial
    light. It is best to do the cleaning out of doors.</p>
  <p>As naphtha roughens and coarsens the skin, do not keep the hands in the
    fluid longer than is absolutely necessary. Do not use naphtha carelessly,
    as you are likely to have an accident.</p>
  <h3><a name="clean" id="clean"></a>To Clean Ostrich Feathers, Plumes and Fancies</h3>
  <p>The following process for cleaning ostrich plumes and fancies applies only
    to those that are not held together by glue. Use a dry bowl or china dish.
    Pour a pint of naphtha into it and place the feather in with the right side
    up. Gently wash each flue by drawing between the fingers, beginning at the
    stem and working to the point of the feather.</p>
  <p>When you have treated the entire feather in this manner, draw the feather
    in its full length through the closed hand. Then pour out the dirty naphtha&#8212;or
    put it into a small bottle so that it may settle and be used again for cleaning
    some dark material. It cannot be used again on light material. Clean the
    bowl and pour into it a pint of clean naphtha.</p>
  <p>Now add two tablespoonfuls of white flour to the naphtha. Mix thoroughly
    until flour and naphtha have the consistency of a thin paste. Once again,
    wash the feather or fancy by rubbing each flue between the fingers from stem
    to point. Never rub in the other direction. Remove the feather and dry by
    beating lightly on the back of the hand or by shaking in the air. Be sure
    that it is entirely dry, then take the next step.</p>
  <p>Place a piece of fresh tissue paper on the table and sprinkle evenly with
    clean cornstarch. (Use white tissue paper.) Roll the feather in the cornstarch
    until it is thoroughly covered. Then shake it gently in the air until all
    traces of the cornstarch are removed&#8212;and you will find that your feather
    or plume is like new again.</p>
  <p>Dark feathers are differently treated. They are washed in clear wood alcohol,
    just as light feathers are washed in naphtha, and are rinsed in the alcohol.
    Flour and cornstarch should never be used on dark feathers.</p>
  <p>Ornaments made of feathers where glue has been used to' hold them together
    cannot be cleaned satisfactorily, as any cleaning fluid will dissolve the
    glue and so ruin the ornament. Feathers that are only slightly soiled may
    be freshened by sprinkling with powdered magnesia and laying aside for several
    hours. A thorough shaking will remove the magnesia and leave the feather
    fresh and clean. The process may have to be repeated.</p>
  <p>Sometimes wings and fancies made of small feathers become roughened by the
    wind or from careless handling. To prevent this the feathers should be glued
    in place and the whole wing or fancy covered with maline of the same color.
    All trimmings made of feathers wear much better if so covered.</p>
  <p>In handling wood alcohol be very careful, as it is not only inflammable
    but very dangerous. When taken internally it is deadly; when used freely
    on the skin it is dangerous. Both alcohol and naphtha should be used outdoors,
    or at an open window in a room where there is no fire or artificial light.
    If used in a closed room a headache may result.</p>
  <h3><a name="velvets" id="velvets"></a>Renovating Velvets</h3>
  <p>If you wish to use the velvet from an old hat in a new one, you may clean
    and renovate the material very nicely at home. Velvet materials can be stretched
    and pinned in place, then sponged with chloroform. This process removes any
    soiled spots and restores the color.</p>
  <p>When treating velvet in this way, use a small sponge and be sure that the
    bottle containing the chloroform is kept tightly corked. This fluid evaporates
    very quickly, and also has the power of overcoming you if too much of it
    is inhaled. Therefore it is best to work at an open window.</p>
  <p>Velvet bows may be freshened and made to look like new again without even
    removing them from the hat. Use a curling iron. Make it quite hot and then
    cover loosely with a wet cloth. Insert in the loops of the bow, opening the
    curler as wide as the loops demand. The steam will cause the nap of the velvet
    to rise. When dry, the dust can be removed easily with a velvet brush, and
    the bow will appear as good as when new.</p>
  <p>A hat of velvet that appears crushed may be held over the steam and the
    fingers used for re-shaping the folds. This process will freshen the hat,
    and when dry the improvement will be immediately apparent.</p>
  <p>You will probably be surprised to learn that velveteen may be washed without
    injury to its finish. Simply make a lather of pure white soap and hot water,
    rinse the material in it a number of times; repeat the same process in two
    other hot lathers, freshly made, and rinse finally in clear, warm water.
    Add a teaspoonful of salt to a quart of water when washing and rinsing the
    velveteen&#8212; it helps retain the glossy surface. Do not wring out, but
    hang on a line until half dry. Then iron on the wrong side, on a bath towel;
    or, better still, a piece of velveteen with the nap up. The steam will cause
    the pile to rise&#8212;and your velveteen will be like new again.</p>
  <h3><a name="laces" id="laces"></a>To Make Old Laces Like New</h3>
  <p>Laces soil very easily, but there is no reason why they cannot be made to
    look like new again if one wishes to use them on new hats. In fact, laces
    are very easily renovated and with a little care can be made to appear very
    attractive.</p>
  <p>There are several ways of cleaning lace. The method used depends upon the
    quality and strength of the lace. You see, it is very important that the
    delicate threads of the design are not broken; therefore each method is designed
    to meet the requirements of the particular types of lace for which it is
    used.</p>
  <p>Lace should always be soaked before washing. If it is very much soiled,
    use boiling water in which a teaspoonful of borax has been dissolved. The
    usual proportion is two cupfuls of water to every teaspoonful of borax. Having
    soaked the lace, proceed to make a lather of white soap and water. Squeeze
    the lace in this soap-and-water mixture as though it were a sponge, but do
    not rub.</p>
  <p>The best way to wash lace is to put the soap and water into a fruit jar,
    partially filling it, and then placing the lace into it. Seal and shake well
    until the lace is thoroughly cleaned. Then drain the water and add clean,
    tepid water and proceed to shake again. Repeat as many times as necessary.
    Then remove the lace and pin it on a blanket, right side down, placed on
    a table or ironing board. Stretch the lace into position and pin each point
    or scallop in place. Be careful not to break any of the threads. Allow to
    dry on the blanket and press with a warm iron before removing.</p>
  <p>If the lace is cream or ecru, or if it is white and not very much soiled,
    lay out evenly on clean white paper and cover with magnesia. Put another
    sheet of clean white paper on top. Place away inside the leaves of a book,
    or just place away, for two or three days, and then shake out the magnesia.
    The lace will be clean and fresh. If you are not going to use this lace immediately,
    place it in blue paper. Blue paper has a preservative influence over whiteness
    and your lace will not become yellow.</p>
  <p>You may some day have occasion to press black lace. This is the way to do
    it. First sponge with clear water on the right side until quite wet, then
    lay right side down on a black pad. Cover with black cloth and press with
    a hot iron. If done in this manner the lace will have a new, fresh, attractive
    appearance.</p>
  <h3><a name="ribbons" id="ribbons"></a>Renovating Ribbons</h3>
  <p>Ribbons of good quality may be washed&#8212;if carefully done. But the results
    are not quite as satisfactory as dry-cleaning, or when
    certain cleaning fluids are used. To wash, melt white soap and add enough
    warm water to make suds of desired strength. Lift the ribbon up and down
    in the suds and draw through the hand until the soiled spots vanish. You
    may have to use a small brush &#8212;but never rub the spots. To rinse, lift
    up and down in the water&#8212;do not wring, as this will leave creases in
    the ribbon. Put a small amount of powdered borax in the last rinsing.</p>
  <p>Naphtha may be used for cleaning ribbons. Place the ribbon in a fruit jar
    and cover with naphtha or any other cleansing fluid desired. Allow to stand
    for ten minutes, then shake thoroughly. Lift the ribbon out and put into
    another jar, drawing it through the closed hand to remove the fluid first.
    Cover with clean fluid and shake again. Then remove and draw through closed
    hand once again, air thoroughly for several hours, press on the wrong side&#8212;and
    you have renewed ribbon.</p>
  <p>Black ribbons may be successfully renovated by sponging with one-third alcohol
    and two-thirds water. When partly dry, the ribbon should be ironed under
    black crinoline. Have the iron just moderately warm. Remember, alcohol is
    inflammable&#8212;do not have it near fire or intense heat of any kind.</p>
  <p>Colored ribbons may be dipped into a bowl of naphtha to clean them without
    harm to the color. Remember that naphtha is inflammable and very explosive
    when exposed to fire.</p>
  <h3><a name="buckram" id="buckram"></a>Renovating Buckram Frames</h3>
  <p>Buckram frames that have become broken can be restored to their original
    shape very easily. Simply press into shape with warm iron and coat the broken
    places with white shellac.</p>
  <p>As the frame is the foundation of the hat, never use an old, repaired frame
    when a new one can be obtained. However, if you are partial to a certain
    frame, and you wish to use it for another hat, you may change the shape exactly
    as you would change a flat piece of buckram&#8212;by increasing or decreasing
    the diameter at any desired point.</p>
  <p>To straighten out the brim, pressing should be resorted to&#8212; and there
    is nothing like a coat of shellac to add strength to those parts that are
    weakened through bending or careless handling.</p>
  <h3><a name="felt" id="felt"></a>To Renew Felt and Beaver Hats</h3>
  <p>When a light felt hat becomes soiled, or when it loses its freshness, clean
    with naphtha and cornmeal. Rub well until the hat looks fresh and clean again.</p>
  <p>After cleaning with naphtha and cornmeal, it is wise to go over the hat
    with sandpaper. Use OO sandpaper which has been tacked to a piece of wood
    for convenience and go over the whole hat carefully until the nap is lifted.
    Always rub in the same direction, beginning at the center top of the crown
    and working out to the edge of the brim.</p>
  <p>Having completed the sandpaper process, cover another small block of wood
    with velvet, the pile outward. Rub over a hot iron, and when the velvet-covered
    block is warm rub at once over paraffin or beeswax. By brushing the hat with
    this, you will restore the original sheen.</p>
  <p>If a white felt hat becomes greased in any way, you can remove the spots
    with benzine. All ordinary dirt can be removed with soap, water and brush&#8212;although
    one may use the process mentioned above. If you wish to clean the hat thoroughly,
    be sure to remove the lining, band, etc.</p>
  <h3><a name="straw" id="straw"></a>Old Straws</h3>
  <p>Very often old straws are remade into new hats. You will find that straws
    can be made to look like new again with very little effort. Straw that is
    to be resewed should be very carefully ripped and pressed. A great many straws
    cannot be dampened; always try a small piece first. Then, if you find it
    can stand dampening, proceed with the entire amount.</p>
  <p>Light straw can sometimes be cleaned with soap and water, or with naphtha.
    You must experiment first with a small piece to find out which method is
    best. If a light-colored straw hat is only slightly soiled, it can be cleaned
    and refreshed by sprinkling with French chalk or magnesia. Place away for
    a few days, then brush carefully to remove the powder or magnesia. Repeat,
    if necessary, until the hat is fresh and clean.</p>
  <p>Black straw hats can be renewed by brushing over with a polish made from
    pulverized black sealing wax and alcohol. Use one ounce of the former to
    half a pint of the latter. Allow this mixture to stand in a warm place until
    it is about the consistency of cream. Then it can be used on the black straw
    and it will make it look like new again. Shake the bottle containing the
    polish frequently while the contents are dissolving.</p>
  <p>There are many standard preparations for retinting and re-coloring faded
    straws. If you use any of these preparations, bear in mind that they must
    be darker in shade than the original color of the straw.</p>
  <p>Black chip requires only a wiping with an old soft silk handkerchief, followed
    by a light application of pure olive oil, to restore its newness and its
    lustre.</p>
  <h3><a name="silk" id="silk"></a>Cleaning Silks and Satins</h3>
  <p>Some silks can be freshened by washing in warm soap-suds. Japanese, China,
    India and pongee silks can be treated in this way. After washing, rinse quickly
    and dry in the shade. When almost dry, roll in a sheet and iron on the wrong
    side when dry.</p>
  <p>Colored silks cannot be washed in this way, as they fade, and white silks
    become yellow. But these two silks can also be washed and the discoloring
    avoided by using medium warm water, rinsing well, wrapping in a large cloth
    or sheet for a half hour and then ironing on the wrong side. Have the iron
    moderately hot and use a piece of thin lawn between the iron and silk. If
    you wrap carefully in a cloth or sheet while wet, the silk will not discolor,
    as it is the light and air that yellows and fades the fabric.</p>
  <p>To renew old crepe, there is nothing as effective as steam. If you have
    a regular steamer of the improved type, do so; otherwise proceed in this
    manner: Place an iron upturned between two bricks and cover with a damp cloth.
    The iron should be warm enough to cause the cloth to steam. Place the crepe
    or veiling on top of the cloth and move back and forth and from side to side
    quickly. While so doing, brush gently with a soft brush. It is sufficient
    simply to raise and drop the brush in quick succession, in a sort of patting
    motion. You will find that this treatment will renew and refreshen the oldest
    crepe. However, crepe grows shabby very quickly and requires a great deal
    of care. If it is badly soiled, it can be successfully cleaned by brushing
    first and then dipping in naphtha.</p>
  <p>When black silk begins to shine, it may be sponged on the right side with
    a mixture of two parts of alcohol and one of water. Iron while damp on the
    wrong side, and the silk will be like new again. Black satin should be similarly
    sponged with alcohol to restore and cleanse it. Taffeta can be washed in
    warm suds, but should seldom be cleaned with naphtha, as this causes it to
    crack.</p>
  <p>You will probably find that, even after cleaning and refreshing, silks and
    velvets are seldom suitable for use in making plain hats. But they may be
    used very nicely for such purposes as shirred or draped crowns and brims.</p>
  <p>If a greasy substance has been dropped on silk, the spot can be removed
    by mixing French chalk with methylated spirits until it is of the consistency
    of cream, laying it upon the stain, covering with a brown paper and pressing
    with a warm iron. French chalk will be found to remove grease from colored
    silks without injury. Simply scrape a little of the chalk on the spot rub
    it in gently, allow it to stand unmolested for twenty-four hours and then
    brush off. As grease is often hard to remove, it may be necessary to repeat
    this process once again.</p>
  <h3><a name="panama" id="panama"></a>Panama Hats</h3>
  <p>Unless one has had a great deal of experience and is quite deft, one cannot
    hope to clean Panama hats successfully at home. It is always best to send
    the Panama hat to a professional, as they know just how to handle the cleaning
    and blocking. A good Panama hat will stand many trips to the cleaners, and
    will come back each time fresh and attractive. It is made in one piece and
    must be so handled that the shape and style is retained.</p>
  <h3><a name="flowers" id="flowers"></a>Refreshing Flowers</h3>
  <p>By using a soft brush and water colors mixed with naphtha, old flowers can
    be retouched at home. The work must be done carefully. A great deal of retouching
    can be done if the flowers are so used that they may be covered with maline.</p>
  <p>Naphtha is used frequently and with much success in cleaning flowers. Fill
    a bowl with naphtha and dip the flower into it, keeping the flower upside
    down. If the first application does not clean the soiled spots, repeat until
    the flower is fresh and clean. Then place it aside to air for a few days,
    so that there will be no odor of naphtha. When you are quite sure that the
    naphtha has evaporated sufficiently, hold the flower in the steam of a teakettle
    and reshape the petals with the fingers. You may find it necessary to retouch
    faded or streaked parts with water colors, mixed with naphtha.</p>
  <p>To touch up the petals of a flower, use a small camel's hair brush. Be sure
    to have a correct proportion of naphtha to the water color&#8212;and keep
    away from fire or flame.</p>
  <p>Almost all flowers can be made to look fresh and new by shaking gently over
    a steaming cloth. Flowers of silk, muslin, sateen or velvet can be treated
    in this way.</p>
  <h3><a name="hints" id="hints"></a>Some Helpful Hints</h3>
  <p>Old velvet that has become faded can be stretched on the ironing board before
    an open window and sponged with chloroform. This not only removes the soiled
    spots, but helps to restore the color. Velvet can always be steamed to lift
    the pile; lay on a damp cloth over an upturned iron and, while the steam
    is rising, pass the wrong side of the velvet over it, allowing the steam
    to pass through the velvet and thus lift the pile.</p>
  <p>Chiffon, maline, net, veilings and other thin materials can be refreshed
    by steaming and pressing. These materials do not require as much steam as
    does velvet.</p>
  <p>Laces, chiffon, net and other similar materials can be cleaned in naphtha
    and then dipped in paint mixed with naphtha. In this manner many attractive
    shades and shaded effects can be obtained. Always bear in mind that when
    the material is damp the color will be much more vivid than when dry. Make
    allowances for this. Do not use any water in these paints, as only one drop
    will spoil all your work.</p>
  <p>An old velvet hat which has been worn until it has become shabby can be
    refreshed by holding in the steam of a teakettle until the nap is lifted.
    But be careful that the buckram frame does not soften. If the hat is soiled,
    it can be cleaned by dipping a new paint brush in naphtha and brushing the
    hat thoroughly with it.</p>
  <p>Ammonia is an excellent color restorer. If they are not too faded, colored
    hats can be greatly freshened by covering with a cloth which has been wrung
    out of half a pint of hot water to which a teaspoonful of ammonia has been
    added. After this treatment place a warm iron over the cloth and press the
    brim into shape.</p>
  <p>Ruchings can be cleaned without taking out the little crinkles by dipping
    in naphtha. This makes them look clean and fresh, but does not detract from
    the dainty fluffiness.</p>
  <h3><a name="tint" id="tint"></a>Tinting</h3>
  <p>Velvet, chiffon, maline, net, georgette crepe and laces can be dyed successfully
    at home. Tinting is not a difficult process, but requires great care. Following
    are the colors that can be produced by mixing with naphtha. The shade obtained
    depends entirely upon the amount of paint used:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Alizarin Carmine	and naphtha equals Bright Red</li>
    <li> Black and Venetian and naphtha equals  Chocolate Brown</li>
    <li> Burnt Umber and naphtha equals  Brown</li>
    <li> Black and naphtha equals  Gray</li>
    <li> Black and Light Green and naphtha equals  Dark Green</li>

  <h3><a name="need" id="need"></a>What You Will Need for Tinting</h3>
  <p>In addition to the tube paints mentioned, there are several articles you
    will need in your tinting. You should have a tin pan, a large china washbowl,
    a small bristle brush and about a gallon of naphtha.</p>
  <p>In tinting, always bear in mind that the least drop of water or moisture
    in the bowl will ruin the work and produce bad results. Tinting should never
    be done near a fire or gas light&#8212;but as near as possible to an open
    window and outdoors if possible.</p>
  <p>Before beginning the actual business of tinting, suppose we give you some
    general instructions. Read them carefully&#8212;they will prove valuable.
    In the first place, always keep the tops of your tubes screwed tightly in
    order to prevent the paint from hardening or becoming dirty. Use a clean,
    dry cloth to wipe the bowl and brush before commencing to tint. Be sure that
    the paint is completely dissolved&#8212;otherwise you are liable to spot
    the material. Sufficient naphtha should be used in the bowl to cover completely
    the material to be tinted.</p>
  <h3><a name="dry" id="dry"></a>Dry Tinting Laces</h3>
  <p>To tint lace a handsome cream color, mix yellow ochre with corn meal. The
    proportions depend on the shade desired. Place the mixture in a box and drop
    the lace in on top of it. Shake well until the lace is covered entirely with
    the ochre and meal. Then remove the lace and shake thoroughly. If the lace
    is too light in shade, add more ochre; if too dark, add more meal. It is
    best to test the mixture beforehand with a small piece of lace. This mixture
    can be used over and over again for tinting lace. If you wish, you may substitute
    corn starch for the corn meal.</p>
  <p>Many paints come in powdered form and can be had in various shades and colors.
    Any of these colors can be mixed with corn meal or corn starch just as the
    ochre was used. Great care must be taken that the meal and paint are thoroughly
    mixed before the lace is added.</p>
  <p>These powdered paints are ideal for tinting beaver hats. After the powder
    has been applied and the beaver is the correct shade, it should be combed
    with a fine steel comb. This dry-tinting process is not successful on smooth
    surfaces, while on the other hand, liquid tinting causes felt and beaver
    to spot so that it can never be used on hats of these materials. Dry-tinting
    is often used successfully on velvets.</p>
  <h3><a name="liquid" id="liquid"></a>Liquid Tinting</h3>
  <p>To use your paints and alcohol for liquid tinting, open the tube and squeeze
    a small amount of the tube paint in the bottom of a bowl or pan. Now pour
    out a small quantity of naphtha and use the brush for mixing and dissolving
    the paint. Be sure that the paint is thoroughly dissolved before proceeding.</p>
  <p>Into this paint and alcohol solution you have just made, dip a small sample
    of the material to be tinted. This will show you exactly the shade that will
    be produced by the paint. If you find that it is darker than you desired,
    add more naphtha; if too light, add more paint.</p>
  <p>There are three paints that are very strong and will require very little
    in order to obtain a delicate shade. They are Prussian blue, burnt umber
    and black.</p>
  <h3><a name="whiten" id="whiten"></a>To Whiten Feathers</h3>
  <p>It often happens that feathers, from handling or exposure, become yellow.
    If you wish to use the feather again, it can be whitened very easily at home.
    First clean and rinse quickly in naphtha and then dry thoroughly in the open
    air. Place away in an air-tight box and expose to sulphur fumes. If you prefer,
    you can send the cleaned feather to a professional to be bleached.</p>
  <p>Another method of whitening feathers, is to plunge into naphtha, rinse in
    a second dish of naphtha and dry in the open air. Then seal in an air-tight
    box and expose to strong sulphur fumes.</p>
  <p>White felt hats can be successfully cleaned with soap and water. Use a soft
    brush. Always remove the lining, band and trimmings before doing this work.
    The hat is very liable to shrink however.</p>
  <p>To clean chiffon hats, cover with powdered French chalk and lay away for
    a day or two. Then remove all traces of the chalk with a soft brush. If the
    hat is not clean, repeat the process until it is.</p>
  <p>You can clean white fur and white knitted garments by rubbing white flour
    or corn meal into them. Lay away for several days and then brush thoroughly
    to remove the flour. Repeat if the garment is not fresh and clean.</p>

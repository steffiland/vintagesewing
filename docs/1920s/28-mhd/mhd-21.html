  <h3>    <a name="children" id="children"></a>Making Hats for Children</h3>
  <p>There is nothing radically different in making a hat for a child. If you
    know how to make a hat for yourself, you will have no difficulty whatever
    in making attractive little hats for the youngsters. However, there are certain
    important features you must bear in mind in designing and making hats for
    young children&#8212;and others that have important bearings on the making
    of hats for misses.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illus/21-01-fig1.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',483,473);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/21-01-fig1-t.jpg" alt="Figure 1" width="196" height="195" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Children begin to wear hats when they are about three or four years old,
    or sometimes younger. Until that time they wear neat little bonnets like
    Fig. I. These bonnets should fit perfectly, and should not be too loose nor
    too tight. They are usually white or pale blue or pink in color, for these
    colors are most restful to the infant's eyes, and besides pink and white
    are baby colors, anyhow. These bonnets should be trimmed very simply, and
    lined with soft mull or silk. There should be nothing that can irritate the
    tender baby skin either on the cap or on the trimmings.</p>
  <p>When the youngster begins to wear a hat, mother is naturally proud&#8212;and
    often forgets that the little head still needs protection. Harsh straw hats,
    irritating flowers and coarse materials should be avoided. At the present
    time, hats for small children are rather plain; they are not trimmed so much
    with rosettes of chiffon, crepe or silk as they were years ago. However,
    this is perfectly permissible if you care to make them more elaborate. For
    every day wear other types that I have pictured are far more practical with
    most types of clothing.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illus/21-02-fig2.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',540,478);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/21-02-fig2-t.jpg" alt="Figure 2" width="176" height="194" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Of course, if the little lady is to take an important part in a wedding
    ceremony, her hat will be more elaborate and will be trimmed with ribbons
    or dainty appropriate flowers.</p>
  <p>As the child gets older the type of hat changes somewhat. It begins to be
    more like those worn by big sister and mother. Flowers may be used on hats
    if they are well chosen and not overdone. Simple ribbon trimmings such as
    bows or a band and streamers are very attractive. If the child can have several
    hats, a pretty summer one may be trimmed with small flowers and very fine
    fern. Feathers and elaborate trimmings are absolutely in bad form, and should
    not be worn by young children.</p>
  <p>Even the young miss should avoid any ostentation in headgear. Up to the
    age of fourteen or perhaps older, the hat should 
    be simple and comfortable, boasting neither feathers nor fancies, but the
    trimming should be in good taste. Flowers may be used if carefully chosen
    and artistically applied. Bows are neat and sometimes the hat is made exceptionally
    plain with a band around the crown. The tam-o-shanter is ideal for school
    wear, and the mushroom hat is most appropriate for dress-up occasions. But
    no matter what the type of hat is, the keynote should be simplicity.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illus/21-03-fig3.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',561,485);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/21-03-fig3-t.jpg" alt="Figure 3" width="172" height="194" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>The hat shapes most commonly used for children are of the blocked variety.
    By this we mean they are hats made and shaped in the factory and purchased
    ready-to-wear. Fig. 3 will give you an idea of this kind of hat, though I
    am sure you have seen plenty of them. These hats are sometimes made of straw
    or very often of felt. The only trimming is a band of ribbon around the crown,
    with a small bow at the side or the ribbon is sometimes allowed to hang down
    the back to form streamers.</p>
  <p>The blocked hats may be purchased untrimmed, and any desired, but still
    appropriate trimming added. If the hat is of straw a dainty bunch of flowers
    may be applied or as already mentioned the ribbon with streamers is particularly
    attractive. It is often a saving of time to purchase children's hats in this
    manner.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illus/21-04-fig4.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,415);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/21-04-fig4-t.jpg" alt="Figure 4" width="132" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Fabric hats for children are made 
    very much in the same manner as fabric hats for older people. The poke bonnet,
      or the hat shown in Fig. 4 is really quite 
    simple to make. The shape is made exactly as taught in an earlier lesson,
    on shapes for adults. It may be covered with velvet or silk in the same way
    as our own hats are covered, and the trimmings are applied with the same
    regard for harmony and good taste. The routine of the work is precisely the
    same except that the facing on the child's hat is usually a soft, draped
    facing instead of the stretched type. This does not always hold true, however,
    so if you desire a stretched facing in preference to the soft draped kind,
    it will be perfectly all right to apply it in this way.</p>
  <p>Making children's hats devolves itself consequently into the very simple
    matter of learning what shapes are most youthful, what materials are most
    appropriate, and what types of trimmings are most flattering to the little
    faces.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illus/21-05-fig5.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,435);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/21-05-fig5-t.jpg" alt="Figure 5" width="138" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>As for the little boy, you will find that it is a much wiser plan to purchase
    his hats ready-made. It is a simpler way for these hats are usually made
    of very heavy material. Fig. 5 shows one style that is appropriate for the
    small boy. However, there are several types of hats for boys that can be
    easily made at home, and that offer a profitable &quot;side line&quot; if
    you con-_ template opening your own millinery shop.</p>
  <p>There is, for instance, the &quot;roly-poly&quot; hat for the very young
    person of three or four. In the summer, it is made of pique, linen or chambray
    to match the suit. In winter it is made of felt or tweed. The crown is made
    in four sections coming together in a point at the top. The brim of the hat
    is made in two pieces, and a covered button is usually used for trimming.</p>
  <p>For the boy who is a little older, the sailor cap is appropriate. It is
    made with an interlining to help it to roll smoothly. A thin layer of wadding
    is used. For inside the head band, fold a piece of lining over wrapping paper
    and join the lining to this head band. The lining should be stitched to the
    hat around the bottom.</p>
  <h3><a name="tam" id="tam"></a>Making the Tam-O-Shanter</h3>
  <p class="clear">There<em><a href="illus/21-07-fig7.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,681);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/21-07-fig7-t.jpg" alt="Figure 7" width="220" height="198" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em> are <em><a href="illus/21-06-fig6.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,569);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/21-06-fig6-t.jpg" alt="Figure 6" width="183" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>several types of tams, as they are today commonly called. The
    true Scotch tam is made of two circular pieces of cloth, the upper being
    a plain circle and the lower having the headsize cut into it. Instead of
    the band or finish coming below this opening, the finish extends up into
    the cap giving the appearance of having no head band. Fig. 7 shows the finished
    headsize of a tam. This is the true Scotch hat, and the headsize is never
    cut exactly in the center but a little to one side. This 
    gives the hat a rakish appearance&#8212;but the kiddies look so delightful
    in them.</p>
  <p>Do not confuse the tam for children, with the tam-o-shanter crown used on
    ladies' hats. The latter is made over a shape or foundation which holds the
    shape in position. The tams for children are never made over a foundation,
    while without a foundation a tam-o-shanter crown would never be appropriate
    for a woman's hat. Let 
    us see exactly how the tam-o-shanter for the child is made.</p>
  <p>1. Select your material. Plaids are attractive for children as they do not
    soil easily.</p>
  <p>2. Cut two circles, each about 12 in. in diameter. The size of these circles
    may vary according to the size of the child's head.</p>
  <p>3. Mark the headsize in the piece that is to form the under part of the
    crown. Make it an oblong opening not perfectly round.</p>
  <p>4. Now measure the child's head. Pretending that the measure is 21 inches,
    the diameter of the circle for the headsize would be seven inches minus a
    very small fraction.</p>
  <p>5. Place your circle of cloth on the table, and mark a line straight through
    the circle from center front to center back. Use tailors' chalk.</p>
  <p>6.	Proceed to mark another line through the center from side to side.</p>
  <p>7. As the headsize must not be perfectly round, make the headsize eight
    inches from the center of the front to the center of the back; and make it
    six inches from side to side.</p>
  <p>8. Three inches from the center on each side of the line running from the
    front to the back, make a small mark with tailors' chalk.</p>
  <p>9. Do the same on each side of the line running from side to side, but this
    time make it four inches from the center.</p>
  <p>10.	Connect these points with a curved line.</p>
  <p>11. If your line is properly made, it will measure 21 inches. One inch inside
    of this line draw another curved line 
    every point of which is
    exactly one inch from the
    outer circle. The outer circle is the headsize; the inner circle
is the line on which to cut the opening. Fig. 6 shows this.</p>
  <p>12. Proceed to cut this opening and slash the edge towards the headsize
    line in order that the hat will fit comfortably on the child's head. It is
    wise, at this point, to fit the hat and see that it is just right.</p>
  <p>13. Now make a line of very small bastings at the headsize line with heavy
    basting thread, and fasten well. This marks the headsize line, and keeps
    it from stretching. Be sure to handle your work with care, as you are working
    on bias material and you are very likely to stretch the material if you are
    not careful.</p>
  <p>14. The two sections may be put together with a plain seam or a cord or
    piping may be used. For a plain seam place the right sides of both pieces
    together, being sure that the grains of the cloth run in the same way. Baste
    carefully a small even seam all around the edge, and to this line baste a
    narrow tape. Stitch this seam by machine, remove the bastings and turn the
    cap through to the right side. </p>
  <p>15. Now draw the seam out so the stitching comes directly at the edge of
    the cap. Baste in position and press very lightly, placing a cloth over the
    material to protect it.</p>
  <p>16. Now make your band for the headsize. Cut a strip of tailor's canvas
    or buckram not over an inch and a half wide and long enough to fit the child's
    head. In this case it is 21 inches. Allow enough to lap and finish&#8212;about
    an inch at each end.</p>
  <p>17.	Lap over and join.</p>
  <p>18. Cut a strip of the cap material wide enough to cover this and lap over
    the edges at least one-half inch.</p>
  <p>19. Join this in a circle and cover the headsize band, basting the material
    neatly and firmly in place.</p>
  <p>20. With the seam at the center of the back, pin the cap to this band and
    be sure the headsize just matches the edge of the band. Baste in place.</p>
  <p>21. The slashes that have been cut inside the headsize of the cap will allow
    the material to fit flat against the band. After it is basted in place, a
    line of stitching may be run along the top of the band and one at the bottom.</p>
  <p>22. Make a lining exactly like the cap and put inside with the seams against
    the seams of the cap.</p>
  <p>23. Baste in position and with a straight piece of material finish the inside
    of the head band.</p>
  <p>24. To finish, trim with a tassel, a small pompon or a small bow of ribbon.
    If you use a tassel or pompon place it on the top of the hat; a ribbon is
    applied to the headsize band and the ends hang down over the hair.</p>
  <p>If this is to be a true Scotch tam, the headsize band will extend up into
    the cap instead of coming down over the head as shown in Fig. 7. If the edge
    of the cap is to be corded, make the cord by cutting a bias strip of material,
    using the cutting gauge on the scissors to gauge the width. Set the gauge
    on C. Cover a small cord with the material and baste the cord firmly in position
    before applying to the cap. When the cord is firmly fixed in its casing,
    baste the raw edge of the cord covering exactly even with the edge of one
    section of the crown, having the cord on the right side of the crown material.
    Baste the two sections together, making the line of stitching as close to
    the cord as possible. Turn the cap through to the right side and finish exactly
    as the plain tam is finished.</p>
  <p class="clear">    <em><a href="illus/21-08-fig8.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,443);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/21-08-fig8-t.jpg" alt="Figure 8" width="141" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>The headsize measure which is taken on the child's head is the circumference
      of the circle. The diameter will be approximately one-third of this measure.
      We take one-third of the head-size measure which gives us the diameter
      of the circle. But as it is to be an oblong instead of a circle, the diameter
      is longer from front to back, and the amount added to it is subtracted
      from the diameter from side to side.</p>
  <p>Other tams for children are made by cutting a circle of material large
    enough to 
    make the top of the crown and double back on the underside of the headsize.
    The material is gathered or pleated and joined to the headsize band just
    as the flat tam is joined. A &quot;cap of this kind is usually cut about
    eighteen inches in diameter, but may vary in accordance with the size of
    the child's head.</p>
  <h3><a name="match" id="match"></a>Hats to Match Dresses</h3>
  <p>Every mother desires to dress her little girl just as nice as she possibly
    can. She loves to have her friends compliment her on
    the attractive dress or hat she has made. We are now going to suggest ways
    of making little hats to match attractive play clothes.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illus/21-09-fig9.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',574,488);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/21-09-fig9-t.jpg" alt="Figure 9" width="169" height="196" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Fig. 9 would look just ever so neat with a little dress made of the same
    material and trimmed with white or the predominating color in the figured
    material. I would suggest that you make a buckram or crinoline frame which
    would exactly fit the little head. This particular hat is made with the round
    crown drape, strip around the crown and a circle applied at the top before
    the bias part is sewed on. The brim may be made to roll down or up just as
    you prefer. The poke bonnet shape is youthful and makes up very well in gingham
    or printed cotton materials.</p>
  <p>It should not be necessary for me to go into a detailed explanation of how
    to cover brims and crowns for this has been taken up so thoroughly in an
    earlier lesson. A dainty design may be embroidered on one or both sides of
    the brim, especially if the brim is covered with plain material. The edge
    is neat if finished with the blanket stitch done in black embroidery thread
    and a ribbon around the crown with a bow at the back gives just the right
    finish.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illus/21-10-fig10.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',519,483);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/21-10-fig10-t.jpg" alt="Figure 10" width="186" height="191" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Fig. 10 shows another attractive model with the wide brim in front, disappearing
    as it reaches the back. This little hat or 
    bonnet is easy to make and is especially nice for it shades the eyes and
    is so appropriate for play time wear. The crown is soft and is made of figured
    cotton material. A piece of heavy muslin may be used to make a little better
    foundation or crinoline may be cut the same size as the outside material
    and basted together at the edges. The brim could be made of buckram and the
    crown material carefully plaited to fit the headsize. 
    Ribbon could be used to cover the joining or a piece of the material cut
    on the bias.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illus/21-11-fig11.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',581,472);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/21-11-fig11-t.jpg" alt="Figure 11" width="161" height="194" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Fig. 11 could be made without a heavy foundation material. The crown could
    be made similar to Fig. 9 and the scalloped brim stiffened by means of crinoline
    or muslin inserted between the upper and lower covering. If you desire, the
    scalloped brim could be starched a little. This would make a nice play hat
    and could be easily laundered when it became necessary. Of course, if you
    wish to make it with the stiff foundation, follow the directions for making
    the rose petal hat. Notice the attractive touch of hand embroidery in each
    scalloped and blanket stitch, used to finish the edge.</p>
  <p>If you will refer to some of the recent magazines, I am sure that you can
    find many more attractive styles. Often good ideas may be gained from the
    cuts in the newspapers, especially the advertising section.</p>
  <h3><a name="organdie" id="organdie"></a>Organdie Hats</h3>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illus/21-12-fig12.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',526,474);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/21-12-fig12-t.jpg" alt="Figure 12" width="179" height="193" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>I think Fig. 12 is so very attractive. This model is wide at the front and
    becomes narrow towards the back. Notice the attractive little frill which
    encircles the hat and gives it the baby style and still a wee touch of grown
    up air. The crown is full and may be made from a circle of material, if you
    do not have a pattern.</p>
  <p>It is really hard to Choose exactly what to use to make this little hat.
    White or pastel shades of organdie are attractive&#8212;let us say yellow,
    orchid, blue or pink. It depends on the color of eyes and hair just what
    color should be selected. Dotted Swiss also makes up nicely either in all
    white or red or blue dotted material.</p>
  <p>In order to finish these little hats in 
    exactly the right way a piece of black velvet placed in the center of the
      frill is applied. This may be varied by the use of a bias fold of any color
      that will go well with the dress.</p>
  <p>Some fashion companies have patterns for making many attractive kinds of
    hats for small children, but I am sure that you will be able to cut paper
    patterns and make the hats without the additional expense.</p>
  <h3><a name="baby" id="baby"></a>For the Baby and Infant</h3>
  <p>Very young people need hats, too, you know&#8212;and these hats are quite
    as important as mother's best! They are meant solely as head coverings, but
    everyone knows that they must have a certain amount of style.</p>
  <p>Who ever heard of a baby's hat without dainty ruffles and bows&#8212;and
    at least one tiny flower? Who ever heard of infants' caps without plenty
    of lace and ribbons? They have a style of their own, these miniature designs
    in headgear.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illus/21-13-fig13.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,299);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/21-13-fig13-t.jpg" alt="Figure 13" width="93" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>For the tiny person whose head must be prettily covered with a cap, the
    shirred bonnet is best. It may be made of cashmere,  
    bengaline, India silk or satin. For trimming it may boast white swansdown,
    lace, baby ribbons, ruchings or tiny flowers.</p>
  <p>Of course hats and caps for babies can be purchased very easily ready-made,
    but what fond mother wants her little son or daughter to wear a factory-made
    hat when she can make it with her own fingers? A yard and a half of yard-wide
    silk is sufficient for the pretty bonnet pictured here. First you must cut
    the circular piece for the back, and then the bias strips for hood, ties
    and lining. Proceed according to these step-by-step directions and you will
    have no trouble.</p>
  <p>1. From a corner of the silk, cut a circular piece 12 inches in diameter.
    This is for the back. The bonnet we are going to make here is for a child
    from one to two years of age; for a younger child, or a child with an exceptionally
    small head, you 
    can make the circular piece 10 or 11 inches in diameter.</p>
  <p>2. One-half inch from the edge, all around the circular piece you have just
    prepared, run a shirring thread and draw up the circle on this thread until
    it measures 20 inches. It should fit the child's head comfortably.</p>
  <p>3. Now take the measurement for the bonnet. Place one end of the material
    at the point in the middle of the neck on one side, measure the material
    up across the ear, over the top of the head, down across the other ear to
    the middle of the neck on the opposite side. This measurement is usually
    from sixteen to eighteen inches.</p>
  <p>4. Fold the material in such manner that a perfect bias can be cut with
    as little waste as possible. The bias edge 
    should measure at least 36 inches.</p>
  <p>5. From the 36-inch bias edge cut a strip of silk measuring 8 inches. This
    should be cut on the selvedge and used for one tie and loops at the side
    of the bonnet.</p>
  <p>6. Now cut another bias strip measuring 10 inches wide and 26 inches long
    when cut off square at the ends. Use this strip for the shirred piece that
    fits over the top of the head. Let us see exactly how this shirred piece
    is made.</p>
  <p>7. The strip is shirred over the cords. Turn one bias edge under to a depth
    of 11/4 inches.</p>
  <p>8. On the upper or outer side of the silk, make a quarter inch tuck over
    a cording. The raw edge should be sewed fast by the row of stitching forming
    the tuck. The material is simply doubled over the cord, the line of stitching
    being run parallel to the cord and through all three thicknesses of the material.
    This will form a cord and a double ruffle. The ruffle finishes the bonnet
    around the face. The cord, however, must not be sewed fast, as it must be
    free to slip inside the tuck. You may find it easier to make a tuck and then
    draw the cord through this.</p>
  <p>9. Now turn the other edge under one-half inch in the same manner and proceed
    to make the second tuck. The stitching of this tuck being just far enough
    from the turned edge to make a tuck large enough to accommodate the cord.</p>
  <p>10. Two additional tucks must now be made at equal distances between the
    first two. Be sure that the cords you use are at least 24 inches long.</p>
  <p>11.	Draw up the cord in the second tuck you made&#8212;the tuck at the bottom
    of the piece. Tie the ends together forming a circle 20 inches around.</p>
  <p>12. Draw up the material in the other tucks, but do not tie them. The tuck
    immediately above the one you have just pre pared should be drawn up to measure
    17 inches from one end to the other. The tuck above this one is drawn up
    to 161/2 inches.</p>
  <p>13. Now find the center of the cap at the top of the back tuck. This will
    be 10 inches from the joining at the back of the neck. Stick a pin in the
    silk to indicate this point.</p>
  <p>14. Mark also with pins the middle points at both the right and left sides.
    These points will be 5 inches from the joining of the cord at the back.</p>
  <p>15. Divide the circumference of the circular piece that forms the back of
    the bonnet into four equal parts, being sure that you first even up the shirring.</p>
  <p>16. Sew this circular piece to the back of the shirred piece, along the
    line of the last tuck, the tuck which is 20 inches around. Use short, neat
    stitches.</p>
  <p>17. Fit the bonnet to the child's head and draw up or let out the fullness
    on the cords as you find necessary. Now cut the ends of the cords off even
    with the edge of the material. Sew them down firmly so that they cannot pull
    out of the tucks. </p>
  <p>18. Finish the ends of the tucked strip with neat half-inch hems and the
    shirred piece and the top of the hat is finished.</p>
  <p>19. You already have one tie. The second is cut from the silk 8 inches on
    the selvedge which will make it 6 1/2 inches across from one bias cut to
    the other. The strips for the ties should be 36 inches long&#8212;20 inches
    being for the tie and the remaining 16 inches being for the rosettes at the
    sides.</p>
  <p>20. Hem both ties on the sewing machine, or with fine hand made hems. Hem
    the bottom also, with hems of the same width.</p>
  <p>21. Arrange the top 16 inches of the tie into four or five small loops,
    arranging them attractively in the form of a rosette. Attach firmly to the
    bonnet at the sides, near the corners.</p>
  <p>22. You must now make a lining for the bonnet. From the silk or material
    still remaining, cut a strip of bias sufficiently deep to line the bonnet.
    Sew into the front at the first cord with a neat buttonhole stitch.</p>
  <p>23. Now turn the lining back over the stitching and allow plenty of fullness
    for the inside of the cap. Attach to the back with tiny overhanding stitches.</p>
  <p>The little bonnet you have finished may be made of silk, cotton, velvet,
    almost any material you desire. After a little practice you should be able
    to make pretty hats like these quickly and easily&#8212;adding original touches
    that make the little hats more charming than those that can be purchased
    ready made. Don't let this lesson slip by without mastering it thoroughly.</p>

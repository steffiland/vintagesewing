  <h3>    Ready-Made Trimmings</h3>
  <h3><a name="subject" id="subject"></a>On the Subject of Trimmings</h3>
  <p>So fascinating is the subject of millinery trimmings and so vast in its
    possibilities, that volumes could be written on the subject. There was a
    time when the art of trimming in millinery meant merely a touch of fancy
    work on a hat&#8212;a touch of hand embroidery, a beaded motif, a flower
    or wing attached to the crown. But today millinery trimming means infinitely
    more; it embraces every law of art, symmetry and harmony; every law of color,
    line and form.</p>
  <p>When we speak of trimming now, we do not mean solely the delicately-colored
    flowers that we arrange in attractive manner around the hat, or the frail
    golden threads of a motif design, or the jet and jade ornaments which are
    Fashion's pets. Trimming today concerns itself also with the artful arrangement
    of drapery, with the blending of well-chosen colors, with the achieving of
    a true expression of art.</p>
  <p>Trimming a hat does not necessarily require the aid of Fashion&#8212;although
    Fashion usually determines the type of trimming. One may use a bit of antique
    tapestry, or old-fashioned cross-stitch work, or even an old, cherished Bird
    of Paradise. But if the trimming is set at just the right angle, if the colors
    blend in perfect harmony, if the symmetry is correct, the trimming will be
    modern in its chic smartness.</p>
  <p>Milliners the world over have been particularly clever in creating new trimming
    innovations and many have proven extremely deft and artistic in the arrangement
    of material draperies, in the placing of motifs, in the artful conception
    of trimming ideas. It is to the eternal credit of the men and women who have
    devoted their talents to the designing and making of hats, that millinery
    has advanced more in the last twenty years than during any other period.
    By &quot;advanced&quot; we mean that the styles have become more sensible
    and attractive, color harmony has made a most pronounced stride forward,
    trimming mediums have increased tenfold. </p>
  <p>The ordinary interpretation of &quot;trimming&quot; in millinery is something
    to &quot;dress up&quot; the hat&#8212;perhaps a bit of something colorful,
    a fancy, or a feather. But the wise milliner knows that she can take something
    commonplace, like a beaded design, or a feather, or a bow, and with it create
    a trimming that will be a work of art. This subject will be covered completely
    a little later in the course. You will be taught enough about design in millinery
    to enable you to transform the commonplace into the artistic and beautiful.
    But for the present, while you are still in the embryonic stage of millinery
    art, let us just consider the types of trimmings and when they are used.</p>
  <h3><a name="feather" id="feather"></a>Feather Trimmings</h3>
  <p>The vogue for feathers on milady's hat, which increases with one season
    and decreases in another, has created an industry of surprising proportions.
    Bird-farming, it is called, and it consists of the deliberate growing of
    feathers for millinery purposes. Of course it is not the feathers that are
    grown&#8212;but the birds which supply the feathers. Think of being able
    to go out into one's back yard and gathering just the size or shade of feather
    one wishes for the new Spring, Summer or Winter hat!</p>
  <p>The lure of pheasant-raising is very dear to the feather fancier's heart.
    He takes great pride in the exquisitely colored feathers, the fine, delicate
    flues. The ideal time for &quot;pulling&quot; feathers that are to be sold
    is June or July. At this time the plumage is prime and the bird has not yet
    begun to shed. If the wing feathers of the pheasant are to be used, they
    are drawn in October.</p>
  <p>The feather has to go through a great many processes, of course, before
    it is ready for milady's hat! Women are more deft than men in the use of
    dyes and bleaches, and at many of the large bird-farms women are employed
    for this purpose. When the feather emerges from their hands, it is indeed
    a thing of rare beauty&#8212;and a rich trimming for one's best hat.</p>
  <h3><a name="when" id="when"></a>When Feathers Were First Used in Millinery </h3>
  <p> There was a time when feathers were unheard of as trimmings of any kind.
        The first instance we know of when a feather of any kind was used as
    headgear was when a certain Scotch clan used tiny tips of ostrich feathers
    in their
        caps to distinguish themselves from other clans. This was about four
    centuries ago.</p>
  <p>About three centuries ago, feathers began to be used extensively on the
    hats of men. Women did not wear them at all, and in fact, 
    they were not allowed to wear them at first! Tradition tells us that the
    feather was a sign of masculine strength&#8212;and what strength had a mere
    woman!</p>
  <p>Finally we find that the feather has taken an entirely new place in the
    scheme of things. The milliner has finally claimed the feather as her own&#8212;and
    now we find the use of the feather headdress confined solely to women. Of
    course there are certain military organizations that favor the feather for
    men&#8212;but they usually limit themselves to the ostrich feather alone.</p>
  <p>And so, the feather constitutes an important feature in millinery trimming,
    and we will study each type of feather individually.</p>
  <h3><a name="ostrich" id="ostrich"></a>The Feathers of the Ostrich</h3>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illus/11-01-fig1.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,522);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/11-01-fig1-t.jpg" alt="Figure 1. Ostrich feather" width="167" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>The ostrich plume is probably the prettiest type of feather used in millinery.
    Ostrich-farms in the United States and South Africa supply the plumes which
    are clipped every six months. The feathers from the male ostrich are finer
    than those of the female; they are black or white in color, while those of
    the female are a greyish brown.</p>
  <p>The single plume is used very rarely for a trimming. The full, thick ostrich
    plume is made up of one feather of which the quill is perfect, built up underneath
    with less perfect feathers to give the required weight. The feathers are
    bleached and dyed, then starched, and finally curled.</p>
  <p>It is important that ostrich feathers be kept out of damp places, for dampness
    has the tendency to take out the curl. When stored, they should be placed
    in a dry spot, not against a brick wall, and carefully protected from light
    and air.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illus/11-02-fig2.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,466);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/11-02-fig2-t.jpg" alt="Figure 2. Ostrich feather" width="149" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Sometimes uncurled ostrich feathers are used. Sometimes Fashion will have
    a whim&#8212;and for a whole season nothing but uncurled ostrich feathers
    will be worn. They are prepared in many attractive ways. They may be used
    on dressy hats and on tailored hats. By observing styles each season you
    will be able to get many more valuable and up-to-date ideas than could possibly
    be given in this course. (Fig. 2.)</p>
  <p>Many fancies are made of ostrich feathers&#8212;and sometimes a whole
    hat is covered with the feathers. The willow plume which was so extremely
    popular at one time, was made of ostrich feathers.
    The perfect feather of unusual length was chosen for the foundation, and
    on it was grafted the fibres or flues of other feathers as a filling. The
    feather, when finished, is extremely wide and &quot;willowy&quot; as extra
    flues are tied to the ends of the original flues&#8212;sometimes as many
    as three being joined together.</p>
  <p>The Amazon plume is also used when Fashion has a whim. It is a long plume,
    so curled that the entire stem is hidden. The lobster
    plume is so called because the stem is so bent that it encircles the hat,
    and the underside of the feather shows on the outside.</p>
  <p>Some of the newer fashions in millinery decree that just the tips of the
    ostrich feather shall be worn&#8212;two or three of the graceful tips grouped
    into one charming trimming. The tips may be all of one color, or the colors
    may be different but of harmonizing shades.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illus/11-03-fig3.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,518);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/11-03-fig3-t.jpg" alt="Figure 3. Ostrich feather" width="166" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Ostrich feathers are sometimes treated with a coating of glycerine to make
    what is known as the glycerine feather. (Fig. 3.) Ostrich feathers are also
    treated with acid baths which burn away the fibers on the flues and make
    the feathers lighter and airier. This type of feather is called the spumed
    feather, and sometimes the burnt ostrich.</p>
  <h3><a name="applying" id="applying"></a>Applying Ostrich Feathers</h3>
  <p>The ostrich feather is most appropriate for the mature woman, but only when
    the tips are used, the trimming is an ideal one for the young woman. Even
    children's hats are sometimes trimmed with ostrich tips. Burnt ostrich is
    a youthful trimming, and is becoming to youth and age alike.</p>
  <p>To apply ostrich plumes and tips gracefully is in itself an achievement.
    We strongly advise that you study an assortment of ostrich plumes in various
    lengths and modes of curl and notice how they are arranged on various types
    of shapes. In this way you will not only make yourself familiar with the
    many types of ostrich plumes, but also with the manner of application which
    is most suitable to the type of shape used.</p>
  <p>Feathers should not be applied to a hat so that they sprawl in every way
    and whirl out of place at the least breath of wind. The feather should follow
    as closely as possible the lines of the hat, or should at least be in harmony
    with the lines. If the feather is at an angle, it should be at such an angle
    that adds to the beauty of the effect rather than creates simply a bizarre
    appearance and so detracts from the beauty. And if the feather does not follow
    the line of the hat it should most certainly follow the line of the face
    and figure of the wearer. Otherwise there will be no harmony&#8212;and without
    harmony there can be no beauty.</p>
  <p>If you wish to apply the feather in such a way that is cannot retain its
    pose without some support, you may have recourse to wires. You may sew a
    fine, firm wire to the underside of the quill, but be sure that the wire
    matches the plume as closely as possible. Cut the wire before reaching the
    tip or head so that this part may fall softly and loosely. Secure the wire
    firmly to the stem at the root of the feather by twisting tie wire around
    it. The wire should be secured to the quill with small buttonhole stitches.</p>
  <p>When wired in the manner above explained, the ostrich plume can be curved
    in any way desired&#8212;and it will keep its curve despite the angry attempts
    of the wind to blow it out of place.</p>
  <p>Always pin a feather in place, before stitching it permanently. Experiment
    until you acquire the best and most becoming angle, then &quot;anchor&quot; by
    taking stitches over the quill.</p>
  <h3><a name="wings" id="wings"></a>Wings and Trimmings That are Made of Feathers</h3>
  <p>There are two types of wings&#8212;the natural and the manufactured. The
    made or manufactured wings are of many styles and shapes and change with
    every season. They are made of feathers glued on foundations. They are very
    much more fragile than the natural wings. For this reason they are usually
    wired on the under side (if they are used flat) with fine, strong wire in
    such a way that the wire does not show yet is around almost the entire outline
    of the feather to protect it.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illus/11-04-fig4.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,438);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/11-04-fig4-t.jpg" alt="Figure 4. Wings" width="139" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Natural wings, and other ornaments made of feathers are made from the feathers
    of the barnyard fowls. There was a time when thoughtless women wore the beautiful
    plumage of certain wild birds which have become almost extinct because of
    the ruthless destruction on the part of hunters in quest of the valuable
    feathers. Laws have been enacted which prevent the killing of our beautiful
    wild birds for their plumage, and women must now content themselves with
    the feathers of birds that are killed for the purpose of food, such as the
    goose, the guinea fowl, the turkey, duck and chicken. Of the wild fowl, the
    feathers of the pheasant, prairie hen and a few others may be used.</p>
  <p>Among the wild birds that have become almost extinct is the egret&#8212;a
    beautiful bird with a pathetic history. At one time the egret was plentiful.
    In South America the woods were made beautiful by these graceful birds with
    their long exquisite feathers. But hunters soon realized the value of the
    egret's feathers as a hat ornament, and there began a ruthless destruction
    of the birds which is a disgrace to the history of the American hat industry.
    Women were ecstatic when they saw the slender, graceful feathers and, of
    course, no woman was happy until she had one. Hunters were kept busy killing
    the gentle birds, until their extinction was threatened.</p>
  <p>You see, it is only at nesting time that the egret's feathers are in their
    prime&#8212;and therefore suitable for millinery purposes. It was at nesting
    time, therefore that the hunter killed the mother egret who dared not fly
    to safety and leave her young to the mercies of the enemy. That is what makes
    the story so pathetic. Not only did the hunter kill the egret, but he deprived
    the newly-born birds of their mother and they, too, died of slow starvation.</p>
  <p>Slowly the egret neared extinction, until finally a few far-sighted
    persons realized what was happening and took the matter into their own hands.
    They
    had laws enacted which made the killing of the egret and the selling of the
    feathers, illegal, and no one may kill the bird today without fitting punishment.</p>
  <p>The feathers of the barnyard fowl, therefore, are used where the egret was
    used before. These feathers are treated to make them sanitary, then dyed,
    and finally manufactured into such wings and ornaments as Fashion decrees
    for the season. Net is used as a foundation for the wings and ornaments,
    it is
    wired and made into any shape desired. The feathers are then glued in place.
    It is a wise plan to covet feather wings and ornaments with maline when they
    are new, to prevent the feathers from becoming loosened.</p>
  <p>Breasts of birds are used extensively on hats for elderly women. These too
    may be natural, or manufactured. In using made breasts, one should take great
    care in sewing as the thread may break off the tiny feathers and so spoil
    the breast. It is best to cover the breast with maline before attaching to
    the hat.</p>
  <p>One of Fashions latest whims are flowers made entirely of feathers. Hand-bags
    and slippers are even being made now of tiny carefully matched feathers!
    Feather flowers may be purchased ready-made, or made at home.</p>
  <h3><a name="quills" id="quills"></a>Quills</h3>
  <p class="clear">A quill <em><a href="illus/11-06-fig6.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,308);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/11-06-fig6-t.jpg" alt="Figure 6. Quills" width="96" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>is<em><a href="illus/11-05-fig5.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,319);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/11-05-fig5-t.jpg" alt="Figure 5. Quill" width="100" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em> a single feather taken from the end of the wing or tail of the
    bird. There is an unlimited variety of quills which can be used for millinery
    purposes, but the supply in America is limited as certain kinds of quills
    are barred. The United States produces very few kinds, but those that are
    available are attractively colored and entirely satisfactory. There is enough
    of a variety to satisfy the most eager milliner.</p>
  <p>In handling quills, always sew the end of the quill firmly. Great care should
    be taken not to split the fine, delicate flue as this will ruin the quill.
    This type of trimming offers excellent opportunities for color contrast;
    one may use a red quill on a black hat, or a black quill on 
    a red hat&#8212;always remembering that harmony must be observed even in
    contrast.</p>
  <p>In millinery, peacock feathers are used as a quill. The supply of these
    fine, delicately-colored quills is limited and those that are obtainable
    are as expensive as they are pretty. Pheasant feathers are sometimes used
    as quills, too, and they are often extremely attractive. They are very much
    less expensive than peacock feathers.</p>
  <p>Young people can wear quills to the best advantage, although they are not
    inappropriate for the mature woman. The angle at which the quill is applied
    is very important if one wishes the right degree of smartness and the student
    is advised to practice and experiment until she can apply a feather or quill
    deftly, smartly and attractively.</p>
  <p>One thing more before leaving the subject of feathers: Ostrich feathers,
    arid 
    certain other kinds, are very apt to lose their curl if exposed to dampness.
    To restore the curl, obtain a regular feather curling knife with a curved
    blade and handy wooden handle. First shake the feather for a few minutes
    over heat, or allow it to hang for a few moments in intense sunlight (but
    not too long as the color will fade) and then proceed in this manner. Beginning
    at the top, take three or four of the fronds between the edge of the knife
    and the thumb and draw out slowly. Let the pressure be light from the quill
    to near the end, then press more firmly. Thus the ends will be turned under
    and the curl restored.</p>
  <h3><a name="ribbon" id="ribbon"></a>Ribbon Trimmings</h3>
  <p>Many women are naturally deft in the handling of ribbons and can quickly
    transform a piece of ribbon into a charming, artistic bow or loop. But that
    is no reason why everyone cannot learn to do this. It is just as easy to
    learn how to handle ribbon and ribbon trimmings as it is to learn how to
    sew braid, or cut a frame.</p>
  <p>In ribbon work, your slogan should be &quot;practice makes perfect&quot;.
    This is very, very true. The more you practice&#8212;even if it is just with
    scraps of ribbon&#8212;the more deft and quick you will become. Each year
    new ribbon trimmings are in vogue, and the knowledge of how to use ribbons
    and how to make ribbon trimmings will prove very valuable to you.</p>
  <p>First in importance, of course, is being able to select ribbons wisely.
    You must be able to judge quality; to know whether a certain kind of ribbon
    is appropriate for the hat you have in mind. Price does not always denote
    quality, and you should be able to judge quality regardless of price. This
    is something that comes from practice and experience, but here are some suggestions
    that may help you.</p>
  <p>Ribbons are woven as silks are. When the ribbon is of good quality, there
    will be a cord at the edge, while poor quality ribbon will have a flat finish.
    This cord gives strength and is a sure indication of quality.</p>
  <p>Weighted ribbon does not wear well, and the milliner should be able to recognize
    weighted materials at once&#8212;ribbons included. Weighted ribbons will
    crack after being worn a short while. Satin should always be of the best
    grade obtainable, as the poorer grades of satin roughen easily and lose their
    sheen.</p>
  <p>Velvet ribbons come in many colors, including black and white. Not so many
    years ago, it was difficult to buy velvet ribbons in the beautiful shades
    that are now available. Always be sure that the back of the ribbon is satin-finished
    if it is to be used in loops or bows. But if the velvet ribbon is to be used
    flat against the hat, it may be cotton-finished in the back.</p>
  <p>Milliners are today offered splendid trimming possibilities in the new brocade
    ribbons. These ribbons come in very beautiful colors and handsome effects,
    and are as effective on hats as they are on dresses.</p>
  <h3><a name="weaves" id="weaves"></a>Weaves and Designs in Ribbons</h3>
  <p>Ribbons are woven in stripes, plaids or other designs, and sometimes they
    are printed. The better grades of ribbon are warp printed. This is done after
    the warp has been put in the loom, and is done on the warp only. After the
    ribbon is woven, these figures show up in hazy outline and beautiful soft
    tones.</p>
  <p>In cheaper ribbons the designs are on the surface and are more harsh and
    prominent. Designs are woven in ribbons just as they are in silks, a great
    many ribbons being of the attractive Jacquard design.</p>
  <p>Some seasons find the changeable silk ribbon enjoying wide popularity. This
    is a ribbon woven with a warp of one or two colors and a weft or filling
    of another color. This produces a most charming changeable effect.</p>
  <p>Ribbon is sometimes made with a picot edge and is popular both for millinery
    work and dressmaking purposes. It is finished at the edges with a heavy cord
    forming a picot, or looped effect. Gauze ribbon is sometimes used by florists;
    it is made of spun silk and often in gold or silver metal. The metal ribbons
    are used for evening hats and to trim evening gowns.</p>
  <h3><a name="trimming" id="trimming"></a>Ribbon as a Trimming</h3>
  <p>The study of ribbon-trimming in millinery is an extensive one&#8212; but
    it is as fascinating as it is extensive. Each season there are grosgrain
    ribbons, ribbons of taffeta, faille, satin and velvet, ribbons in all different
    patterns and designs. Only by following the season's styles and by studying
    the various types and qualities of ribbons, can one hope to become proficient
    in the selecting of good quality, dependable, appropriate ribbons for the
    purpose of trimming hats.</p>
  <p>In millinery, ribbons are used for making bows, plaitings, shirrings, tailored
    ornaments, bands, draperies, streamers and flowers. Sometimes a complete
    hat is made of ribbon. And sometimes wide ribbons are used for hat crowns.
    Narrow grosgrain ribbon can be used as a braid and made into an entire hat.</p>
  <p>Ribbons can be made up into beautiful flowers and floral designs. This subject
    is covered in detail later in the course. You are taught how to make a variety
    of handsome flowers including roses, ribbon violets, petals, leaves and many
    other important types of millinery trimming. You are taught exactly how to
    make the flowers so that you may duplicate some smart little Parisian model
    that tempts you in some shop window!</p>
  <p>By observing well the kinds of ribbons used on various kinds of hats, the
    student will learn a great deal that will be helpful to her. She will find
    out, among other things, that satin makes the most appropriate ribbon for
    trimming children's hats, that grosgrain ribbon is ideal for trimming tailored
    hats, and that velvet ribbon is becoming to the elderly woman. Each season
    brings new uses for old ribbons, and new ribbons for old uses&#8212;but it
    is only through observation and experience that these things can be learned.</p>
  <h3><a name="flowers" id="flowers"></a>Flowers, Fruits and Foliage</h3>
  <p>Millinery would not be millinery without the colorful flowers that greet
    each new Spring. It seems that the milliner's fancy lightly turns to thoughts
    of gay flowers in the Spring-time.</p>
  <p>Many striking effects can be obtained by the use of floral trimmings. A
    black hat with a yellow rose tucked just beneath the brim; a white hat with
    black daisies for sports occasions; a big, floppy-brim leghorn with violets
    around the crown&#8212;these are only a few of the countless attractive effects
    one can obtain.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illus/11-07-fig7.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,551);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/11-07-fig7-t.jpg" alt="Figure 7. Silk poppy" width="177" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>There are many kinds of flowers used in millinery. Silk flowers are the
    most extensively used. (Fig. 7.) They are treated in a certain way which
    makes the petals glossy on the upper side and dull on the under side. Silk
    roses are most charming and are appropriate at almost all times. They are
    flattering, too, and may be worn alike by young and old.</p>
  <p>Velvet flowers are not as appropriate for summer, nor are flowers of chenille
    or felt. However, these flowers are ideal in
    the winter, especially when used on hats for the elderly woman.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illus/11-08-fig8.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,483);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/11-08-fig8-t.jpg" alt="Figure 8. Cotton flowers" width="154" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Cotton or linen flowers are used a great deal on summer hats. They are inexpensive
    and are obtainable in countless colors and styles&#8212;tiny violets or forget-me-nots;
    big, lazy daisies that spread out their petals in frank contentment; huge
    roses, conscious of their beauty. Any flower you wish, practically, may be
    obtained at any milliner's shop, or can be made right at home.</p>
  <p>There are yarn flowers, too&#8212;roses and violets that grow right out
    of yarn! You'll love to make them, and they afford a novel and pleasing trimming
    touch to the sports hat for Spring or Fall. The method of making
    yarn flowers will be taught later, too.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illus/11-09-fig9.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,328);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/11-09-fig9-t.jpg" alt="Figure 9. Foliage" width="103" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>We could go on endlessly, telling you about the many attractive ornaments
    you can buy and make for trimming purposes in millinery. But it is a much
    wiser plan to haunt millinery supply shops and see for yourself the wealth
    of trimming suggestions you have to select from. Berries in endless variety;
    foliage in softly shaded effects; fruits that tempt you and ornaments of
    jet that you simply must take up and fondle. A trimming for every conceivable
    type of hat, and trimmings that make you want to sit right down and make
    a hat at once so that you can use them! You'll have no trouble whatever,
    in selecting the right trimming for the right hat once you train yourself
    to observe what others are wearing and showing.</p>
  <p class="clear">In<em><a href="illus/11-10-fig10.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,757);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/11-10-fig10-t.jpg" alt="Figure 10. A bunch of flowers" width="246" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>    selecting <em><a href="illus/11-11-fig11.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',381,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/11-11-fig11-t.jpg" alt="Figure 11. Fruit" width="220" height="99" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>flowers, always be sure that the foliage harmonizes. If there are
    two kinds of flowers,
    don't use the wrong foliage with the wrong flower. Try to keep the stems
    as short and as inconspicuous as possible, and always remember that in every
    hat there's a just-right place for the trimming. Make it a practice to find
    the just-right place before you are satisfied.  
    In millinery, a &quot;bunch&quot; of fruit or flowers is used to denote several
    sprays attached in one group&#8212;or bunch, just as the word implies.
    A &quot;spray&quot; is just one natural bunch as it would appear on the tree
    or bush where it grew if it were natural&#8212;that which appears on
    one twig. A &quot;wreath&quot; is made up of single
    pieces of fruit or single sprays of flowers tied together in circular form
    and used ordinarily to encircle a crown. A &quot;cluster&quot; usually denotes
    a number of flowers clipped quite close to the stem and arranged in a sort
    of bouquet. A spray is the natural form; a cluster is an artificial form.
    The good milliner can always distinguish between these four terms and knows
    at once the difference between a bunch, spray, cluster and wreath. Fig.
    11 shows a bunch of fruit, while Fig. 10 shows a bunch of flowers artistically
arranged.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><a name="misc" id="misc"></a>Miscellaneous Trimmings</h3>
  <p>Of course, feathers, flowers and ribbons are not the only ready-made trimmings
    which may be used on hats. There are many others which I am going to tell
    you about. No doubt you can think of some I have not mentioned. The subject
    of trimming is an almost inexhaustible one, so I am just giving suggestions,
    which may bring others to your mind. Many trimmings go out of style and stay
    for years, and then the first thing one knows they are back again and are
    the center of attraction. It is for this reason that in order to be an expert
    milliner it is necessary to follow the fashions, by reading the latest millinery
    magazines, going through the shops if possible and studying the different
    models and in fact using every possible method of gaining the very latest
    information.</p>
  <h3><a name="hatpins" id="hatpins"></a>Hat Pins</h3>
  <p>It is possible to purchase very pretty short hat pins which may be pinned
    on the hat as an ornament. Since the tight-fitting hat has come into vogue
    the hat pin has lost its usefulness. However, it is still used to some extent
    for decoration. As to just the right angle to place this pin, this must be
    left entirely up to the individual. It depends on the style of the hat and
    the angle at which it is worn. These pins may be of colored glass to imitate
    precious stones, or are sometimes made of raffia, leather, calfskin or whatever
    happens to be the season's favorite novelty.</p>
  <h3><a name="buckles" id="buckles"></a>Buckles</h3>
  <p>Buckles made of leather, silver, cut steel, rhinestones, jet or a celluloid
    composition are sometimes used. The ribbon buckle is often popular and may
    be made by covering heavy cardboard with the desired color and width of ribbon.
    These buckles may be large or small according to the taste of the wearer
    or the whims of Fashion. These, like all other forms of trimmings, are in
    style and out, and one has but to be alert to catch the passing fancy.</p>
  <h3><a name="pins" id="pins"></a>Pins</h3>
  <p>You have all seen the pretty rhinestone pins which add so much to the right
    type of hat. Who doesn't admire a stunning
    black satin hat with a well-chosen pin placed at just the becoming angle?
    The hat needs no other decoration. Colored pins are sometimes worn and are
    very effective.</p>
  <p>Before leaving this lesson on trimmings, we wish to impress you with the
    importance of choosing the right trimming at the right time. Exercise great
    care and discrimination in selecting a type of trimming, because you will
    not achieve a perfect work of millinery art if you use a trimming that is
    entirely inappropriate. Don't choose a tailored trimming for an elaborate
    hat; or an elaborate trimming for a tailored hat. It is as important to have
    harmony between type of hat and type of trimming as it is to have harmony
    in color and style.</p>

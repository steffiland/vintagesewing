  <h3>    <a name="fewwords" id="fewwords"></a>A Few Words of Interest Before
  you Begin</h3>
  <p> You are about to begin the study of hat-making&#8212;a study as fascinating
    as it is useful. To the woman or young girl who takes up this study seriously,
    a wealth of valuable information is offered&#8212;information that will not
    only enable her to make beautiful hats for herself and for her friends, but
    that will actually lay the foundation of an accomplishment, a profession,
    that will enable her to earn a profitable livelihood should it ever become
  necessary.</p>
  <p>There are a great many people who have the mistaken idea that the ability
    to make pretty hats is inherent. To them, a designer of hats is born, not
    made. The colorful hat with its artistic folds and curves, its delicate finish
    and smart trimmings, seems to be a mystery. Yet it is very well known by
    those who understand the art of millinery design that the girl or woman who
    studies the technicalities of hat-making is able to make a much prettier
    and much more becoming hat than the &quot;born milliner&quot; who knows nothing
    of such things as harmony, line, color and construction.</p>
  <p>For a long time&#8212;too long, in fact&#8212;millinery has been confined
    to what is known as &quot;the trade.&quot; The woman in the home was compelled
    to pay a high price for the French creation that, if she but knew how, could
    be duplicated almost exactly at a fraction of the cost. Hat-making was kept
    a mystery&#8212;just as dressmaking was kept a mystery for a long time. But
    just as the secrets of fashionable dressmaking have been revealed to the
    woman in the home, so now are the secrets of millinery revealed to the woman
    who wishes to make her own pretty hats.</p>
  <p>In these pages, millinery is taught as a science. From all the methods used,
    have been gathered the most practical, simple and easy-to-follow methods.
    But everything has been brought down to its simplest, most complete and compact
    form. Instead of burdening the student with a great deal of unessential and
    hindering detail, the making of hats has been reduced to a series of steps
    which, if followed carefully, will make the study of millinery fascinating
    and interesting.</p>
  <p>The student must remember, however, that the mere reading of the text will
    not suffice. All work must be practiced until it 
    is perfect. All methods must be practiced until the student is deft and quick.
    To insure proficiency and accuracy the student must practice constantly,
    and master each detail before proceeding to the next step.</p>
  <h3><a name="twobranches" id="twobranches"></a>The Two Branches of Millinery</h3>
  <p>There are two definite branches of millinery that the student must master
    before she can consider herself an actual milliner. The first of these is
    the construction, or the composition. This consists of the technical process
    of hat construction&#8212;from the making of the wire frame or buckram frame
    to the final trimming touches. This phase of the study of millinery is particularly
    important, for upon it depends the symmetry and lines of the hat, the charm
    and attractiveness of it. It also represents the major part of millinery,
    for it entails the studying of various methods&#8212;of stitches, linings,
    fittings, trimmings, etc. The first lessons of the text are devoted almost
    entirely to the construction branch of millinery.</p>
  <p>The other branch of millinery is design. Design is the art of the work.
    Design teaches you how to combine colors harmoniously, how to achieve the
    just-right angle or curve, how to carry out a certain costume idea in the
    hat. To evolve the design requires a certain amount of natural ability, although
    constant practice and a sincere effort will make it possible for anyone to
    create hat styles that are distinctive and beautiful. Millinery design is
    taught later in the text&#8212;for, after all, you must know how to make
    a hat, how to construct the frame, apply the straw or material, add the trimmings
    and finishing touches, before you are able to carry out any ideas you may
    design.</p>
  <p>Throughout the first lessons you will find much to help you with your final
    work on design. Apply yourself earnestly to your lessons. Master each one
    thoroughly before proceeding to the next. Millinery is an important and dignified
    profession&#8212;one any woman may be proud of&#8212;and the more seriously
    you apply yourself to your work, the more adept and clever you will be in
    the creating and constructing of beautiful hats.</p>
  <p>One thing more: Millinery is extremely wide in its scope. Indeed, there
    are some millinery experts who insist there is no end to the teaching of
    the art of hat-making! In this respect it is not unlike any other branch
    of education. However, although each season brings new hat modes, new types
    of trimmings and new materials, once you have mastered the two branches,
    hat construction and hat design, you will be able to follow the millinery
    fashions without the least trouble. These new methods are really nothing
    more or less than new adaptations of old methods&#8212;and once you have
    mastered the technical methods taught in this course, you will be able to
    carry out the style ideas of every season.</p>
  <h3><a name="origin" id="origin"></a>Origin of the Word &quot;Millinery&quot;</h3>
  <p>In the lessons we are going to endeavor to teach you, in as simple and understandable
    a method as possible, all there is to know about the art of millinery, so
    that by the time you have completed them all you will be an expert. As a
    student of millinery, you will undoubtedly want to know the origin of the
    word.</p>
  <p>Ever since the early ages, the city of Milan has been famous for its ribbons
    and silks. Isn't it but natural, then, that this city should play a large
    part in the development of hat-making? It was in Milan that a gentleman first
    conceived the idea of creating various different types of hats for various
    different types of women. At first, in those early ages, all women wore the
    same kind of headdress, which was really a miniature shawl. In Europe, the
    gentleman of Milan was spoken of as &quot;the Milaner.&quot; And from &quot;Milaner&quot; (a
    gentleman of Milan) we have our own word &quot;millinery.&quot;</p>
  <p>Words have their origin in many strange ways, but <strong>millinery</strong> has quite an
    exalted origin in <strong>Milaner</strong>&#8212;for it does justice to that beautiful old
    town where millinery in its true sense first had its inception.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><a name="equipment" id="equipment"></a><a href="illus/01-01-equip.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',270,460);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/01-01-equip-t.jpg" alt="Hat, scissors, spools of thread, and book on a table" width="140" height="80" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>Equipment for Millinery</h3>
  <p>Let us now consider the necessary equipment you will require as a student
    of millinery. Just as a good workman needs correct tools, just as the dressmaker
    needs her shears, her threads, her dress form&#8212;so will you, as a milliner,
    need certain things with which to do your work.</p>
  <p>If you expect to take up your work seriously and to make hats for yourself
    almost from the start, you should have one room which you can devote entirely
    to your work. Perhaps you already have a sewing room. Clear away one part
    of it, and prepare it for your millinery work. You will need a comfortable
    chair, low enough to permit the feet to rest squarely on the floor. The table
    should be fitted with a small piece of hardwood, attached to the table in
    the form of a rack. Into this wood have a half-dozen wire nails (without
    heads) driven, and use them to hold spools of cotton and silk.</p>
  <p>Following are the articles the millinery beginner will need. This equipment
    is gauged from the lessons of this text. If you expect to do work not required
    by the lessons, you may need other things&#8212;such as colored thread, ribbon,
    etc.</p>
  <p><em>Needles</em>: A long needle, known as the milliner's needle, is used a great
    deal in hat-making. It comes in sizes from 1 to 10, varying according to
    the fineness of the needle. Needle No. 1 is the coarsest; needle No. 10 is
    the finest. Darning needles are also used in millinery work. They are used
    when doing embroidery work with ribbon, chenille or heavy yarns that are
    too large to be used in the ordinary embroidery needle. Another type of needle
    frequently used in millinery is the surgeon's curved needle. It is used to
    attach flowers or leaves to hats that are entirely covered with flowers or
    leaves. The needle and thread are kept on the under side of the hat, the
    point of the needle being pushed through the foundation from the wrong side
    and passing over the stem of the leaf or flower. The needle is then pushed
    gently and the point will pass through the foundation to the wrong side.
    When the thread is drawn tight, it will hold the flower in place. Remember
    this method of sewing on flowers and leaves&#8212;it will save you much annoyance
    and trouble, and will do the work very much prettier and neater than the
    ordinary needle-and-thread method.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illus/01-02-emery.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',392,364);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/01-02-emery-t.jpg" alt="Strawberry-shaped emery bag" width="140" height="151" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>Emery Bag</em>: You will find an emery bag very important in millinery work.
    Moisture from the hands, glue used on trimmings and buckram shapes will cling
    to the needle and cause it to become rough. The emery bag, used frequently,
    will keep your needles in good condition for sewing.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illus/01-03-pins.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',354,480);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/01-03-pins-t.jpg" alt="Box and paper of pins" width="140" height="102" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>Pins</em>: You will find that a flat tray for pins is very much more convenient
    than one of the old-fashioned cushions. Always keep plenty of pins on hand
    as they are very essential in millinery. Purchase the usual dressmakers'
    pins of medium size. They may be had in one-fourth, one-half and one lb.
    boxes at an economical price.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illus/01-04-scissors.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',486,450);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/01-04-scissors-t.jpg" alt="Scissors" width="140" height="151" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>Scissors</em>: For millinery use scissors seven and one half to eight inches
    long, as they are best for all general work. Shears shorter than this are
    too small, and if larger they are unhandy for doing the work required on
    the inside of the hat.</p>
  <p><em>Thread</em>: The usual milliner's thread has a softer finish than dressmaker's
    thread, and comes on a spool of slightly different shape than the ordinary
    thread. Because it has a softer twist and finish it can be drawn through
    materials much more easily than the ordinary thread.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illus/01-05-thimble.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',491,465);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/01-05-thimble-t.jpg" alt="Thimble" width="140" height="148" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>Thimble</em>: A thimble is an absolute essential in hat-making. The materials
    ordinarily used make it practically impossible to sew without one. A silver
    thimble is the best.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illus/01-06-pliers.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',313,472);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/01-06-pliers-t.jpg" alt="Pliers" width="140" height="91" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>Pliers</em>: For cutting wire, use a pair of long nose pliers with the wire-cutting
    edge at the side. You will find that short-nosed pliers are not very practical
    for millinery work. A very good pair of pliers is needed, as it has a great
    many uses and a poor pair will not serve the purpose well.</p>
  <p>In addition to the equipment already mentioned, you will need a tape measure
    and a yard stick. The yard stick is used in measuring materials. The tape
    measure is very convenient in measuring crowns, brims, etc.</p>
  <p>Good light is very essential in millinery work. If you cannot have daylight&#8212;plenty
    of it&#8212; see that you have the best artificial light possible. The best
    position for sewing is with the back against the light, and with the light
    falling over the left shoulder.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><a name="usemachine" id="usemachine"></a><em><a href="illus/01-07-machine.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',448,448);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/01-07-machine-t.jpg" alt="Treadle sewing machine" width="140" height="140" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Use of the Sewing Machine in Millinery</h3>
  <p>If you have a sewing machine, you will find it a valuable time and money
    saver in your millinery work. This is especially true if you have the sewing-machine
    attachments and use them. The binder, for instance, will enable you to bind
    edges on ribbon trimmings. The ruffler will enable you to ruffle a crown
    or brim quickly and easily; and you will be able to make fine plaits or tucks
    without any trouble whatever.</p>
  <p>The most practical use of the sewing machine is in stitching materials together.
    This saves a great deal of time, if large pieces of material are attached.</p>
  <p>The attachments on the sewing machine are wonderful time-savers. For hemming
    fine materials, there can be nothing to compare with the hemmer attachments.
    For attaching lace edges, the edgestitcher is ideal, as it does the work
    more neatly than it could possibly be done by hand&#8212;and in very much
    less time.</p>
  <p> Of course, you must learn how to use the attachments before they can be
    of any real value to you. Your sewing machine dealer will supply you with
    all
      attachments to fit your machine, if you have misplaced those that came
    with it originally, and will demonstrate to you how they are used. Almost
    all
      sewing machine companies issue booklets telling how the attachments are
    used.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><a name="binder" id="binder"></a><em><a href="illus/01-08-binder.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',544,322);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/01-08-binder-t.jpg" alt="The binding foot attachment" width="115" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Use of the Binder</h3>
  <p>1. Remove the presser foot from the machine. The presser foot is the foot
    used for ordinary machine sewing. Now, following the directions in the instruction
    book that you received when you purchased your sewing machine, attach the
    binder.</p>
  <p>2. Cut your binding on the true bias. If you use small pieces it may be
    necessary to join them together. Binding may be from one-eighth to three-quarters
    of an inch in width, according to requirements.</p>
  <p>3. Fold the bias strip in the centre lengthwise, and cut a point at the
    end to permit it being passed easily through the binder.</p>
  <p>4. On the binder you will find a scroll. It is through this that the binding
    must pass until the point comes through the end under the foot. As the binding
    passes through the scroll you will notice that the edges are turned in automatically&#8212;and
    with an exact mathematical precision which could never be accomplished by
    hand.</p>
  <p>5. The edge upon which the binding is to be applied should be held in the
    scroll of the binder. This will bring the edge of the material to be bound
    between the two turned edges of the binding. Proceed to pass it through the
    binder until it emerges beneath the needle when the stitching is begun. The
    needle passes through the turned edges of the binding and through the material
    to be bound, holding all three edges together.</p>
  <p>6. Begin to stitch, being sure that the stitching comes close to the edge
    and that the binding is not allowed to stretch. Be careful to keep the material
    to be bound well within the binder, otherwise the binding will not be attached
    firmly to the edge.</p>
  <p>7. Continue to feed the material into the binder as quickly as the machine
    feeds. Do not make the mistake of holding back either material or binding,
    but allow the material to enter the binder with the same speed as the machine,
    merely guiding it.</p>
  <p class="clear">8. <em><a href="illus/01-09-binding.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',436,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/01-09-binding-t.jpg" alt="Using the binding foot to attach binding to the edge" width="220" height="114" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>When turning a curved edge, urge the material gently around with the
    fingers of the left hand, being sure that the edge of the material to be
    bound and the bias binding are all following correctly.</p>
  <p>Practice until you master the correct method of binding edges. For instance
    use the binder to bind the edges on sport hats, and you will find that the
    stitches add to the beauty of the hat.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><a name="gauge" id="gauge"></a><em><a href="illus/01-10-gauge.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',198,534);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/01-10-gauge-t.jpg" alt="The cutting gauge" width="220" height="76" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>The Cutting Gauge and its Use</h3>
  <p>The cutting gauge is a tiny steel attachment that is used on the end of
    your scissors. It is used to gauge the width of bias materials cut for various
    purposes. There are three letters on this gauge&#8212;F, B, and C. There
    is also a slide that can be moved back and forth and set at any of these
    marks. When it is set at F the strip cut is just wide enough for a facing.
    When it is set at B it is the proper width to be used in your binder. When
    it is set at C it is just right for cording. Let us see how the gauge is
    used in cutting bias folds.</p>
  <p class="clear">1. Fold the <em><a href="illus/01-12-gauge-3.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,377);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/01-12-gauge-3-t.jpg" alt="Using the cutting gauge on the scissors to cut a strip of fabric" width="119" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>material <em><a href="illus/01-11-gauge-2.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,382);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/01-11-gauge-2-t.jpg" alt="Attaching the cutting gauge to the scissors" width="121" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>on the bias in the following manner. If the material
    is one yard long and one yard wide, place the selvedge exactly along the
    cut edge of the material. This will make a fold from one corner diagonally
    to the other, and if folded in this manner and cut on the fold you will have
    a true bias. The bias strips are cut from these edges along the fold. Always
    be careful to cut on a true bias.</p>
  <p>2. Place the cutting gauge on the point of the scissors, adjusting it firmly
    so that it does not fall off while you are cutting the bias strip.</p>
  <p>3. Insert the edge of the material in the gauge, bringing the material between
    the blades of the scissors. Proceed to cut the bias strips.</p>
  <p> Illustrated on the next page are the correct and incorrect methods of joining
      bias strips after cutting them. It is important that you do not make the
    mistake of joining the strips in the wrong way, as it will spoil the rest
    of your work. When you have bias
    strips all ready to join, join the selvedges to the selvedges and the crosswise
    edges to the crosswise edges. Be sure that the seams are made deep enough
    to be pressed open flat for use in the binder. Bear in mind always that bias
    material stretches and that when a bias strip of material is stretched it
    becomes much narrower and the binder will not work properly.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illus/01-13-bias.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',386,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/01-13-bias-t.jpg" alt="Wrong and right way to join strips to make continuous bias strip" width="220" height="101" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>In millinery, you will have much occasion to use bias materials and bias
    bindings. Whatever you have learned in this lesson on equipment will prove
    of value later in your more advanced lessons.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><a name="ruffler" id="ruffler"></a>    The Use of the Ruffler</h3>
  <p><em><a href="illus/01-14-ruffler.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,646);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/01-14-ruffler-t.jpg" alt="Ruffler" width="140" height="134" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Your ruffler attachment offers you numerous means of applying new, distinctive
    trimming touches to the things-to-wear you make at home. It is one of the
    most valuable attachments in your box, and reflects a great deal of credit
    upon the inventors of these remarkable time-and-money saving bits of steel.</p>
  <p>The method of using the ruffler attachment varies with different machines.
    Study the instruction book that came with your machine for the correct method.
    Then, too, there is the shirring plate, which when adjusted with the ruffler
    enables you to make quickly and easily many delightful trimmings of shirring
    and lace.</p>
  <p>With your ruffler you will be able to make trimmings that would be very
    difficult, perhaps impossible, to make by hand. And they will be firm, and
    even&#8212;as no hand sewing could be.</p>
  <p>Remember that the use of the attachments saves long tedious hours of hand
    work, and trimmings may be made that rival hand work for beauty. Use the
    ruffler and shirring plate to make shirrings for hat facings. The ruffler
    alone may be used when plaitings are needed as a trimming. Properly adjusted,
    your ruffler will plait lace, ribbon, silk or silk braid producing a softer,
    more artistic effect than is possible in any other way.</p>
  <p>Experiment with different materials, and you will be surprised at the pleasing
    effects it is possible to produce with the aid of your sewing machine and
    its attachments.</p>
  <p>Another attachment that will be found valuable in millinery is known as
    the quilter. Its most common use in this work is for quilting sport hats.</p>
  <h3><a name="quilter" id="quilter"></a>Use of the Quilter</h3>
  <p>1.	Attach your quilting attachment as directed in your book of instructions.</p>
  <p>2. Mark on the material the design you intend to make, using colored basting
    thread or tailor's chalk. The criss-cross pattern is the one most frequently
    used.</p>
  <p>3. Insert the material to be quilted beneath the attachment and stitch on
    the marked lines.</p>
  <p>4. To facilitate the work of the quilter, attach the underbraider foot to
    your sewing machine. You will find that the work is accomplished much more
    easily when this foot is attached.</p>
  <p>Do not attempt to quilt very thick materials by machine, as you are liable
    to break your needles, and injure the tension on your machine.</p>
  <h3><a name="underbraider" id="underbraider"></a>The Underbraider</h3>
  <p>When making braided hats, or for making braided designs, the underbraider
    is a wonderful timesaver.</p>
  <p>1. The book of instructions which came with your machine will tell you how
    to attach the underbraider.</p>
  <p>2. Thread your underbraider attachment by inserting the braid through the
    tube.</p>
  <p>3. Mark your design on the wrong side of the material, and insert the material
    under the foot wrong side up.</p>
  <p>4. Lower the presser foot to stitch, having the tension of the machine set
    for an ordinary length stitch.</p>
  <p>5. To turn a square corner, raise the presser bar and turn the cloth in
    the proper direction, lower the bar and proceed to sew. If the needle is
    allowed to pierce the braid while the turn is being made the material will
    not pucker.</p>
  <p>6. When the braiding is finished, draw the end of the braid through the
    work by punching a small hole in it, and fasten it with small back stitches.</p>
  <h3><a name="suggestions" id="suggestions"></a>Suggestions</h3>
  <p>When making hat shapes of buckram, the lap seams may be stitched down either
    through the center of the lap or at each edge. In millinery work, seams on
    such materials as silk, satin, chiffon, georgette crepe, etc., may be stitched
    by machine. But it is always better to stitch velvet and such materials by
    hand. Perhaps this information does not seem valuable to you at the moment,
    as you are just starting on the fascinating study of hat creating, but the
    technicalities must be mastered before hats can be made&#8212; and although
    you do not find this information of immediate value, remember it so that
    you can refer to it when it <strong>does</strong> become valuable, as it will.</p>
  <h3><a name="notebook" id="notebook"></a>The Notebook</h3>
  <p>The beginner in millinery will find a notebook very useful, indeed. In it
    she can jot down all the items of interest that are constantly presenting
    themselves in magazines and newspapers, and also ideas that occur to her
    in the matter of millinery design.</p>
  <p>If you begin a notebook of this kind now, you will find that it has become
    a very valuable possession by the time the course is completed. Items of
    interest that may not seem valuable now, may prove invaluable to you later.
    Start a notebook now&#8212;and see how valuable it becomes in a short time.</p>
  <h3><a name="important" id="important"></a>Important Note to Students</h3>
  <p>Just as a writer cannot create a masterpiece before he has mastered the
    language, so the milliner cannot hope to become deft and clever until she
    has first mastered the ordinary details of sewing, frame-making and frame-covering.
    These details open the door to successful millinery, just as words and phrases
    open the door to successful authorship.</p>
  <p>Realizing this, we have so compiled this simplified course that long before
    you have finished it you will know a great deal about the making of pretty
    hats. It is such fun to make frames and to cover them. You will study all
    about trimmings and how to make them. Towards the end of the course you are
    even going to learn how to renovate materials that are too good to throw
    away. Of course, you will study hat design and the types of hats best fitted
    to different people. You will be very interested in these millinery lessons,
    I am just sure&#8212;but not only that, you will learn quickly and easily
    to make your own hats at a great saving.</p>

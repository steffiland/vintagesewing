  <h3>    <a name="hints" id="hints"></a>Helpful Hints to Be Learned Before Making a Hat</h3>
  <p>There are a number of important details in millinery which are so necessary
    for you to know before you begin the making of hats that I have decided to
    write this lesson which will deal with these different points.</p>
  <p>It is our earnest aim to make this course in Fashionable Millinery as complete
    as possible, and we wish to incorporate into it every detail, no matter how
    small, that may be of value to you. These details are taken up separately
    and we would suggest that you first read through the pages and gain a thorough
    impression of what they contain. Then read each item over carefully, mastering
    every detail, whatever it chances to be, so thoroughly that you will have
    no difficulty in recalling it at a moment's notice when the occasion arises.</p>
  <h3><a name="truebias" id="truebias"></a>How to Cut True Bias Bands</h3>
  <p>Many milliners experience difficulty in cutting correct bias bands. I am
    sure you will have no trouble whatever if you follow these directions.</p>
  <p>To cut a true bias lay the material on the table lengthwise. Turn the selvage,
    that is, the warp of the material, back onto the material, even with the
    woof or cross thread. This selvage forms a right angle with the lengthwise
    selvage, and this fold or bias is called a true bias. In measuring the width
    of bias strips do not measure along the selvage or straight edge, but across
    bias at right angles to folded bias edge. Fold the material, pin it in place
    and cut.</p>
  <p>If bias strips of different widths are desired mark the lines for the bias
    bands on the wrong side of your material, using a ruler and chalk. Use a
    hard pencil for light materials, and chalk for dark materials.</p>
  <h3>Methods of Making Folds </h3>
  <h3><a name="flat" id="flat"></a>Flat Fold</h3>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illus/08-01-fig1.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',340,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/08-01-fig1-t.jpg" alt="Figure 1. Flat fold" width="220" height="87" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>In making this kind of a fold cut the material twice the width desired when
    finished. After this is accomplished, turn both edges over to the wrong side
    until they meet in the center. With the lacing stitch, which has been described,
    draw the edges together by placing the needle under material one-eighth of
    an inch from the edge and take stitches one-quarter inch apart. Draw the
    edges together, giving somewhat the effect of lacing a shoe with a string.
  See Fig. 1.</p>
  <h3><a name="milliners" id="milliners"></a>To Make Milliners' Fold</h3>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illus/08-02-fig2.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',320,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/08-02-fig2-t.jpg" alt="Figure 2. Milliners' fold" width="220" height="83" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>1. Cut the fold on a true bias, two and one&#8212;half times the width that
      the finished band is to be. Join if necessary, using the plain seam. All
      seams should be pressed flat.</p>
  <p>2. Turn one edge to the wrong side, making this turn the width the band
    is to be.</p>
  <p>3. Fold the other edge to cover this raw edge. If done correctly, this turn
    will be one-half the width that the finished fold is to be.</p>
  <p>4. Catch-stitch this edge to one thickness of the material, being extremely
    careful that no stitches show on the right side of the fold.</p>
  <p>5. If the material is liable to ravel the top edge may be turned under one-quarter
    inch and held in place by means of the slip stitch. Great care must be taken
    that it does not show through on the right side.</p>
  <p>This fold is often used for finishing the base of the crown after the crown
    has been attached to the brim. In sewing either the flat fold or milliners'
    fold to the base of the crown, pin one end in position and then stretch it
    around the crown. Pin the two pieces of the fold together and sew. The joinings
    may be finished with a small tailored bow or with trimmings. A bias fold
    is sometimes used to finish the brim.</p>
  <h3><a name="crinoline" id="crinoline"></a>Cutting Crinoline</h3>
  <p>As we have already learned, it is necessary to cover the wire edge of frames
    with crinoline cut in bias strips. If you only need a little of this material
    it may be cut according to methods already given for cutting bias materials.
    However, if hats are being made on a large scale, a great deal of crinoline
    will be used. In order to do this, cut a bias corner from the material. Fold
    back four inches of material on the opposite corner of the same end. This
    will make it come on the bias. Turn it several times until the full length
    is folded. Fold and flatten the entire length of the material. Place pins
    to hold in place. You will notice that the selvage will wind in a bias slant
    around the fold. With a sharp pair of scissors cut one-inch strips from the
    bias edge. When the desired amount of binding has been cut, wind it in flat
    rolls. Be sure to stretch it before applying to the edge, a brim or crown.</p>
  <h3><a name="calculating" id="calculating"></a>Calculating Materials</h3>
  <p>There is probably no question oftener asked by students of Millinery than &quot;How
    much material should I buy for my hat?&quot; Of course, when hats are made
    in wholesale millinery houses there is plenty of material and the question
    as to the amount needed for a single hat need not be calculated. However,
    when a person is making just one hat for herself this is an entirely different
    matter.</p>
  <p>After the frame is made, it is necessary to measure with a tape measure
    and decide the amount needed. Another method is to cut paper patterns and
    place these patterns on a strip of paper or material the width to be used
    and then measure the strip.</p>
  <p>In case you are planning on covering a plain brim, measure the underside
    at the point of the greatest diameter. It is considered best to allow about
    1 1/2 or 2 inches for making. If the brim is to be covered with the same
    material on upper and lower part, then it will take twice the width of the
    brim at the widest point. For instance, if the brim of a hat is 14 inches
    in diameter, it will take 16 inches of 18-inch wide velvet, for you see an
    allowance of 1 1/2 to 2 inches is made for making. If both the upper and
    lower part of the brim are covered with the same material two times 16 or
    32 inches of 18-inch wide velvet would be purchased for covering the brim.
    On the other hand, one-half yard of 36-inch velvet would be plenty.</p>
  <p>In estimating the material for crowns it is necessary to consider whether
    the crown is plain or draped. Of course, a crown made in one piece takes
    less material than other types. To estimate the material for a plain crown,
    measure from the base over the top to the base on the opposite side. For
    the average crown 1/2 yard of 18-inch material will be enough.</p>
  <p>Some hats are made with the upper part and under facing in one piece. In
    this case a wide bias strip of the material may be used. It is possible to
    fold it through the center and stretch it over the brim, or the material
    may be held full at the edge and the fullness at the headsize gathered or
    plaited. A way of varying this covering would be to cut a bias strip for
    both the upper and lower part. This will require a little more material but
    makes many effective edge finishings possible.</p>
  <p>If a hat is to have a shirred brim, measure the circumference of the brim
    and allow 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 times the circumference. This will be all that is
    needed for heavy materials as velvet, faille or duvetyne, but for thin material
    more must be allowed, depending on the amount of shirring desired.</p>
  <p>It is possible to buy velvet cut on the bias. This makes it very convenient
    and less expensive than buying the material and cutting it yourself. Below
    is a table which will help to determine the amount of material necessary
    for a hat if the material is cut on the bias.</p>
  <p>5 inches on the selvage of the bias&#8212;3 1 /2 inches through the
material. </p>
  <p> 8 inches on the selvage of the bias&#8212;5 3/4 inches through the
    material. </p>
  <p> 10 inches on the selvage of the bias&#8212;7 inches through the
    material. </p>
  <p> 12 inches on the selvage of the bias&#8212;8 1/2 inches through the
    material. </p>
  <p> 16 inches on the selvage of the bias&#8212;11 1/4 inches through the
    material. </p>
  <p> 20 inches on the selvage of the bias&#8212;14 1/2 inches through the material.</p>
  <p> 24 inches on the selvage of the bias&#8212;17 inches through the
    material.</p>
  <h3><a name="padding" id="padding"></a>Padding Buckram Frames</h3>
  <p>Often the wires used to stay the buckram frame do not leave a smooth surface
    over which to stretch thin materials. The frame is padded with sheet wadding.
    Cut the material to exactly meet the edge of the brim. It is sewed with the
    stab stitch and is used only on the side where the stay wires are sewed.
    The padding turns up into the headsize, just as the hat material does, when
    applied.</p>
  <h3><a name="split" id="split"></a>Split Work</h3>
  <p>A millinery term which you will encounter in your experience as a fashionable
    hat-maker is &quot;Split Work.&quot; It is a process used when making hats
    of folds.</p>
  <p>You have probably often admired hats in which velvet, maline or chiffon
    was folded gracefully and attractively&#8212;and you may have wondered how
    the charming effect was achieved.</p>
  <p>It's really quite a simple process, not much different from the sewing of
    braids. But it is an important process, and one that every milliner should
    be well acquainted with. The frame, which should be of buckram, must be padded
    when doing split work. The nap of the velvet or grain of the material should
    run in the correct direction, just as though plain covering was being applied.</p>
  <p>1. The material should be cut on the bias, the bias strips being two and
    one-half inches wide. Join these strips with selvage to selvage, and crosswise
    edge to crosswise edge.</p>
  <p>2. Now fold this bias fold lengthwise through the center. Baste in position.
    If you are using velvet, you must do this basting with silk thread, as cotton
    thread will leave a mark.</p>
  <p>3. Bind the edge of the hat with a bias piece of the material to be used.
    Begin at the center back and pin the fold in position, bringing it around
    to the center front. This is not permanent work&#8212;it serves merely as
    a guide for the future work.</p>
  <p>4. Beginning at the center front, stretch this bias towards the side. It
    must be so flat that it appears glued to the frame; but be sure that it is
    not stretched so much that it curls up.</p>
  <p>5. Pin in place, being sure that the points of the pins run toward the headsize
    and are about one inch apart all around.</p>
  <p>6. When you reach the center back, cut the material on the bias, turn on
    the bias, and fold over to form a line that runs in the same direction as
    the seams in the bias fold. One of the most important things to remember
    in split work is to have all seams come in the correct position. A seam in
    the center front indicates poor workmanship.</p>
  <p>7. Using the even basting stitch, sew in position. Make the stitch three-quarters
    of an inch long on the side you are working and three-eighths inch on the
    other side. Start sewing at the center front and work towards the back at
    both sides of the hat. Do not attempt to work all around. Remove the pins
    as quickly as the work is completed.</p>
  <p>8. To apply the second fold, proceed in the same manner. This second fold
    must be so placed that it hides the raw edge and the stitching of the first
    fold. If the brim is sharply curved, it may be necessary to catch the folded
    edge of the bias pieces to the frame. But on ordinary frames or flat frames
    this will not be necessary if the work is properly done. Neat workmanship
    is extremely important.</p>
  <p>9. If you are applying braid or ribbon binding instead of folds of the material,
    the process is the same, except that the braid or ribbon is basted to the
    finished hat and then machine-stitched. Straw braid is similarly applied,
    the stitch being three-eighths and one-eighth inch long. Practice with scraps
    of material and with one of the frames you have made until you can do split
    work quickly, easily and attractively.</p>
  <h3><a name="economy" id="economy"></a>Economy in Millinery</h3>
  <p>The good milliner knows how to save time, and how to save money. She is
    jealous of every minute, and careful of every penny that is spent. She buys
    her materials judiciously and never wastes an inch of ribbon or material
    if she can avoid it.</p>
  <p>It is a wise plan to have a piece-bag, into which you can put all your small,
    left-over pieces of material. You can never tell when even a two-inch piece
    of ribbon is going to be just what you need to finish a flower or a bow.
    There are countless ways of utilizing small bits of materials, and they should
    never be thrown away.</p>
  <p>To save time, tag your piece-bag. With a large safety pin attach to the
    outside of the bag a tiny sample of all the remnants that go into your bag.
    Then, when you are looking for a piece of black satin, or red velvet, or
    pink taffeta, you won't have to search all through your bag. Just look at
    the samples on the outside of the bag, see if you can match the material
    you want, and if you can&#8212;then it is time enough to find it in the piece-bag.
    Of course, as soon as a remnant is used up, remove the sample from the safety
    pin.</p>
  <p>There are many other ways of saving time and money in millinery, but we
    will take these up individually as we come to them.</p>
  <h3><a name="ripping" id="ripping"></a>Ripping Hats</h3>
  <p>Very often you will tire of a hat or find that for some reason it has become
    unbecoming. Rather than send it to the scrap heap you may want to use the
    materials to make another hat. It is important that you do not ruin the materials
    while ripping them apart.</p>
  <p>Never pull threads, as this leaves holes in the material. Cut them with
    a pair of small scissors. The scissors should be very keen and the blades
    narrow. You may find, after ripping, that it is a tedious and difficult job
    to pick the threads from the seams. Dampen a piece of coarse cloth, such
    as toweling, rub it over the seams, and the threads will come out very easily.</p>
  <p>Before ripping a covering made for a crown, decide upon the new hat you
    want and then see if the old crown is not satisfactory. Then, with a new
    brim, you will have an entirely new hat.</p>
  <p>Materials should always be refreshed and very often cleaned before being
    used again. This subject is covered completely in a later lesson.</p>
  <h3><a name="scraps" id="scraps"></a>Making Use of Scraps</h3>
  <p>Being an expert milliner does not indicate, necessarily, that you must confine
    yourself solely to the making of hats. You will be a better milliner if you
    are economical&#8212;and you will be economical if you utilize all the scraps
    in your piece-bag.</p>
  <p>There are many pretty, novel pin cushions that can be made of left-over
    bits of velvet and satin. Other pretty novelties can be made that are appropriate
    for holiday gifts&#8212;such as powder boxes, pillows, hand-bags, pin trays.
    If you have quite a large piece of left-over ribbon or satin, you can make
    a dainty electric light bulb cover, or a doll for the telephone.</p>
  <h3><a name="useful" id="useful"></a>More Useful Hints</h3>
  <p>1. When it becomes necessary to press loops or bows on a hat because they
    have been mussed, it is best to press them from the inside with a heated
    curling iron. In this way, it is unnecessary for the bows to be removed.
    This plan is especially recommended to those who travel or live at hotels.
    Indeed, the heated curling iron is a very useful article and will be found
    to serve the purpose of an iron many times. </p>
  <p>2. Some beginners in millinery find difficulty in holding the hat while
    trimming it. To have your left hand free to hold ribbons, flowers or lining,
    pin the hat firmly to your skirt at the knee with a hat pin. This will obviate
    the necessity of holding the hat.</p>
  <p>3. When you find that your straw hat, or hat made of straw braid, has become
    stiff and brittle and inclined to break in spots, you can know that it needs
    a good steaming. This will make the straw soft again and you will be able
    to manipulate it in any way you please.</p>
  <p>4. If you find that a feather or two has dropped from your black feather
    ornament, drop a few drops of black ink into your jar of library paste and
    paste them back again. If you used the paste without the ink, it would show.
    But if you do not wish to blacken your entire jar of paste, simply pour a
    little into a saucer and drop the ink into it then.</p>
  <p>5. If your scissors become dull, you can sharpen them by opening and closing
    them quickly on a glass or piece of glass, as though you were trying to cut
    it.</p>
  <p>6. Neat milliners have small pegs in the bottom of their sewing machine
    drawers on which to place their spools of thread. This keeps the threads
    from becoming tangled, and incidentally keeps the drawers neat and tidy.
    And, after all, nothing is more an indication of good workmanship than tidiness.</p>
  <p>7. All buckram and stiff materials that are used in making frames should
    be handled with the balls or tips of the fingers. This prevents breaking
    and making sharp lines in the material. Wires should also be handled this
    way.</p>
  <p>8.	The nap of velvet should always run from front to back on all hats.</p>
  <p>9. If wire for frames must be pieced, use milliners' clamps. These can be
    purchased at a milliners' supply house. They make a smooth, fine joining.</p>
  <p>10. Plain coverings for hats should be so flat that they appear to be glued.
    This effect cannot be achieved if the material is stretched. It must simply
    be made as smooth as possible without stretching too much.</p>
  <p>11. All stitches in millinery begin at the center of the front. The material
    is pinned on the hat and finished at the center of the back. But when sewed,
    one side must be completed first, then the other.</p>
  <p>12. In attaching linings, the seam in the lining should always be at the
    center back.</p>
  <p>13.	Never leave selvages on the materials used in millinery.</p>
  <p>14. Always make paper patterns of hats to be cut from buckram. These paper
    patterns are useful in cutting the material for covering the frames.</p>
  <p>15. If buckram frames are broken, shellac the broken places to restore shape
    and line.</p>
  <p>16. When cutting sheer materials, such as chiffon or georgette, it is wise
    to draw a thread through as a guide line.</p>
  <h3><a name="terms" id="terms"></a>Terms Used in Millinery</h3>

    be made entirely of straw or may be straw and net. Usually they are woven

    color, making a beautiful cloth or ribbon. Beautiful for trimming purposes. </p>

    is made in cone shapes of different sizes and later pressed or blocked in
    shape for a hat.</p>

    weaving, producing a soft toned effect.</p>

    as tin or zinc, to silks to give added weight. Some thin silks are weighted
    with sugar.</p>
  <p>WOOF OR FILLING&#8212;The thread running from selvage to selvage or across
    the cloth.</p>

    It is so necessary to get a good firm foundation before attempting to make
    a hat, as well as a thorough understanding of the various methods used. It
    is for this very reason that I thought it best to give you this lesson before
    you took up the different ways of covering crowns and brims.</p>

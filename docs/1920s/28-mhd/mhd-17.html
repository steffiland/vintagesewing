  <h3>    <a name="planning" id="planning"></a>Planning a Hat</h3>
  <p>Let us pretend that you want a new hat, or that you wish to make a hat for
    one of your friends. What are the first things to take into consideration?
    What should the material be, the trimming, the type of frame? What is the
    very first thing to think about?</p>
  <p>Before anything else, you must take the season into consideration. Is it
    summer, or winter, or in-between season? Is Spring just around the corner,
    or will Fall soon be here? The type of hat and the materials and trimmings
    depend almost entirely upon the season.</p>
  <p>You have learned that after season, harmony of color, suitability with the
    rest of the costume, individuality and personality must be taken into consideration.
    Having weighed all these important points in our mind, let us now see how
    we proceed with the actual planning of the hat.</p>
  <p>First, of course, we decide on the color. If it is to be a hat that will
    be worn constantly&#8212;to business, let us say&#8212;it is wisest to choose
    a color that will harmonize with the most of our clothes. Paisley patterns
    from time to time enjoy quite a vogue in millinery. When the colors are of
    the more conventional shades of gold, red and blue, the paisley hat &quot;goes&quot; with
    almost any costume. A dark blue hat is always appropriate, and black is ideal
    for those who can wear it.</p>
  <p>But perhaps, the hat is for some special occasion, to be worn with some
    special dress or wrap. Then choose a color that either harmonizes or matches&#8212;but
    be very careful that your dress is not one shade of light blue and your hat
    another shade of light blue. Remember that colors must either match absolutely,
    or be of some contrasting, harmonizing color.</p>
  <p>The color decided upon, we now determine the best place to purchase the
    material, and indeed, what kind of material it shall be. In previous lessons
    you were taught the correct materials for various hat occasions, but it is
    important that you know also how to buy these materials.</p>
  <p>The various kinds of materials have been described so that you should have
    no trouble in recognizing them at once. If you cannot distinguish good quality
    velvet from poor quality, if you cannot recognize satin when you see it,
    or duvetyne&#8212;refer to the lesson and review it until you know all the
    materials thoroughly.</p>
  <p>When purchasing materials, always look at them in daylight. Colors sometimes
    appear very different under electric light, and it is best to look at them
    in both lights. Then you can make no mistake in color or texture. Be careful
    not to purchase more material than you need. When purchasing velvet and duvetyne,
    and other pile materials, it is best to buy the material on the bias for
    the tip, or upper crown. Most millinery supply shops cut one end of the material
    on the bias for the convenience of their patrons.</p>
  <p>After buying the piece of bias material for the tip, have the other end
    of the material used for the brim, purchasing as much as you need of the
    length of the material. Use a tape measure to determine how much you will
    require for the brim and how much for the space between tip and brim that
    is not covered by the bias.</p>
  <h3><a name="frame" id="frame"></a>The Frame</h3>
  <p>You must now decide what kind of shape you want. This is the time to determine
    your own requirements, the lines that are most becoming to you. Have you
    a full, round face; an oval face; a small, tip-tilted nose? Refer to the
    last lesson and find out exactly what type of hat is most becoming to you.
    Remember that the more you review your lessons, the more you refer to them,
    the deeper they will be impressed upon your memory and the more readily you
    will be able to recall them.</p>
  <p>Certain materials and shapes require buckram frames; others require wire
    frames. Do you know what type of frame to employ for the hat you have in
    mind&#8212;the materials and trimmings you have in mind? Perhaps the frame
    is one you can purchase easily; it may be one you prefer to make yourself.
    All these details are important and should be given careful consideration.</p>
  <p>Of course, to be an expert, competent milliner you should be able to make
    all types of frames, whether from buckram or wire. But very often you will
    be able to obtain just the frame you want in a millinery supply shop, at
    a very small cost. It is better to purchase the frame under these circumstances
    than to take the time to make it.</p>
  <h3><a name="choice" id="choice"></a>Choice of Trimmings</h3>
  <p>Sometimes it is best to select the trimming after the frame is covered.
    You may purchase a trimming before covering the hat, and when it is covered
    find that the trimming gives an entirely different effect than you had planned
    for. But if you expect to have just one rose on a black velvet hat, or one
    bit of jade on a satin hat, you may safely purchase it beforehand.</p>
  <p>When purchasing trimmings, always take suitability and harmony into careful
    consideration. Harmony, not only in color, but between the type of hat and
    the type of trimming, between the season and the trimming, between the wearer
    and the trimming. Your choice of trimmings is very important and you should
    devote a great deal of your time in studying the various types of trimmings
    on display in millinery supply shops and department stores. It is the best
    possible plan for developing taste in the matter of hat-trimming.</p>
  <p>A hat can be entirely devoid of trimming, and yet smart and attractive.
    The simple fold in the material of a hat, or rows of folds, are often employed.
    Sometimes the French, or triple-fold trimming is used, and sometimes nothing
    but a simple ribbon band encircles the crown. Trimming does not always mean
    elaboration, and it depends entirely upon your good taste and judgment to
    determine what type of trimming&#8212;or whether any trimming at all&#8212;is
    needed.</p>
  <h3><a name="styles" id="styles"></a>A Few Suggestions on Hat Styles</h3>
  <p>We are going to show here several types of hats, trimmed and finished. We
    must remember that hats change with each new season, but the same style recurs
    in a little different form no matter what the prevailing mode may be. This
    is what makes millinery so interesting because if the fundamentals are mastered,
    it is merely a matter of using your own good judgment in copying designs
    and the applying of the correct trimmings.</p>
  <p>It will be helpful to you to study these hats carefully, determine what
    colors, materials and trimming could be used, and whether you would have
    trimmed the shapes in the same way. Pick out the hat that you think would
    be most becoming to you&#8212;and the one you think would be the least becoming.
    See if you can give yourself logical reasons for your choice.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illus/17-01-fig1.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,422);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/17-01-fig1-t.jpg" alt="Figure 1" width="134" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Fig. 1 shows a very pretty quilted taffeta hat. It is very soft in effect
    and is an admirable example of a small hat which is worn so much with sport
    costumes. This particular model is made of a pale rose georgette smoothly
    placed over felt. The surface is stitched in diagonal crossings in the brim,
    side crown and top. The edge is finished with binding of narrow self-colored
    ribbon. At one side is placed a large flower of cut felt, the petals resembling
    a gardenia, and the whole has been carried out in the same tone. Such lovely
    pastel tints are used in these dainty hats.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illus/17-02-fig2.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,592);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/17-02-fig2-t.jpg" alt="Figure 2" width="191" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>For midsummer, when one must express the joy of sun and trees and flowers,
    there can be nothing more charming than the drooping brim hat such as is
    shown in Fig. 2. This hat may be made of horsebraid, or the crown made of
    this braid and the brim of satin, faced with a light colored crepe or georgette.
    A band of self colored grosgrain ribbon is placed around the crown and the
    flowers may be made or purchased just as you desire.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illus/17-03-fig3.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,370);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/17-03-fig3-t.jpg" alt="Figure 3" width="117" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Glance atFig. 3 and see what can be accomplished by the use of novelty
    braid. This hat is not only very smart in its development but charmingly
    youthful. It may be made of any color braid you desire. A scarf of harmonizing
    colors is knotted on the right side. A plaid trimming in bright colors is
    very much a la mode.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illus/17-04-fig4.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,360);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/17-04-fig4-t.jpg" alt="Figure 4" width="113" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Fig. 4 shows a peak crowned poke with a scalloped brim. It may be made of
    satin and ! straw or entirely of either material. A
    novel feature is shown in the ornamental arrangement of smocked ribbon immediately
    in front, and the whole hat is an admirable example of a close-fitting
    style. It is necessary, of course, that the smocking be perfectly made as
    any fault in this detail would ruin the style of the hat. The shape would
    be pretty covered with orchid, Copenhagen, maize or
    monkeyskin satin, and then the simplicity of trim, the smocking, is the feature
    that commends it to millinery contingent. Attention is also directed to the
peak point of the crown, and the scalloped brim, which also share the novelty.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illus/17-05-fig5.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,540);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/17-05-fig5-t.jpg" alt="Figure 5" width="173" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Of the making of useful black hats there is no end, and likewise there is
    no limit to the combinations that may be devised. Fig. 5 shows straw combined
      with black felt or velvet could be used if you desire. The brim is turned
      up at the right front and the edges on both sides of this cut are rounded,
      the left side retaining its original pattern, while the right side is held
      up against the crown by a flat, pointed double pin of rhinestones.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illus/17-06-fig6.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,430);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/17-06-fig6-t.jpg" alt="Figure 6" width="137" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Fig. 6 is a charming model showing fancy black straw as the foundation.
    It is finished with a wonderful halo of black felt or any color could be
    used. This felt covers the crown top from side to side, a narrow bandeau
    of felt forming a finish all around. The outstanding feature of this model
    is the two upright silver whips which ornament each side, their ends twisted
    in a decorative manner which makes them appear almost like earrings. The
    very simplicity of this style makes it in keeping with the best modes of
    the moment. Of course, bengaline, satin, velvet, or crepe de chine, may be
    substituted for the felt.</p>
  <p>Has the survey of these six types of hats helped you to visualize the hats
    you intend making? Have you picked out the one most becoming to you, the
    one you feel would look best if you could actually try the hats on? If you
    have studied this lesson correctly, if you have spent at least five minutes
    studying each hat and suggesting in your own mind different methods of trimming,
    finishing, etc., you should now be able to plan hats for yourself without
    the least hesitancy or trouble.</p>
  <p>Decide upon the type of hat, according to season. Choose the color most
    becoming to you and most in accord with your present requirements (according
    to costume). Buy your materials, decide on your trimmings, actually make
    and finish a hat for yourself. Even though it falls far below your expectations,
    make it so that you may compare it later with the hats you make when the
    course is completed, so that you may find your mistakes by actual experience
    learn to avoid them.</p>
  <p>Or, if you prefer, finish this lesson first, and then make a hat for yourself.
    But be always on the alert for new ideas, for style and trimming suggestions.
    Wherever you chance to be, study the hats that people are wearing and that
    shops are showing. In this way you will assimilate much information and a
    great many helpful ideas that will prove valuable later.</p>
  <h3><a name="copy" id="copy"></a>How to Copy a Hat</h3>
  <p>Very often, instead of planning a hat, you will find occasion to copy some
    distinctive shape you have seen, and depend solely upon attractive touches
    of trimming to create an individual touch. There is an art to copying a hat&#8212;just
    as there is an art to creating a hat seen only in your mind's eye. Indeed,
    to some people the actual copying of a hat seen in a shop window presents
    more of a problem than the inception of an original style.</p>
  <p>Let us see, then, just how we will proceed with the copying of a hat we
    see in a shop window or on some fashionable woman we have met at tea. Of
    course, if a picture of the hat is available, our work will be made very
    much simpler for we will be able to take exact measurements. But if we catch
    only a fleeting glimpse of the hat we must depend upon our judgment of proportions.</p>
  <p>In either case, whether we see the hat itself or a picture of it, we must
    first make a wire frame of the shape. We say wire frame because wire is easiest
    to work with, can be adjusted easily, changed and made to suit. If a buckram
    or willow frame is desired, the wire frame may be used as a pattern.</p>
  <p>When you see a hat that you want to copy, first make careful note of its
    lines. Try to visualize the skeleton frame&#8212;the hat without the trimming.
    If you can, make a rough sketch of the frame&#8212;but a mental sketch will
    do if you have a retentive memory.</p>
  <p>As soon as you can, to obviate the possibility of forgetting the correct
    lines, make a wire frame of the shape you have seen. Begin with the headsize
    band as taught in a previous lesson; put on the brace wires and proceed step
    by step to build up a frame pattern of the shape you have seen. Fasten the
    wires together loosely so that the hat may be made smaller or enlarged if
    found necessary, and bend the brace wires to take the exact shape of the
    frame you have seen.</p>
  <p>Of course, if you have the hat in front of you, your work will be greatly
    facilitated. No matter how odd or unusual the shape of the hat may be, if
    you have a model of it in your hands you will be able to make a wire duplicate
    of it, even though you are not able to make a paper pattern of it. Then,
    too, you can take the exact measurements right from the hat in your hands.</p>
  <p>As before, make the headsize band first, and proceed step by step with your
    frame. When you have completed the wire frame, compare your copy with the
    original to prove the accuracy of your work. Measure the length of the brace
    wires and compare with measurements taken at the identical points on the
    hat you
    are copying. Make other measurements to prove that you have made an exact
    duplicate.</p>
  <p>Just one word of caution, regarding the copying of hats. In gauging the
    proportions of a hat, always be sure that you observe personal requirements
    carefully and that you use your best judgment. Do not attempt to copy a hat
    meant for a tall, blonde person if the hat is intended for a short person
    with dark hair. Take the face into consideration and learn to judge accurately
    just what length of the brace wires will make a becoming brim. Accurate judgment
    is of inestimable help to the milliner, and fortunately it is one of the &quot;knacks&quot; that
    can be developed.</p>
  <p>Always study the hat you are going to copy carefully and through this careful
    observation get as accurate an idea as possible of the proportions of the
    hat. Copy it, and then alter it to suit the requirements of the particular
    face for which it is being made. Above everything else, always be guided
    by the consideration of balance, rhythm and proportions&#8212;the three features
    of design which have been taken up in earlier lessons.</p>
  <p>The trimming of a hat can be very easily copied, of course, but one need
    not necessarily choose a certain trimming just because it happens to grace
    the frame one is copying. Frequently, a slight change of trimming, a slight
    variation in the method of applying the trimming or even in the draping of
    the brim, alters the hat and gives to it a distinct, new design. This, too,
    has been taken up more in detail in earlier lessons.</p>
  <p>Suppose you glance through a fashion magazine and select an attractive hat&#8212;a
    hat you would like to have. Try to make a duplicate of the hat. Omit the
    trimming if you like, but make an exact duplicate of the shape. Don't be
    afraid to attempt it. Remember that you could not hope to enter the Olympic
    races after having taken but one swimming lesson. Nor can you expect to make
    a prize-winning hat while you are still studying the very fundamental principles
    of millinery and millinery design. And remember that each little bit of construction
    work you do in millinery makes you just so much more deft and skilled in
    the art of molding buckram, wire, materials and trimmings into beautiful
    hats.</p>
  <p>Experiment, then, and see how nearly you can duplicate a shape that attracts
    you. And if you frankly want to master the principles of millinery and become
    a clever creator of fashionable hats, keep practicing and experimenting until
    you can duplicate exactly any hat you see. </p>

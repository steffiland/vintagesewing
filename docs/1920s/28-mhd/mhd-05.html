  <h3>    <a name="uses" id="uses"></a>Uses of Wires in Millinery</h3>
  <p>Just as an architect first plans his building, so must the milliner first
    plan her hat. And when she has her plans she must, like the architect, first
    build the foundation. The foundations of a great many hats are wire frames.</p>
  <p>But it is not only for the making of wire frames that wire plays so important
    a part in millinery. It is used also for wiring lace and ribbon, for edging
    buckram frames, for cordings&#8212;and for various other purposes. Of course
    there are different wires for different uses, and the purpose of this lesson
    is to acquaint you with their names and their characteristics.</p>
  <p>For instance, there is Frame wire, which is also known as Brace wire. It
    is used almost exclusively for the making of hat frames, but is used extensively
    also for edging buckram frames. One of the very first things you should learn
    in the matter of millinery wires is using pliers correctly. You should be
    able to use the pliers with ease, to be able to make a fine, clean cut without
    tearing the covering of the wire. You should also be deft in catching the
    end of the wire with the pliers and turning it down at right angles. This
    is something that cannot be taught; deftness in the use of the pliers comes
    only with practice.</p>
  <p>The heaviest wire used in millinery is called Cable wire. Sometimes it is
    used for an entire frame, but most frequently it is used solely for wire-edging.
    Sometimes it is silk-covered and is used as a frame for a transparent hat,
    and it is sometimes used as a cord on the under side of a brim. Silk-covered
    Cable wire comes in several different sizes and many shades.</p>
  <p>Lace wire is a millinery wire that is finer than Brace wire, and it is used
    for wiring ribbons, laces and flowers. It has many practical uses, and is
    sometimes even used for making an entire frame&#8212;especially when a particularly
    light-weight frame for a dainty summer hat is required. The finest wire used
    in millinery is called Tie Wire. It comes in three colors: black, white and
    green. It is used for tying other wires in place, and is also used a great
    deal in making hand-made flowers. This wire is also made uncovered, but this
    is not entirely satisfactory.</p>
  <p>A special wire used for wiring ribbons&#8212;either on the edges, through
    the center, or both&#8212;is called Ribbon wire. It is used also for making
    loops and bows. It comes in various widths and may be had in black or white.</p>
  <p>Another millinery wire is called Sprung or Spring wire. It is made of steel
    and is fitted with a milliner's clasp. As it is not easily bent, it is not
    used on a shaped hat, but it is used on the edge of straight brims and for
    the edge of brims of transparent hats.</p>
  <p>These are the important millinery wires. Now that you know their names and
    their uses, suppose we proceed at once with the making of a wire frame and
    see just what the correct process is.</p>
  <h3><a name="tying" id="tying"></a>Methods of Tying Wires</h3>
  <p>Before you can proceed with the making of a wire frame, you must have all
    the necessary equipment. You will need brace wire, tie wire and pliers. You
    will require also a tape line and a yard stick or rule, and if the hat is
    to be a flat shape or a transparent brim you will need spring wire for the
    edge.</p>
  <p>Brace wire is purchased in coils. Unless properly handled, the coils will
    become tangled and you will have difficulty with the wire. To open the coil,
    hold it in the left hand, and with the pliers in the right hand, cut the
    tie wire which holds the coil together. Then place both hands within the
    coil and roll them in a circular motion. This will loosen the coil of wire.
    Thus the individual coils will be separated and the wire will be easily handled.</p>
  <p>To cut wire, grasp the pliers firmly in the hand, placing the wire squarely
    in the jaws of the pliers and bring the jaws firmly together. The wire should
    be cut square and clean, without any injury to the covering. When wire is
    taken from the coil it naturally retains the coiled shape. To straighten
    it, before cutting, take a piece of heavy cloth or velvet between the fingers
    and thumb and pass the wire between the thumb and finger with a sweeping
    motion. Do not bend or make small dents in the wire, as they cannot be removed
    once they are made.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illus/05-01-fig1.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',418,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/05-01-fig1-t.jpg" alt="Figure 1. Tie wires" width="220" height="109" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>There are three different ways to tie wire in making hat frames. Brace wire
    is placed in such a manner that the ends are parallel and lap one inch. Take
    a piece of tie wire and bring it around the brace wire once as close to the
    end of the wire as possible. Hold the wires in the left hand, and with the
    pliers held in the right hand, grasp the ends of the tie wire as closely
     to the brace wire as possible and twist tightly until the joining is firm.
    Then slide the pliers back on the tie wires and make several turns in the
    wire to be sure that the joining will remain secure. Cut off the ends of
    the wire, allowing about one-eighth of an inch of the twisted wire to remain.
    Press this end down close to the brace wire with the jaws of the pliers,
    and be sure that the joining is made as flat as possible. Tie the other end
    of the wire in the same manner.</p>
  <p>    When wires cross at right angles, it is sometimes necessary to tie them.
      The tie wire is brought across the wires diagonally and tied in exactly
      the same manner as the parallel wires are tied. This joining, too, must
      be made as flat as possible. Wires that cross at right angles are sometimes
      tied without the use of the tie wire. One of the wires is wrapped firmly
      around the other, and in this manner the tie is made. The brace wires should
      be on the under side of the brim. For making these ties or twists on a
      brim it is necessary to allow at least two inches on the brace wire. When
      the brace wire is in position, crossing the stay in just the proper place,
      hold these two wires in position with the left hand and give the brace
      wire one and one-half turns around the stay wire, turning it very close
      to the other wire. Press this tie flat with the jaws of the pliers, making
      it firm and smooth.</p>
  <h3><a name="named" id="named"></a>Various Hat Wires Named</h3>
  <p>Not only are there various types of hat wires, but there are various names
    given to hat wires which are used in certain positions. Wires going around
    the hat, either in crown or brim, are stay wires. Wherever you see the phrase &quot;stay
    wires&quot; used you will know that it means this. The wires used to keep
    the stay wires in position, which run from the center of the crown to the
    edge of the brim, are known as brace wires.</p>
  <p>Wires are named also according to the positions they occupy. There is the
    center front wire, which extends from the top of the crown or from the headsize
    to the center front. From either of the two points before mentioned to the
    center back extends what is known as the center back wire. The other wires
    are named right side, left side, right side front, left side front, right
    side back and left side back according to their position. These are familiarly
    known in millinery as the eight points of the hat. The wire at the edge of
    the hat brim is called the edge wire. The brace wires should always be evenly
    spaced, as it makes the hat more comfortable and more attractive.</p>
  <p>The hat is in two pieces. The wire at the top of the crown is called the
    crown top and the one at the bottom is called the crown base. The wire which
    is next to the headsize is called the headsize wire.</p>
  <p>The actual making of the wire frame is more largely a matter of mechanical
    skill than anything else. If you are capable of handling the pliers correctly,
    of measuring the wires properly, you will have no trouble in making the frame.
    All that is needed is plenty of practice. Having mastered the method of making
    wire frames, you will find that it is an easy matter to vary a shape into
    any style desired. The crown may be made a square crown or a round crown
    by varying the angle or curve or length of the wire. A brim can be made to
    roll or droop, or it may be narrow or wide by varying the length and curve
    of the stay and brace wires.</p>
  <p>You may use as many stay wires as you please to make the frame firm and
    rigid. Unless it is firm and rigid, the frame will not be satisfactory. The
    finished hat will not retain its shape, and it will not fit comfortably.</p>
  <h3><a name="frames" id="frames"></a>Wire Frames</h3>
  <p>Now we want to learn all the important things about making a wire shape.
    This wire shape is perhaps the most important branch of millinery because
    it is the basis for almost all frame work. If you want to learn how to copy
    models or create your own designs you may reproduce any exclusive model you
    see by 
    making a neat wire frame. It serves as a block for molding many frames, made
    of buckram, cape net or similar materials.</p>
  <p>The first thing to be considered when making hat frames is the headsize.
    If this is not correct the hat will not only be uncomfortable but it will
    be unbecoming as well. Hats and frames are made in sizes which vary each
    season. Some seasons the hats are worn well down over the head, at other
    times the mode requires the hat to be worn higher on the head, this style
    requiring a smaller headsize.</p>
  <p>The headsize wire of the crown must be larger than that of the brim in order
    that the crown may fit down on the brim.</p>
  <p>The brim of the frame must be made first, as follows: </p>
  <p class="clear"> <em><a href="illus/05-02-fig2.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,648);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/05-02-fig2-t.jpg" alt="Figure 2. First stetp in making wire brim" width="209" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>1. To find the headsize, take a piece of brace wire and fit it around the
        head just at the line where the hat is to rest. The hair should be dressed
        as it is to be when the hat is worn. This headsize wire must have an
    allowance of one inch on each end for lapping and must be large enough so
    the tips
        of two fingers may be pushed beneath it. This is the allowance necessary
        for lining and materials which must come on the inside of the hat.</p>
  <p>2. Join this headsize wire at the center back, using tie wire to secure
    it as was taught in the earlier part of this lesson.</p>
  <p>3. Cut four wires the length of the diameter of the entire hat plus three
    inches. The three inches is allowed for tying at the edge.</p>
  <p>4. Place one of these wires across the headsize wire extending from front
    to back, using tie wire to tie this wire in place temporarily.</p>
  <p>5. Place a second wire across the headsize wire extending from side to side.
    Secure this with tie wire just as you did the first wire.</p>
  <p>6. The other two wires are now to be placed across the headsize half way
    between the first and second wire and these should be tied lightly to hold
    them in place, until the permanent tie is made.</p>
  <p>7. For flat hat shapes such as the sailor shape we are making the edge wire
    must be of spring wire. This must be the exact length of the circumference
    or outer edge of the brim, this will be joined by using a milliners clasp.</p>
  <p>8. This joining should come at the center back of the hat, and the edge
    wire must be placed beneath the stay wires. On a flat shape the stay wires
    are always placed beneath the brace wires. If the brim turns up the stay
    wires are on top of the brace wires in order that the side of the brim which
    shows the most will be as smooth as possible. Measure from the headsize and
    mark the width of the brim on each brace wire.</p>
  <p>9. Beginning at the center back tie the brace wire around the edge wire
    by turning the end of this wire once and a half around the edge wire. This
    tie must be made at the mark just made on the stay wire.</p>
  <p>10. Be sure that each wire is in its proper place and meets the edge wire
    at one of the eight points and tie these wires in position just as the center
    back wire has been tied. Use the pliers to make these joinings flat and firm
    and trim the brace wires very close to the edge wire making all these joinings
    just as neat as possible.</p>
  <p>11. Your frame is now ready to tie the headsize wire permanently in position.
    Cut the brace wires where they cross in the center of the headsize, and turn
    these ends upward at right angles to the wires in the brim, and tie them
    firmly to the headsize wire in their proper positions by turning the brace
    wire once and one-half times around the headsize wire bringing the brace
    wire to an upright position to form the side of the crown or the collar as
    this is sometimes called. Tie each one removing the temporary tie made with
    tie wire.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illus/05-03-fig3.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',422,665);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/05-03-fig3-t.jpg" alt="Figure 3. Wire brim" width="240" height="150" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>12. Make a second headsize wire the exact size of the first one made. Tie
    this in position above the first one just as you tied the first one to the
    brace wires. 
    This side crown may be high or low as the style of the hat requires. If a
    wire crown is to be used on this brim this second headsize wire should be
    one inch above the first as shown in illustration. If a soft crown is to
    be used with no wire frame beneath it the second headsize wire may be any
    distance above the first that is necessary to hold the soft crown in position
    at the headsize. Usually this is about two or two and a half inches. With
    the pliers make all ties as flat as possible, 
    trim the ends of the wires closely, and see that the frame looks neat in
    every detail.</p>
  <p>13. If your brim is more than 3 inches wide it will be necessary to make
    a stay wire and tie it in position at a point one half way between the headsize
    wire and the edge wire. This wire is tied in position by the use of the tie
    wire using the diagonal tie.</p>
  <p>14. After the brim is finished, pull it gently from center front to center
    back in order to shape the headsize so that it will be about one inch longer
    from front to back than it is from side to side.</p>
  <p>When the crown is made it is shaped in the same way so that the two will
    go together easily and the hat be made comfortable for the wearer. This finishes
    the brim. The next step in making the frame is to make the crown.</p>
  <h3><a name="crown" id="crown"></a>Making the Crown</h3>
  <p>When measuring for the headsize wire for the crown we must remember to make
    this large enough so the crown will set down over the collar or crown of
    the brim. So allow this wire a little longer than the headsize wire for the
    brim.</p>
  <p>1. Measure for this length and tie the headsize wire exactly as you did
    when the brim was started.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illus/05-04-fig4.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,625);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/05-04-fig4-t.jpg" alt="Figure 4. Round crown" width="202" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>2. The next step is to determine the length of the wires which form the
    crown. The length of these wires determines the height of the crown. If these
    wires are long, the crown will be high, if short the crown will be low. The
    worker must use her own judgment in determining the length of these wires.
    The curves made in these wires determine the shape of the crown. For instance,
    a round crown has a gentle curve from the top of the crown to the headsize
    wire, while a square crown is straight from the headsize wire to the crown
    top wire and is flat on top. We will first consider the round crown. Determine
    the length of your wires from center of the back to center of the front of
    the headsize wire and allow two inches at each end for work. Cut this wire,
    and three others exactly like it. Bend these wires as shown in Fig. 4. The
    sharp bend is exactly two inches from the ends of the wire if you have been
    exact in allowing two inches for work. </p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illus/05-05-fig5.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',142,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/05-05-fig5-t.jpg" alt="Figure 5. Guide for marking head size wires" width="393" height="60" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>3. Prepare a strip of paper the length of the headsize and divide it in
    eight equal sections as shown in Fig. 5. Cut one of these sections from the
    strip and using it as a guide mark your headsize wire in sections this length.
    This establishes the eight points of the crown. Take one of the brace wires
    just prepared and tie it to the headsize wire at center front and center
    back. Remember that the joining of your headsize wire must be at the center
    back. Now tie the side wire in position. The other two wires will be tied
    in the same way in their proper places. Tie these wires to the headsize wire
    by wrapping the brace wire one and one-half times around the headsize wire.</p>
  <p><em><a href="illus/05-06-fig6.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,615);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/05-06-fig6-t.jpg" alt="Figure 6. Round crown" width="198" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>4. The crown on a hat is very much more comfortable if it is a little longer
    from front to back than from side to side, so take the crown and gently pull
    it from end to end in order to shape it in this way. It should measure about
    one inch longer from front to back than from side to side. When the mode
    requires large crowns, hats very often look better if the crown is a little
    smaller at the top than at the bottom, that is, that the curve or slant of
    the wires begins exactly at the headsize. In this case the second stay wire
    will be made a little smaller than the headsize wire. This wire is prepared
    just as the headsize wire was prepared and tied in position two inches above
    it. Use tie wire and the diagonal tie. A second wire is prepared as the headsize
    wire was prepared and tied to the brace wires about two inches above the
    first wire. A small circle of wire is tied to the brace wires about an inch
    and a half or two inches from the center of the crown. These stay wires should
    be about equal distance apart when the crown is finished, although the wires
    at the top of the crown may be closer together than the ones at the side.
    A great deal will depend on the size of your crown in regulating the position
    of these wires. This finishes the round crown.</p>
  <h3><a name="square" id="square"></a>The Square Crown</h3>
  <p class="clear">The wires<em><a href="illus/05-07-fig7.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,623);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/05-07-fig7-t.jpg" alt="Figure 7. Square crown" width="201" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em> for a square crown are prepared in exactly the same way as the
    wires for a round crown except they are bent in a different shape. They are
    bent into shape in the following manner.</p>
  <p>1. Cut the wires the proper length, allowing for work. Find the center of
    the brace wire, and at a point where the crown top wire is to come, make
    a sharp downward turn forming a right angle. This must be repeated on the
    other half of the wire.</p>
  <p>2. At the point where the headsize wire is to be applied turn the wires
    outward just as in the round crown. Bend the other three brace wires in exactly
    the same way.</p>
  <p>3. Tie these brace wires to the headsize wire in the same way as in the
    round crown. Mark on the headsize wire the eight points in order to bring
    these wires exactly in their proper position.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illus/05-08-fig8.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,613);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/05-08-fig8-t.jpg" alt="Figure 8. Square crown" width="198" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>4. Shape your headsize by gently pulling it from front to back to make it
    about one inch longer than it is from side to side.</p>
  <p>5. Prepare the crown top wire and tie this in position just at the bend
    at the top of the crown. These stay wires are on the outside of the brace
    wires and are tied in position with tie wire, making a diagonal tie.</p>
  <p>Another stay wire will be needed between the headsize wire and the crown
    top wire. This may be the exact size of the headsize wire or it may be a
    little smaller. Usually this wire as well as the crown top wire is a trifle
    smaller than the headsize wire. A stay wire must be placed between the crown
    top wire and the center of the crown, and must be tied in position just as
    the other stay wires have been tied. Always remember that stay wires extend
    around the hat and they must be tied in a circle before being applied to
    the crown or brim.</p>
  <h3><a name="mushroom" id="mushroom"></a>Mushroom Shape</h3>
  <p>The mushroom shape with its softly falling brim can be made in the same
    manner as the sailor frame. The only difference is that the brace wires are
    bent down instead of being at right angles to the headsize wire. Care must
    be taken that it isn't bent too far, because it can be very unbecoming if
    not correctly shaped. This mushroom shape may have the brace wires measure
    the same length all the way around or they may be shorter in the back and
    longer on the sides. The edge wire is fastened to the brace wires the same
    as in the sailor shape. These wires should be twisted around the edge wire
    and cut off. The edge wire is put on in the same way, and be sure that all
    joinings overlap at least one inch.</p>
  <p>You must know the names of the wires in a hat and know the position of these
    wires. When measures are given for a wire frame these wires are indicated
    by their initials, for example, F indicates &quot;Front,&quot; L. S. F. indicates &quot;Left
    Side Front,&quot; B indicates &quot;Back&quot; and so on. The measures for
    the frame you are to make are as follows:</p>

  <p>1. These are all the measures necessary for the frame. Cut the stay wires
    for the brim the length of the diameter of the headsize plus the width of
    brim plus two inches on each end. For a hat made from the above measures
    the wire from front to back should measure three and three-quarters inches
    plus two and one-quarter inches plus eight plus two plus two equals eighteen
    inches. The diameter of the headsize may be estimated as one-third of the
    headsize measure. The other wires will be measured and cut 
    in the same length as the longest one necessary. When estimating the length
    of these wires be sure you use the longest measures and add the two inches
    at each end for tying. Having found the exact lengths of the wires proceed
  to cut them. There will be four wires.</p>
  <p>2.	Cut the headsize wires.</p>
  <p>3. Join the headsize wires, using tie wire to secure the ends. Remember,
    the joining of the headsize wires should come in the center back.</p>
  <p>4. Place one of the brace wires across the headsize wire extending from
    front to back. Use tie wire to tie this temporarily in position.</p>
  <p>5. Place another brace wire across the headsize extending from side to side.
    Secure this wire as you did the first.</p>
  <p>6. Place the other two wires across the headsize so they meet the headsize
    wire midway between the wires first fixed in position. Tie these wires in
    place just as you did the first two wires.</p>
  <p>7. From the headsize wire on the center front and center back wire, measure
    and mark the width of the brim at center front and back.</p>
  <p>8. On the wire at left and right side measure the width of the brim from
    the headsize wire, marking this as you did at center front and back. On the
    wires midway between center front and right side mark the width of the brim
    at right side front. On each of the unmarked wires measure the width of the
    brim at these points and mark in the same way.</p>
  <p>9. Prepare an edge wire, tying it as you have been taught. This edge wire
    is now placed on the brace wires at exactly the points you have marked.</p>
  <p>10. Tie this wire in place, by turning the ends of the stay wires around
    the edge wire, one and one-half times as previously taught. Remember that
    this wire determines the roll of the brim on your turban. If you want the
    brim to roll closely to the crown of the turban this wire will be made short
    enough to bring this close to the crown. If on the other hand you want the
    brim to be more like the bowl brim, this wire will be longer. The stay wires
    of course will be bent in a gentle curve from the headsize wire to the edge
    wire so the hat will turn up away from the face.</p>
  <p>11. Midway between the headsize wire and the edge wire another stay wire
    will be tied. Prepare the stay wire, using tie wire to join the ends and
    also to tie it in position.</p>
  <p>12. Now cut the wires where they cross at the center of the headsize. Remove
    the tie wire which tied the headsize wire into position temporarily and tie
    this wire in position with the ends of the wires, wrapping these around the
    headsize wire one and one-half times. When removing these temporary tie wires,
    remove one and tie the headsize wire in place permanently before the next
    temporary tie wire is removed.</p>
  <p>13. Tie the second headsize wire to these brace wires which have been turned
    at right angles to the first headsize wire. This second headsize wire may
    be high or low, but for this hat should not be more than three-quarters of
    an inch above the first wire. This forms the collar over which the crown
    will be fitted.</p>
  <p>14. Trim the ends of the wire at the edge of the crown, making as smooth
    a finish at the edge as possible. Do the same at the headsize and your brim
    is finished.</p>
  <p>Remember that the shape of your hat depends entirely on the length of the
    wires and on the curves made in these wires. Make all ties as flat as possible
    and remember where to use the different ties. You will then have gone a long
    ways toward successful frame making. Be sure you know these things before
    you leave this lesson. Practice and experience are the only things that can
    help you in this work.</p>
  <p>When brims are to be shaped number 21 brace wire or even a heavier wire
    should be used for the edge wire. Spring wire cannot be bent into shape nor
    can it be readily bent out of shape. This is the reason for using it on flat
    sailor shapes.</p>
  <h3><a name="after" id="after"></a>After the Wire Frame Is Made</h3>
  <p>Having studied the construction of wire frames, and being able now to make
    wire frames in a variety of attractive styles, let us now see how these frames
    are covered. The wire frame is the foundation, the groundwork of the hat;
    but it is the covering and the trimming that determine the final attractiveness
    and charm of the finished hat.</p>
  <p>There are many various types of material for which wire frames are used.
    Transparent hats&#8212;hats made of lace, georgette crepe and net are built
    on a foundation of wire. Hats of straw, lace braids or horsehair are also
    made on wire frames. If the materials used are not transparent, the wire
    shape is first covered with light-weight crinoline. But if the braid or material
    used is transparent, the wire shape is covered with mull that matches the
    material used. This crinoline or mull cover is ordinarily used OK the outside
    of the crown and on the under side of the brim.</p>
  <p>Though there are many different kinds of materials, the methods of applying
    to the wire frame are very similar. The wires divide the hat into eight equal
    sections which are known to millinery as the eight points of the hat. Remember
    this. It is an important feature of millinery design which is taught later.
    In the meanwhile remember that the hat has eight points, and that the wires
    of the frame mark these points.</p>
  <p>Usually the first part of the wire frame to be covered is the brim. If you
    follow these step-by-step directions carefully you will find that it's really
    quite a simple matter.</p>
  <p>1. Take up your wire brim and lay it on the material with the straight lengthwise
    grain of the material running straight from the center front to the center
    back of the hat. Pin firmly to the frame at these points.</p>
  <p>2. Extend the straight crosswise of the material from the right side of
    the brim to the left side and pin at these points also.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illus/05-09-fig9.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',423,668);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/05-09-fig9-t.jpg" alt="Figure 9. Covered wire brim" width="220" height="137" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>3. Proceed to pin the material to the other four points, removing carefully
    any fullness that may be at these bias points. Be careful
    not to pull the material in any way to distort the shape of the frame. This
    is a mistake frequently made by beginners. Be sure that throughout your work
    the original shape of the frame is retained.</p>
  <p>4. You are now ready to cut around the frame. Allow three- quarters of an
    inch to turn over the edge of the wire.</p>
  <p>5.	After turning over the edge of the wire, proceed to overcast as illustrated.</p>
  <p class="clear">6. <em><a href="illus/05-10-fig10.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',415,669);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/05-10-fig10-t.jpg" alt="Figure 10. Covered wire brim" width="220" height="134" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Cut around the headsize, allowing once again three- quarters of an inch,
    this time to slash and turn over the headsize wire.</p>
  <p>7. Turn the edge over the headsize wire and oversew as indicated in the
    illustrations.</p>
  <p>The brim is now covered. You see it is not so difficult after all! And as
    you proceed, you will find that the beautiful hat that seemed such a mystery
    to you is really quite a simple thing to make providing you follow the steps
    carefully.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><a name="other" id="other"></a>Other Wire Shapes</h3>
  <p>If you can cover the sailor brim you can make all the different hat shapes.
    The brim may be turned up or down, made wide on one side or any shape you
    desire. The way of starting is exactly the same. I am sure that you are going
    to enjoy making all the different kinds of wire frames. You can use so much
    of your own individuality, and make shapes which it is not possible to buy.</p>
  <h3><a name="mold" id="mold"></a>Covering the Frame to Be Used as a Mold</h3>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illus/05-11-fig11.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',546,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/05-11-fig11-t.jpg" alt="Figure 11. Cocvering wire frame with crinoline" width="220" height="145" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>No doubt you would like to learn how to make a frame all in one piece with
    but one seam. You know the frames you purchase at the store are made in this
    way&#8212;in fact, some of them have no seam at all. First, the wire frame
    which has been made the shape you desire should be covered with crinoline.
    In this way the imprints of the wire will not show on the molded frame. Begin
    on the under part of the frame starting at the center front. Take a corner
    of the crinoline and pin it to the center front of the brim. Pin to the headsize
    as well as to the edge of the brim. In order to make the crinoline easier
    to handle and to make it stretch easier, steam it slightly. This will make
    it easier to stretch and will make it fit closely over all parts of the brim.
    This covering of crinoline must be perfectly smooth over all the frame. Be
    very careful not to bend the edge wire out of shape. (Fig. 11.)</p>
  <p>After all this has been accomplished, cut the crinoline to within one-half
    inch from the edge of the brim. Turn over wire and stitch close to the edge
    with stab stitch. The crinoline may be slashed at intervals if necessary
    in order to make a real neat turning. Next, cut material at least one and
    one-half inches from the headsize and sew it over the headsize wire. It will
    be necessary to make little slashes in order to make them turn over the headsize
    wire.</p>
  <h3><a name="molding" id="molding"></a>Molding Material Over Wire</h3>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illus/05-12-fig12.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',569,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/05-12-fig12-t.jpg" alt="Figure 12. Covering wire frame" width="220" height="151" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>It is very hard for a beginner to make a perfect wire frame on which to
    mold a shape. However, practice makes perfect, and it is only after continual
    practice that this may be accomplished. Place the buckram on the table and
    moisten it with a damp cloth. Care must be taken that it isn't too wet. Begin
    as you did when covering the frame with crinoline, that is, start with a
    corner and place the rough side of the buckram next to the frame and pin
    it to the center front at the edge of the brim, then pin it to the headsize
    the same as you did when covering it with crinoline. Fig. 12 will show you
    how the material is turned. Willow plate may be used instead of buckram if
    desired.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illus/05-13-fig13.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',537,820);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/05-13-fig13-t.jpg" alt="Figure 13. Finished brim" width="220" height="142" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Allow the material to dry thoroughly then carefully mark the place where
    the seam is to be, allowing the usual one-half inch for overlapping. Remove
    from wire frame carefully. The edge is then trimmed along the fold and the
    edge is wired and bound. This is done by cutting a piece of crinoline about
    1 1/2 inches wide. This is folded through the center, then pinned to the
     center back of the frame. Carefully stretch the crinoline, being sure the
    shape is not injured. Sew all around the brim using the stab stitch. No fullness
    should be allowed at the edge, for this may be removed by stretching. Fig.
    12 will show the method-of applying buckram and Fig. 13 shows buckram frame
    when it has been dried and removed from wire.</p>
  <h3 class="clear"><a name="covering" id="covering"></a><em><a href="illus/05-14-fig14.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,625);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/05-14-fig14-t.jpg" alt="Figure 14. Covered square wire crown" width="202" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>Covering the Crown </h3>
  <p>Perhaps the crown is a trifle more difficult to cover than the brim. Certainly
    it requires more care and more attention. Remember that neatness is the final
    test of good workmanship&#8212;and that without neatness your hat can have
    no charm, no beauty.</p>
  <p>1. To cover the crown, first cut a circular piece of the material being
    used, making it as large as the top of the crown. Allow three-quarters of
    an inch to extend over the edge of the top.</p>
  <p>2. Proceed to pin it in precisely the same manner that the brim covering
    was pinned. The straight lengthwise grain of the material should run from
    front to back; the crosswise grain from side to side. The fullness at the
    edge should be laid in even plaits. However, if this is so heavy that it
    will make an uneven edge, cut some of the crinoline beneath the plaits away
    and lap the flat edges.</p>
  <p>3. Now cut a piece of the covering material long enough to go around the
    side crown and to overlap one inch. Cut it one inch wider than the side crown
    is high.</p>
  <p>4.	Now turn one-half inch under along the upper edge and pin in place.</p>
  <p>5. Beginning at the center back, pin the turned edge even with the outer
    wire of the crown top.</p>
  <p>6.	Sew this edge to the crown top with long stitches on the outside.</p>
  <p>7. Turn the edge over the headsize wire at the headsize, pin in place and
    oversew.</p>
  <p>The method of crown covering just taught applies to the square crown. When
    the hat is of a less regular shape, it is better to cover the frame with
    mull which is very much more pliant than 
    crinoline. If the crown is round, the mull cover may be in one piece. You
    will have no trouble in covering this type of crown if you follow these steps.</p>
  <p>1. Beginning at the center front and center back, divide the crown at the
    headsize into eight equal sections.</p>
  <p>2. Cut the circle of the mull large enough to cover the crown and allow
    three-quarters of an inch to turn over the edge at the head- size. Crease
    exactly in the center by folding in half on the lengthwise and then in quarters
    on the crosswise grain.</p>
  <p class="clear"><em><a href="illus/05-15-fig15.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',620,590);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="illus/05-15-fig15-t.jpg" alt="Figure 15. Covered round wire crown" width="190" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a></em>3. Proceed to pin the straight lengthwise fold of the material, at the center
    front and center back; and pin the straight crosswise fold at the sides at
    the headsize.</p>
  <p>4. Now pin the point halfway between the center front and sides to the corresponding
    point on the frame.</p>
  <p>5. Between these points there will be a slight fullness which should be
    laid in small even plaits. Or it may be eliminated by cutting out small gores
    and lapping the raw edges. If the mull is very thin, it will fray badly;
    but if the mull is heavy enough this latter method is the best as it gives
    a flat, smooth finish.</p>
  <p>6. Having pinned the covering all around the headsize, turn the edge to
    the inside of the crown and overcast just as in the sailor shape.</p>
  <p>7. Perhaps the brim is turned up as in a turban. In this case, the covering
    is put on the under side and is applied in the same way as the covering of
    the sailor brim. Fullness at any part is taken out in the same way as it
    is taken from the crown. On the other hand, if there is not enough fullness,
    add gussets in their proper places. The frame is now ready for the braid.
    You see, you have only been preparing your frame for the braid covering&#8212;and
    now you have reached that important point.</p>
  <p>The methods just given for covering the crown will help you a great deal
    if you are planning on making a hat and covering it with braid. Of course,
    some seasons the wire crown is not in style and then we must hunt for other
    methods. I feel that it is necessary that you should know all the different
    secrets of millinery whether they are being used today or not, for no one
    knows just when styles that were used several years ago will be the present-day
    mode.</p>
  <p>The making or molding of shapes over wire is very interesting work because
    there are so many possibilities. Of course, the whole secret of the matter
    is in the making of a good firm frame that will withstand the handling. In
    order to obtain this kind of frame it is necessary to practice with wire
    and pliers to make sure that the wires are tied carefully and will stay in
    place.</p>
  <p>It is possible to make a good wire frame, cover it with crinoline so that
    the imprint of the wire cannot be noticed, for any type of hat given in the
    previous lessons or any variation of the types which you will see in the
    stores. To be sure, it takes practice to make these molds and it takes practice
    to cover them carefully so that the shape you are making is smooth and looks
    like the shapes purchased at the store.</p>
  <p>Suppose you are not making the wire frame to be used as a mold, but instead
    wish to make a transparent hat, which requires the wire for the foundation.
    Here again it will be necessary to follow directions very carefully to see
    that it is made exactly right. Each wire must be in the right place and must
    be firmly tied so that it will stay.</p>
  <p>The wire frame is of course much more perishable than the buckram frame,
    which we will take up in the next lesson. It perhaps requires more patience
    to make this frame, but at the same time it is a part of our millinery work
    and it must be mastered in order to learn how to make all of the many kinds
    of hats worn today.</p>
  <p>No doubt you have seen the pretty dress hats that are made of a wire frame
    and are covered with gold or silver lace. They are very popular and most
    appropriate for many occasions. These hats would lose all of their charm
    if they were made on a buckram frame, so you see the wire frame plays a very
    important part, not only as a foundation for a hat of this type, but also
    as a foundation for molding buckram frames.</p>
  <p>It is possible to make a wire mold over which crowns may be molded, but
    it is rather difficult to make unless one is very much skilled in the bending
    of wires. In the next lesson on the making of buckram shapes I am going to
    tell you how a crown may be molded over a wooden hat block or a wire reinforced
    buckram crown.</p>
  <p>Before leaving this lesson on the covering of wire frames, be sure that
    you have mastered each detail thoroughly. Have a little review. Go over each
    part of the lesson. Test yourself. See if there is anything you are in doubt
    of, anything you would like to have explained.</p>

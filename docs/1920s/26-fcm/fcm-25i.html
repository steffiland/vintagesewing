<h3><a name="child" id="child"></a>The Well-Dressed Child</h3>
<p> To the child reveling in the fascinating world of tops and marbles and dolls,
      clothes are not so very important&#8212;as long as they have plenty of
      pockets and are comfortable enough to permit of skipping rope and climbing
      trees. But to the "younger generation" &#8212; that vast army
      of eight-to-sixteen&#8212;clothes are mighty important, indeed. And especially
      are they important to the young folks who are standing timidly on the threshold
of youth, wondering vaguely about such things as picnics and birthday parties.</p>
<p> There is the young boy, for instance, gallantly carrying home for the first
    time the books of the "girl across the aisle." He wants to feel
    that his Norfolk suit is absolutely correct, and he wants to tell himself
    with a secret thrill of pride that she is admiring the colors of the stripes
    in his blouse. As for the young miss herself, she is perfectly miserable
    if her hair-bow is not the prevailing shade of red and her new school frock
is not bright and pretty.</p>
<p> It is in early childhood that tastes are developed, that ideals are moulded.
    One of the most vital problems of the mother is to clothe the child correctly,
    in good taste, and to allow that child every opportunity to express his or
her own taste in the selection of style and color.</p>
<p> Too many children fret uncomfortably in suits that are too tight, in huge
    sailor hats that droop down over the eyes. To many children are made self-conscious
    and awkward because they are dressed in an outlandish and uncomfortable fashion.
    Too many children are denied the chance of developing the good taste that
is inherently theirs.</p>
<p> What constitutes "good taste" in children's clothes, you
    ask? Surely it would be impossible to set down certain definite rules, for
    children in the city have vastly different requirements that children in
    the country. But there are certain fundamental principles which apply to
    children's dress everywhere, certain principles which every mother
who prides herself upon having good taste, should observe.</p>
<h3><a name="keynote" id="keynote"></a>Simplicity &#8212; the Keynote</h3>
<p> The first requirement of good taste in children's clothes is simplicity.
  There can be nothing quite so humiliating to a child as to be dressed in an
  elaborate, gaudy fashion that renders him conspicuous. It makes him awkward,
  self-conscious, ill-at-ease in the company of others. It robs him of the very
  charm which makes childhood so beautiful&#8212;the charm of absolute forgetfulness
of self.</p>
<p> The woman of good taste never dresses to attract attention. Her clothes blend
  with her personality, and instinctively one knows that she is well-dressed
  without noticing what she is wearing. The same rule applies to children's
  clothes. The young boy or girl should not be dressed in the kind of clothes
  that attract attention but the kind that blend with the personality of the
  child and create a pleasing impression without drawing direct attention to
the particular suit or dress.</p>
<p> After all, one would hardly expect elaborate clothes, with even the least
  suggestion of sophistication, for children. Childhood is simplicity itself&#8212;and
  the more simple the dress or little suit is, the more the charm of the child
  is
  enhanced. Put a little six-year-old miss into a gaudy creation of satin and
  lace and see how quickly she becomes an affected little coquette. But put that
  same child into a demure little frock of linen or chambray, with nothing more
  pretentious for trimming than a sash or a bit of smocking, and see how appealing
that child will be in her simple charm. </p>
<h3> <a name="comfort" id="comfort"></a>Comfort in Children's Clothes (Illustrations A and B)</h3>
<p> The child's figure is constantly changing. Little shoulders suddenly
  decide to square themselves; little figures round out almost overnight; tots
  scarcely more than three feet high decide that they will surprise everyone
  by increasing their height to four feet. Naturally, clothes become too narrow,
too high and too short in proportion.</p>
<p> Children's clothes, therefore, should be made with a regard for the
  ever-changing figure. Little dresses should have deep hems, and plenty of fullness.
  Suits
  for the young boy should be roomy and comfortable. Even underthings should
be made a trifle too large rather than just-right in size.</p>
<p> Absolute comfort is important in children's clothes. They should be
  in one piece, if possible, or buttoned where no pressure is caused. They should
  never be so tight that they restrict circulation, but should also be sufficiently
comfortable to allow the child every freedom of movement.</p>
<p class="clear"> Gla<a href="fcm-illus/25i-b.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',487,204);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="fcm-illus/25i-b-t.jpg" alt="Illustration B" width="84" height="216" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>nce <a href="fcm-illus/25i-a.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',491,201);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="fcm-illus/25i-a-t.jpg" alt="Illustration A" width="83" height="217" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>for a moment at Illustration A. It shows a little girl in a dress
  which is uncomfortably styled and therefore incorrect. Illustration B shows
  a dress
ideally adapted to the requirements of childhood.</p>
<p> Girls should have as much comfort of dress as boys have. This is especially
  true today, you know, when every feminine member of the family&#8212;from little
  sister to grandmother&#8212;is preaching the gospel of absolute equality! The
  day of the little girl who sat in a corner and embroidered while her more fortunate
  brother went fishing and hiking is over. Today, the young miss runs and skates
  and plays ball like her wildest brother&#8212;and her clothes must be made
  accordingly. The wise mother provides her young daughter with comfortable one-piece
  dresses that have bloomers to match&#8212;and young daughter is finding that
they are splendid for school and play wear. </p>
<h3>  <a name="what" id="what"></a>What Shall the Material Be?</h3>
<p> Children's clothes should always be developed in light-weight materials.
  In winter the materials should be warm, of course, but they should not be heavy-weight
  fabrics. The youngster is harmfully burdened by wearing heavy clothing, and
  the same degree of warmth can be secured by using soft, light-weight materials
which do not weigh down the wearer.</p>
<p> Following is a list of the materials most frequently used for children's
  clothes: percale, dimity, kindergarten cloth, voile, poplin, serge, gingham,
pique, khaki, lawn, madras, gabardine, corduroy. </p>
<h3> <a name="wear" id="wear"></a>For Playtime Wear</h3>
<p> Play is, and always will be, the language of childhood. The little girl who
  does not like to play hop-scotch, and jumping rope, and doll's house
  is not normal. The boy who does not cherish his marbles and tops more than
  anything else in the world isn't natural. The healthier and happier a
  child is, the more he plays; and the wilder his play becomes, the more strength
  and vitality he stores away for that stern business we call life which is to
come later.</p>
<p> Children should have plenty of play clothes in which they can do anything
  their exuberant spirits demand. They should not be denied the infinite pleasure
  of
  climbing trees and fences because some impractical dress or suit is likely
  to be ruined. They should not be made sullen and miserable by constant warnings
  to be careful of some foolishly frivolous little dress that should never have
  been made or bought. With the right kind of play clothes they can romp to their
  hearts' content&#8212;and mother will have no strain whatever in keeping
their wardrobes in order.</p>
<p> For the boy, there can be nothing more practical for play than a comfortable
  corduroy suit. Of course he may have his "best blue serge" for
  important occasions, such as when folks come a-visiting, but for school and
  play wear corduroy resists the most relentless ear and tear. For the very small
  boy who still reverts to "all fours" in his efforts to cover ground,
simple little rompers of some staunch, washable material are most appropriate.</p>
<p> The young girl is likely to be happiest in a pretty plaited skirt and middy
  blouse. She will be happier still if she has a pair of serge or sateen bloomers
  to wear beneath the skirt. Then she won't have to worry about catching
  ruffles on barbed-wire fences or crushing carefully laundered little frocks
  that have to be "kept nice for school tomorrow." Simple gingham
  dresses are always appropriate for the school-girl, and poplin is an ideal
  material for the miss who is still young enough to play, but old enough to
want to look pretty.</p>
<p> Play clothes should be dark of color and staunch of material. They should
  be made with plenty of roominess, and should be devoid of all trimming. Overalls
  are the boon of the busy housewife who has several young play-loving youngsters
  and washes all their clothes herself&#8212;and they are really quite simple
  to make. The one-piece jumper dresses for little girls serve the same purpose
  as overalls for boys and prove decidedly practical both for school and play
  wear. With a generous supply of practical clothes to depend upon, the youngsters
need not be denied the joyous (if rough) pleasures of childhood. </p>
<h3> <a name="dressy" id="dressy"></a>The Dressy Occasions (Illustrations C, D and E)</h3>
<p> But being a rather proud mother, as most mothers are, you insist upon frilly,
  pretty things for the "dressed-up" occasions when folks come to
  call. And you are right. Children should be impressed, from the most tender
  years, with the importance or correct clothes for certain occasions. They must
  know that their play clothes are not appropriate at dinner, or in the drawing-room.
  They must learn to respect the dignity of visiting and of helping mother entertain&#8212;and
their respect should be reflected in their dress and their manners.</p>
<p> Yet, as pointed out previously, children's clothes are not in good taste
  if they are elaborate and unduly attractive. The note of simplicity should
  be carried out in their dress clothes, with better materials and perhaps an
  added touch of style and trimming, to do justice to the important occasion.
  And this important occasion may be anything from a friend's birthday
party to Sunday morning at church.</p>
<p class="clear"> A <a href="fcm-illus/25i-d.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',482,201);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="fcm-illus/25i-d-t.jpg" alt="Illustration D" width="84" height="215" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>very <a href="fcm-illus/25i-c.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',479,209);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="fcm-illus/25i-c-t.jpg" alt="Illustration C" width="99" height="212" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>charming little dress frock for the young miss who is wavering between
  childhood and youth may be made of taffeta. If the skirt is made very full
  and short , and the bodice rather tight, with nothing but prim little nosegays
  of silk roses and leaves for trimming, the frock will be delightfully reminiscent
  of the days of the old-fashioned little girl who was "seen but not hear." The
dress described is pictured in Illustration C.</p>
<p> For the very young person who, when she isn't in mischief, is very
  much heard, nothing could be more dressy and appropriate than a crisp white
  organdie
  dress, sashed and ruffled in some youthful color such as pink or blue. The
  little frock pictured in D is what we have in mind for the four or six-year-old.
  It is quite simple to make, especially if one bears in mind the new quick method
of machine ruffling taught in <a href="fcm-07.html">Lesson 7</a>.</p>
<p class="clear"><a href="fcm-illus/25i-e.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',488,202);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="fcm-illus/25i-e-t.jpg" alt="Illustration E" width="85" height="216" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>When the young miss is "all dressed up" to help entertain visitors
  or to take a stroll with mother down Main Street, the tiny sister will insist
  upon something very fine too. If mother is wise, she will have a little linen
  suit tucked carefully away in the bottom drawer&#8212;and this is just the
  occasion when she will find it appropriate. The suit pictured in Illustration
  E is of white linen with neck and pockets of pink to match the chubby youngster's
  pink cheeks. You should have no trouble at all making pretty little suits like
this one, when you find the patterns you want.</p>
<p>Children should be taught very
    early the value of quality. The little girl who is provided with few clothes,
    but clothes of excellent quality and good
    taste, will not select gaudy, frivolous styles when she is a young lady.
  Good taste can become a habit the same as anything else. Rather let the child
  have
    few clothes of excellent quality materials, than many clothes of poor material
  and gaudy trimmings. </p>
<h3><a name="awkward" id="awkward"></a>The Awkward Age</h3>
<p> Awkward indeed, is the "awkward age"&#8212;both for the youngster
  and his or her parents. Who doesn't know some little girl who is "all
  arms and legs"&#8212;a little girl on whom every dress is either too
  short or too narrow? Who doesn't know some little boy who always seems
  to be in his own way, who always seems to be "growing out" of his
  clothes? It is a difficult problem, indeed, to dress children of ten to fourteen
becomingly.</p>
<p class="clear"> Opposite is a page of dresses<a href="fcm-illus/25i-05.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',482,203);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="fcm-illus/25i-05-t.jpg" alt="5" width="93" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>  for<a href="fcm-illus/25i-04.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',240,110);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="fcm-illus/25i-04-t.jpg" alt="4" width="90" height="220" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>  girls <a href="fcm-illus/25i-03.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',485,255);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="fcm-illus/25i-03-t.jpg" alt="3" width="120" height="217" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>of the <a href="fcm-illus/25i-02.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',487,202);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="fcm-illus/25i-02-t.jpg" alt="2" width="97" height="218" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>awkward <a href="fcm-illus/25i-01.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',240,118);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="fcm-illus/25i-01-t.jpg" alt="1" width="92" height="220" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>age. Notice particularly the dress marked 1&#8212;a dress
  especially designed to conceal the angular awkwardness of the young person
  and soften the lines of her figure. The round
  neck is youthful in its simplicity and the full-gathered skirt has a certain
  youthful grace. The dress, if it is for special occasions, may be of black
  velvet with lace collar and cuffs, for every since Charles I's children
  started the style, and Little Lord Fauntleroy followed it, black velvet and
  lace have been the boon of happy childhood the world over. But remember, that
  velvet is appropriate only for very special occasions when mother herself would
wear her very best and most elaborate gown.</p>
<p> Illustration 4 shows an appealing little frock for the awkward age. It is
  trimmed solely with smocking which forms the neckline and sleeves, and a wide
  girdle.
    When developed of crepe de chine, this dress is suitable for the dressiest
  of dress-up occasions. Of linen, it makes an excellent school frock.</p>
<p class="clear"> <a href="fcm-illus/25i-cav.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',427,485);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="fcm-illus/25i-cav-t.jpg" alt="Cavalier children" width="140" height="120" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>The children shown here are of the court of Charles I of England, early in
      the seventeenth century. Contrast the dress of the young girl and boy with
      the dress of children today. How could a little girl romp as little girls
      should, in such an awkward, uncomfortable frock! And how could the little
      boy thoroughly
      enjoy the sports of his day in the suit he is wearing! It is interesting
      to note, however, that even in those early days ruffles, tucks and plaitings
      were
    popular as trimmings. </p>
<h3><a name="choose" id="choose"></a>Let the Children Choose</h3>
<p> Children have tastes of their own&#8212;and they should be given every opportunity
    to develop these tastes. And one of the surest ways to develop whatever taste
    they have, is to allow them to choose colors and materials for themselves,
to select styles and change them to suite their own requirements.</p>
<p> Take the young girl with you on your shopping trips. Let her handle the materials,
    see the different colors, glance through the fashion books. Let her make
    her choice of color and material for her new dress&#8212;with your subtle
    help, of course. By suggesting to her what color and material will be most
    appropriate, but by allowing her to make the choice herself, you will be
    moulding her tastes along the lines of artistic development, and she will
find it extremely valuable later when she plans her entire wardrobe herself.</p>
<p> A great many mothers make the mistake of thinking that their children are
    merely vest-pocket editions of themselves&#8212;miniature men and women who
    have to be taken care of until they are able to care for themselves. But
    children are individuals the same as men and women, they have personalities
    of their own, and they have their own particular likes and dislikes. It is
    positively ruinous to the artistic tastes and ideals of a child to force
    him to wear a vivid red or bright blue when he longs for a dull brown or
    dark blue. His individuality is stifled, his development is crushed. His
    own clothes-ideas clash with those that are forced upon him&#8212;and the
result is the habit of bad taste which may remain throughout life.</p>
<p class="clear"> <a href="fcm-illus/25i-end.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',306,796);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="fcm-illus/25i-end-t.jpg" alt="Silhouette of children playing" width="140" height="50" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>If you have a little son or daughter, you have a life to mould, a destiny
    to direct. Do not prevent the artistic development of the child, as the shadow
    that hides the sun from the rose, prevents the growth of that rose. Give
    your child every opportunity to expand, to develop. Regard him as a distinct
    individual with distinct tastes. Instead of deciding everything for him,
    forcing upon him what your own tastes dictate, allow him to choose for himself.
    In self-assertion lies the path of development&#8212;and in development lies
the character of the future man or woman.</p>

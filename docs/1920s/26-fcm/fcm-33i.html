<h3><a name="correct" id="correct"></a>Correct Clothes for Every Occasion</h3>
<p> To wear beautiful, becoming clothes is not enough. To wear clothes that are
      an expression of one's individuality is not enough. There is something
      that is more important than fashion, attractiveness, personality&#8212;something
more significant than any or all of these.</p>
<p> You would not expect the man of good taste and judgment to attend a formal
    dinner in street clothes, would you? Nor would you expect a young woman to
    wear her shopping dress to the dance. Clothes are governed by the occasion&#8212;and
    if one would be considered a person of good taste, one must heed carefully
the dictates of correct dress.</p>
<p> There are certain "unwritten laws" governing the clothes worn
    at a wedding. Mourning, for instance, is considered a breach of good form&#8212;an
    indicating that the person is lacking in good taste. For that reason, people
    in mourning are not expected to accepted wedding invitations. Similarly,
    there is definite, correct dress for the dance, the tea, the dinner, the
theatre&#8212;every occasion of everyday life.</p>
<p>And so we find that in addition
    to our knowledge of fabrics, design, the creating of clothes and the conforming
    to certain individual types, there
    is also the important question of correct clothes for every occasion. Without
    his knowledge, one cannot truly be called an expert modiste&#8212;a fashionable
    creator of beautiful clothes. It is not for oneself alone that the knowledge
    is important; but if the clothes-maker ever makes clothes for others, she
    must know what principles to embody in the evening gown, how the tea gown
should be made, what type of dress is appropriate for street or theatre wear.</p>
<p> It is really a study in itself&#8212;this consideration of correct dress.
    We know you will find it fascinating. By telling you exactly what to wear
    to the wedding, dance, theatre-party or dinner, it increases your poise,
    your self-confidence. It will enable you to avoid embarrassing inconsistencies
    in dress&#8212;and show you the way to be always, at all times, dressed in
    accordance with the requirements of the occasions well as the requirements
of fashion.</p>
<h3 class="clear"> <a href="fcm-illus/33i-01.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',433,273);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="fcm-illus/33i-01-t.jpg" alt="Woman in wedding gown and veil" width="120" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a><a name="wedding" id="wedding"></a>The Wedding Gown&#8212;and Trousseau</h3>
<p> There is a certain fascination in making a wedding gown, in planning a trousseau,
  in creating dainty, much-beribboned wedding things. Let us first have a little
  chat about the trousseau and find out just what is correct for this all-important
occasion.</p>
<p> Of course, when we think of a trousseau we think quite naturally of billows
  of creamy white linens, of exquisite under-things, of beautiful embroideries.
  But these items must be dependent entirely upon the individual&#8212;upon the
  extent of one's purse and the demands of one's taste. What we are
  chiefly interested in is the wedding gown itself. How shall it be made? What
shall the material be?</p>
<p> White is the color for brides. Since time immemorial this has been the color
  used to denote purity. The exclusive use of white for brides is supposed to
  have grown out of an old custom of the ancient Patagonians who covered the
  body with white paint on the eve of the wedding ceremony. The material used
  may be heavy crepe de chine, white brocade or satin&#8212;preference being
given the latter.</p>
<p> As for style, always remember that the greatest charm of the bridal gown
  lies in its simplicity. A gown that is elaborate defeats its own purpose, and
  is
  an indication of poor taste. The occasion is a solemn and dignified one&#8212;and
the gown should be made extremely simple to harmonize with the occasion.</p>
<p> Most wedding gowns are made with a train and the skirt is almost always draped.
  For evening weddings, the gown may be sleeveless. The veil may be either of
tulle or lace.</p>
<p>But what should the trousseau contain, you persist? To list the
  articles that should be included in the trousseau would be as ridiculous as
  it is impractical&#8212;for
  this is a matter which is entirely dependent upon convenience, circumstances
  and personal preferences. We can only make suggestions which may be followed
as one thinks best.</p>
<p> There is something strangely beautiful in the thought of making one's
  trousseau. Indeed, there is an old tradition to the effect that the bride who
  makes her own trousseau "sews happiness into the wedding outfit." The
  garments included in the trousseau should be sensible, useful things. Everything
  useless and merely ornamental should be omitted. Undergarments should be made,
  with a regard for wear and utility. Linens should have deep hems finished with
  neat hemstitching instead of flimsy laces or embroideries. Household and personal
linens should be embroidered in the bride's maiden initials.</p>
<p> If a honeymoon trip is planned, the trousseau should contain at least one
  smart dress of serge or poiret twill for street wear; an afternoon frock or
  two of
  georgette crepe, satin or taffeta; an evening gown for the important occasions;
  a semi-evening dress conservative in style; a dark-colored suit with several
  gay little blouses. However, these are merely suggestions and may be followed
as one sees fit. </p>
<h3> <a name="wear" id="wear"></a>What to Wear to the Wedding</h3>
<p> Now let us see what the wedding guest is expected to wear. Surely, one does
  not wish to draw attention to oneself by being incorrectly dressed at so important
an occasion as a wedding?</p>
<p> If the wedding is held in the morning or afternoon, the gown should be of
  satin, georgette or taffeta. Some of the newest modes favor lace. Sleeves should
  be
  elbow-length or full-length. The style of dress depends upon the figure of
  the person and upon the prevailing fashion. Elderly women should select dark
  blue or brown, but for the younger women the lighter shades are preferred for
the early wedding.</p>
<p> Then there is the evening wedding, resplendent with the colorful gowns of
  fashionable women. Here one wears one's "best"&#8212;for
  the evening wedding is considered formal. Elaborate decollete is usually worn
  if the wedding
  is held at church, although one need not be so formal for a small home wedding.
  The style of the dress may be either bouffant or straight-line, according to
  the requirements of the individual figure. Only the finest silk materials are
used for evening gowns.</p>
<p> Because it is a beautiful occasion, one is expected to wear beautiful clothes
  to the wedding. By beautiful clothes we do not mean elaborate clothes, necessarily&#8212;but
  clothes that are well-made, well-finished and with just enough charm and artistry
  in their construction to do justice to the solemn dignity of the occasion.</p>
<h3> <a name="dinner" id="dinner"></a>Dinner Dress</h3>
<p> The regard for correct dinner dress is more marked in the city than it is
  in the country. City life has a certain strict formality which is entirely
  lacking
  in the country, yet which on invariably finds at such important country occasions
  as church festivals, subscription dances and dinners given in honor of celebrated
guests.</p>
<p> The woman who receives formal dinner invitations, should have at least one
  evening dress in her wardrobe. If she is tall and slender, she should choose
  a bouffant style&#8212;and it may be made of a soft, clinging material or taffeta
  if one prefers. Of course, one would not wear an evening gown of this kind
  to a chummy little dinner where all are the closest friends, but only to pretentious,
formal affairs where everyone appears in "full dress."</p>
<p> If one is inclined to be the least bit stout or short, the slender silhouette
  should be chosen. It must be developed of a soft material, such as satin, silk
  brocade or any other soft, silken material. Lace is appropriate, also. This
type of gown should be made with long lines and straight panels.</p>
<p> In selecting materials and colors for evening gowns, one should bear in mind
  the requirements of the individual, as taught in an earlier lesson in the course.
  Absolute harmony between the gown and the personality of the wearer is essential.
  For the older woman, we suggest jet; for the younger woman gold lace or gold
  tissue. The gown should have a train only when it is extremely simple in design;
an elaborate gown because gaudy when a train is added to it. </p>
<h3> <a name="tea" id="tea"></a>Clothes for Tea-time</h3>
<p> Both in France and America, tea-time is considered the most fashionable time
  of the day. It makes no difference whether the tea be formal or informal&#8212;one
  is expected to wear one's prettiest and most becoming frock. In summer,
  one wears delicate, dainty frocks of light, gay-colored materials. In winter
  one wears frocks no white less pretty, but heavier and more substantial in
the weight of material.</p>
<p> One of the most favored materials for the afternoon frock&#8212;which is
  also the tea-time frock&#8212;today is satin. Chiffon, crepe de chine, georgette&#8212;or
  a combination of any two of these&#8212;are also favored. Colors vary from
  the deepest tones of brown to the brightest shades of green. As fashion is
  almost always in a colorful mood, you should have no trouble ins electing and
combining colors that are individually becoming, and at the same time appropriate.</p>
<p>The
  young girl who goes a-teaing should wear a dress made simply of soft folds
  of the material, finished with a huge sash and bow of tulle or chiffon. When
  one is older, the dress may be beaded georgette or embroidered satin&#8212;as
is most becoming.</p>
<p> If the tea is given in honor of one's debutante daughter, she should
  wear a gown that is at once simple and dainty, cut quite low in the neck and
  boasting tiny sleeves. It is most becoming if it is of georgette in a very
pale pastel shade. </p>
<h3> <a name="lawn" id="lawn"></a>Lawn Parties and Garden Fetes</h3>
<p> Just as one expects flowers in the spring-time, so does one expect frivolous
  little frocks at the lawn party or garden fete. Nothing less than a gay little
  summer frock, a parasol to match and a flower-trimmed hat will harmonize with
the garden or lawn background.</p>
<p> For the garden-party frock, there can be no material more ideally suited
  than crisp organdie. And this is especially true when the color of that organdie
  is orchid or Nile green. The dress may be as simply or elaborately styled as
  one pleases, but one particularly pretty little frock we have in mind was trimmed
  solely with a profusion of tiny pin-tucks on the skirt and around the neck.
  Silk floss embroidery added a touch on contrasting blue (the dress was of orchid)
and the silk cord girdle was of blue to match.</p>
<p> Of course, this would not be an appropriate dress for the older woman. For
  her, we suggest a dress of dotted Swiss, crepe or French lawn. The color should
  be light, but the style simple. Sunset yellow has, somehow, the propensity
  of being attractive both to youth and age; lilac is ideal for the older woman;
  black should never be worn to a garden party or fete. Styles may be simple,
  but colors should always be as gay and rich as the colors from Nature's
very own palette. </p>
<h3> <a name="dance" id="dance"></a>Dance Dress</h3>
<p> One does not attend dances unless one wishes to put oneself into the spirit
  of the dance and respond to the rhythmic cadences of the music. To be appropriate,
  one's dress must be in accord with the occasion&#8212;and to be in accord
  with this gay, happy occasion one's clothes must be bright-colored and
attractive.</p>
<p> When the dance is held in the afternoon, the young person should perhaps
  wear a gown of organdie or taffeta, extremely youthful in style, for dancing
  and
  youth go hand-in-hand, you know! The gown may be a combination of colors or
just one pale pastel shade. It should be trimmed gaily with flowers or ribbon.</p>
<p> For the older woman, it will be necessary to select a gown more suited to
  her years. Canton crepe, crepe de chine and satin are widely in vogue, and
  trimmings
  are usually gay in note&#8212;although the style of the dress may be somber
  to match one's tastes. Navy blue taffeta trimmed with silver cloth is
ideal for the older woman at the dance.</p>
<p> The evening dance assumes the more pretentious and dignified name of "ball." Clothes,
  to be appropriate, are therefore more elaborate. One may wear one's most
  elaborate evening gown, if one is older. For the very young person the lines
  should be bouffant and youthful; a pretty frock would be of soft green or soft
  rose chiffon velvet trimmed with bands of silver ribbon. It may be sleeveless
or with tiny sleeves.</p>
<p> The young miss who is introduced for the first time to society at a ball
  should wear a gown either of white or a delicately tinted shade. The most popular
  materials are tulle, net, chiffon or silk georgette. The neck is often cut
in a heart-shape and the dress usually has tiny sleeves.</p>
<h3><a name="theatre" id="theatre"></a>Dress at the Theatre</h3>
<p> There is a very discouraging tendency to over-dress at the theatre. The place
  for gay dress is in the ball-room or at the formal dinner&#8212;not at the
theatre.</p>
<p> When you attend the matinee wear a simple street dress of dark material.
  During the summer months, daintier fabrics and lighter colors are permissible.
  Avoid
ostentation and gaudiness; dress that is worn in public should always be simple.</p>
<p> Evening dress is worn to the theatre when one sits in a box. This evening
  dress should not be as elaborate or as decollete as the dress worn to the formal
  dinner or dance. Those who site in the orchestra may wear full or semi-evening
  dress as they desire&#8212;but those occupying the less expensive seats should
wear plain street clothes.</p>
<p> The very same principles of correct dress that apply to the theatre apply
to the opera too. </p>
<h3> <a name="street" id="street"></a>Street Clothes</h3>
<p> As for walking or shopping, there can be nothing more appropriate than a
  smart, tailored suit worn with a neat blouse of French voile or batiste. The
  woman
  of good taste is never conspicuous, never gaudy. Her clothes are always well-made
  and fashionable, and they are always appropriate to the occasion when they
are worn. </p>
<h3> <a name="church" id="church"></a>Dressing for Church</h3>
<p> It is absurd to dress gaily when one goes to worship in the solemn sacredness
  of the church. Yet how many people do we see in bright-colored, extremely-styled
  clothes! Here is one occasion where incorrect dress reveals forcibly the lack
of good taste and judgment of the wearer.</p>
<p> To be entirely in accord with one's mood at church, clothes must be
  sombre, quietly and inconspicuously styled. In summer, a simple dress of crepe
  de chine,
  untrimmed save for soft folds of the material, is most appropriate. White is
  splendid for summer wear at church for it is cool enough for the summer warmth
and simple enough to do justice to the solemn occasion.</p>
<p> Gowns of velvet, satin or georgette may be worn to church in the winter.
  But they may not be the least bit elaborate. A bit of embroidery or beading
  is
  permissable, but anything elaborate is in bad taste. Gloves should always be
worn.</p>
<h3>  <a name="mourning" id="mourning"></a>When One is Mourning</h3>
<p> Mourning is worn as a sign of reverence and as an expression of sorrow. To
  mourn for some beloved one, we relinquish pleasures for a stated time&#8212;and
one of these pleasures is fancy clothes.</p>
<p> A neat, simple frock of black is usually worn. No trimmings whatever, not
  a touch of color. All black and severely simple in style. Widows wear long
  crepe
  veils falling almost to their knees. No jewelry is worn except a dull jet pin
  if one wishes it. After a year, the widow may wear white or lilac combined
  with the black, but it is not considered correct to return to bright colors
until after a period of two years has elapsed. </p>
<h3 class="clear"><a href="fcm-illus/33i-02.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',428,274);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="fcm-illus/33i-02-t.jpg" alt="Business woman" width="120" height="200" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a><a name="business" id="business"></a>The Business Woman</h3>
<p> Women in business should be extremely conservative in dress, wearing clothes
  with simple good taste. The well-dressed business woman gives the appearance
  of being well-dressed without anyone stopping to think what she is wearing.
There is nothing gaudy or attractive in her attire.</p>
<p> However, the business woman need not confine herself to severely tailored
  suits and high-necked blouses. She may express her art and taste in clothes
  just
  as freely as the woman whose clothes are judged from the social viewpoint.
  Indeed, she has the opportunity of showing even better taste than any other
  women&#8212;for in business she has the opportunity of combining common-sense
  with correct fashion. In making style selections, the business woman should
  avoid all "fads." She should never select the type of garment that
  will probably be worn a month or two, and then discarded as hopelessly out-of-date.
  Anything extreme is in bad taste. Ostentation of any kind, gaudiness and elaborate
attire are detrimental to the ultimate success of the woman in business.</p>
<p> The woman who wishes to be strictly tailored, should wear a smart suite of
  English tweed. Heather is a good color as is also a grey or brown mixture.
  Suits of this kind should be worn only with plain white voile or white batiste
blouses such as was made in the previous book.</p>
<p> Dresses for the business woman should be dark-colored and simply-styled.
  One-piece dress are ideal and every business woman should have at least two.
  With dresses
  of this type a small toque or turban should be worn, black or tan shoes, or
oxfords, and a very plain but smartly styled coat.</p>
<p>  Women everywhere are realizing more and more the value of correct dress for
  every occasion. We no longer see women in silk frocks on the golf links&#8212;but
  women who wear smart golf suits entirely suited to the occasion. we no longer
  see women shopping in satins and furs as they used to in the cities&#8212;but
  in sensible, inconspicuous clothes appropriate to the last detail. Instead
  of slavishly following a stupid mode, women are using their own taste and intelligence&#8212;and
the result is better dressed women everywhere in the social and business life.</p>
<p class="clear"> <a href="fcm-illus/33i-end.jpg" onclick="popUp(this.href,'console',326,800);return false;" target="_blank"><img src="fcm-illus/33i-end-t.jpg" alt="Silhouette of women and child outside shop window" width="140" height="54" hspace="5" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /></a>In the following lessons, you are going to learn how to make tailored clothes.
  This type of clothes is appropriate for business wear and sport wear. Whenever
  you plan a new dress or blouse, whenever you decide upon a new suit or a new
  skirt, know even before you start just what occasions you want the new garment
  for&#8212;and make it accordingly. If you want a ball dress, a wedding gown,
  a business dress&#8212;refer back to this lesson and be sure that you, as a
  fashionable modiste (for that is what you will be when you have mastered the
course!) do not commit any inconsistencies in dress. </p>
